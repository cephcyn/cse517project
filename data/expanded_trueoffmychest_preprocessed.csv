&gt;''It's all in how you raise them''

That's cute, that still doesn't change that different species of animals were selectively bred for certain traits, or evolved to have certain traits, a lion evolved to have a huge prey drive for example. A pit bull was selectively bred to kill animals in pits, and to show no warning signs of sudden, explosive aggression. In the vast majority of cases these animals were lovingly raised since they were young, and still snapped without provocation, or minimal provocation such as falling, having a seizure, or just existing. 

&gt;''MY [dangerous animal] is sweet, and wouldn't hurt a fly!''

Literally every dangerous animal owner has this to say before their dangerous animal either killed them or someone close to them. I can show you pictures of baby tigers not killing things, that doesn't nullify the danger there is, even the most dangerous of animals can do 'cute' and normal things. If your pet is statistically responsible for disproportionately more deaths and maimings than any other kind of animal in its class, I'm still going to accept it's dangerous regardless of your anecdote.

&gt;''You're more likely to be attacked by a [much more common, smaller animal that hasn't killed anyone] than a [larger, more dangerous animal that has killed tons of people/is known for killing people]'' 

Yeah.. comparing something of minimal risk compared to this *other* thing that carries a *huge* risk when it happens is like me saying that coconuts kill more people than plane crashes, so you're perfectly safe owning a 737 MAX and flying it every single day.

If you're Democrat, Republican, Independent, or anything else, that's irrelevant to this post. This isn't an accusatory ""You voted for the right/wrong candidate"" post, nor is it me advocating for one candidate or another.

No. This is squarely aimed at people who complain about wanting political change (or anything politically-related that their vote could matter for) and - when it comes down to it - finding it inconvenient to actually take the time out to do it.

I cite this as an example and *only* as an example, one of many I've seen for years, and only due to the recency factor of it: One of my friends (31 years old) has been all for Bernie Sanders. With Super Tuesday yesterday, they've been complaining today about Joe Biden's success. Turns out, despite all their chest-beating about their support of Sanders and desire for change... *they didn't even vote.*

Many excuses over the years are always the same: ""My vote doesn't matter,"" ""My state is going to vote [insert candidate/party] anyway,"" and so on. And I get it. Politics can be draining. It can feel insurmountable. The game can feel rigged. It's easy to be disillusioned.

But if you're not even going to *try* to exercise your right to vote for the change you want, then you've already lost. Disillusion is born from apathy. You don't like Donald Trump? You don't like Joe Biden? You don't like Bernie Sanders? You hate what boomers have done? Then stop posting memes about it and vote, because while you're sitting back complaining that Trump is president or that Biden is edging out Sanders or that boomers are still shaping the future, the very people you decry *are* out voting, making *their* voices heard.

Again, whether their voices are right or wrong is irrelevant and an argument for other posts. The point is that someone who voted for Biden or Sanders exercised their right. Someone who has voted (or will) for Trump exercised their right. Older folks exercised their right. Conservatives, liberals, or anyone else you may be in opposition to exercise their rights.

Even if you vote for a candidate that seemingly has zero shot, at least you voted for who and what you believe in, and in doing so you have just as much authority as anyone else who voted to criticize (or praise) the system.

And I decided to press charges against my dad. Or at least go to the police. I'm protecting my sister's privacy but after hearing from her and knowing she believes me, I finally feel like I can do it.

And struggling to eat and survive and having to borrow money from strangers on Reddit to eat and buy prescriptions while he lives his life scot-free is not fair to me. Maybe that's selfish but after everyone found out what I said about being molested by him, I've been homeless, had to go without eating, living in cities I've never been to. And his life just went on.

And this week I finally let myself think about what if I'm not the only one. What if he's done this to someone else or will do it? 

I'm terrified that no one will believe me. That they will say I consented so it doesn't matter. I'm terrified that people will know. But I won't be able to live with myself if it happens to someone else.

That's when my (step?) uncle came into play. And not as a father figure; but as a friend. Ever since he met me, he's always been there for me.

I can talk to him about everything without being judged, attacked or looked down upon.

In the last four years of my life, he's helped me more than people I've known my whole life.

Yesterday, my step dad was throwing a dinner party for his birthday and the whole family was invited. It's been a few weeks since I've talked with my uncle so I was excited to see him and see how he's doing.

While looking for him, I accidentally overheard a whole conversation between him and my step dad about my uncle's past.

My uncle, although not affiliated anymore, used to run gambling scams and prostitutes for people. Just hearing about it broke my heart; my step dad spared no details in the conversation.

I still love my uncle and think he's the most important person in my life and would do anything for him but hearing everything about his past made me sick and heart broken.

And so I rejected him. He took it well and we had a blast going together to prom as friends instead, even if he was a bit heartbroken. He stayed one of the most good-hearted people I've ever met. We lost touch after that summer when he enrolled in the military and I went away to uni. We didn't hear from the other for at least a year. 

Fast forward to December 2019, my rejected friend shows up at my birthday party. I expect a socially awkward, introverted man and instead I'm confronted with a this chatty, goofy military recruit with a thousand stories to tell and who has obviously been working out. We somehow click aaaand I knew I was screwed. When I eventually admitted to him I started liking him *a lot*, he admitted he had never stopped crushing on me, he just had given up on hopes to be with me. Hence why he was six months into an long distance relationship. I was a bit heartbroken.

The relationship between them was fairly shaky, so it all came crashing down not too long after we admitted our feelings for each other. Soon after he asked me to be his girlfriend a second time, the man being head over heels for me the same way he was when we were 17. I said yes!

My now ex boyfriend and I had been dating for a year. We had started very unconventionally and the foundation for our relationship was not the strongest by any means, but we were head over heels crazy about each other. As with most relationships, time went on, we got comfortable, and I felt like I wasn’t being seen or heard. It had been an on going conversation for some time until it finally came to a head, we got into an explosive argument, and mutually decided to call things off. We had a couple of very good follow up phone conversations and I was under the impression that we were on the same page, with still a lot a love, understanding, and the shared decision to give each other space. His family is wonderful but they live far away so I told him he could reach out if there was an emergency. He texted me later that night, I asked if he was ok, he responded saying he was fine and just wanted to say he liked our conversation earlier, to which I didn’t reply. Before I knew it my phone was blowing up with phone calls and he is telling me that an ambulance is on the way to him because he believed he was having a seizure. He asked me to meet him at the hospital. My gut had told me that physically he was ok and the break up triggered a paranoid and manic state to which he created a reality that he was seizing in an attempt to get me to the hospital. I went, but told him that nothing was going to change because of this. He was showing very clear signs of a manic episode. I love him so much, but know this is toxic. I am carrying so much weight and guilt. I am feeling so much pressure from my family to cut communication entirely and immediately. If this had been a car accident, I would be there with no doubt of my own or questions asked by my family. But because it’s his mind it’s assumed that he’s not really hurt and these things are in his control. 

I have informed his family and some close friends so they are aware of his current condition. I talked to the doctors at the hospital and told them everything I knew.

To make this not *too* long, please excuse my lack of proper grammar.

So often I see young people saying how depressed they are, how it won’t get better, how it seems hopeless, and how they want to die. I used to be one. Now I’m glad I never killed myself.

Sure, my childhood wasn’t as bad as others. But it wasn’t as good either. Average probably. Middle class at first. Both parents had jobs. 2 siblings. We had a house. Parents loved each other. Mom cared for us a lot. Dad probably loved us in his own way but beat us enough to get sent to jail once for it.

Mom got cancer when I was maybe 12. Dad had insurance from work but it wasn’t enough. He spent his entire savings and retirement fund to save her. She fought it for two years but didn’t win. Dad was devastated. Props to him though for never turning to alcohol or drugs. He still tried to work hard.

He worked at a catholic school and he and another teacher discovered unethical (illegal?) activity by the principal. They approached the arch diocese to disclose it and they were promised protection if they testified, so they did. In the end, both lost their jobs. Principal kept hers.

No income and no savings. Dad couldn’t put food on the table for us. Neighbors in our town drove to our house to give us food. Without them....I don’t know what would have happened.  Grandparents came and helped with cooking and chores too. 

We nearly lost our car and home. Thankfully, over a year later, our father got another job at less than half his original salary. We were probably just barely above the poverty line.

Definitely not as bad as some but worse than others. 

Meanwhile, I was struggling with gender issues. Yes, transgender feelings years before the word “transgender” was common. Saw a psychologist under the pretext of “I was worried about my grades.” Was too scared to tell my religious father myself so I had the psychiatrist do it. His response “Well as long as you’re not gay (like men), I guess I can accept that.”

Right before my 18th birthday, I started hormones. But until this point, I wanted to die. I didn’t know there was any hope for me. I never thought there was. I spent nearly every day of my teenage years wondering if and when we’d become homeless. When our dad would hit us again. When he’d throw a tantrum and destroy things in the house. When I’d ever actually feel happy. When I’d ever stop worrying about grades and securing a future for myself.

At night I couldn’t sleep and took OTC medicine to put myself to sleep every night for years. I told my dad I was depressed and suicidal and he brushed it off and told me I wasn’t. If it wasn’t for my cat (sad, I know), I probably wouldn’t have stuck around. She was my only comfort.

When I started hormones and said I wanted to transition I was told by my father “I support you, but I won’t allow you to do that under my roof. If it’s what you want, you have to leave this house.”

I did.

I went to college on scholarships and loans and worked my butt off. I thought that would be my key to the future (spoiler alert: college definitely isn’t everything, but most of you probably knew that.)

Worked two part time jobs to pay for rent and books and food while attending classes. Sleep deprived. Trying to afford hormones and make time to see doctors and free social workers. And during my weekends and vacation I spent time teaching myself Japanese as it was my childhood dream to someday leave America and live in Japan. Even though I knew it was just a fantasy, I didn’t want to give up.

So I spent my time trying and trying to become happy and fight my depression.

Walking through the city I wanted to jump in front of every bus. Look over the edge of every tall building I went up. Hopping a gust of wind would come and push my cowardly self over. Dreamed of jumping down into the subway tracks and just get torn to shreds by a high speed train. 

Saw three different psychologists who all diagnosed me with different stuff. Took several different meds that changed nothing except made me sleepy. 

Graduated. Economic recession. Degree useless. (Biology with a teaching certification) Eventually found a tech support job. Guess my hobbies and part time work in college paid off. So much for those tens of thousands of dollars on college classes.

Dead end job but nice enough co-workers. Crazy city. Homeless everywhere. Atmosphere dripping with hopelessness. Dirty. Smelly. Loud. Expensive. Horrible relationship with a free loader girl I didn’t love anymore but couldn’t bring myself to kick her out and make her homeless too. Encouraged her to get a job too but she refused. 

Turned 21 and those free social workers weren’t free anymore. Had no health insurance. Slowly managed to save up money. Transition going well *enough*. Managed to change my name. Began living full time as female. Gf cool with it but too in the closet to tell her family. Can’t blame her though.

Told by religious fanatics I’m going to hell. Not only family, but also by strangers. Family tells me not to show my face to my grandmother anymore as it would break her heart. (Thankfully years later I did anyway and she said she loved me regardless of my gender. Bless her heart.)

Just work, come home, cook, clean, pay bills, buy food, gf just watches vampire shows and reads vampire stories all day. I’m so done. “I’m going to kill myself.” Was my thought almost every day. Crying myself to sleep and wishing life wasn’t so hard. (Again, now I know I didn’t have it as bad as others, but it also wasn’t as easy either.)

Finally, I’ve had enough. “Maybe this depression and hopelessness isn’t just inside me. Maybe it’s what’s around me. If I don’t get out of this and do something, I’m going to jump in front of that bus / subway tonight.” So I decided to take a gamble.

I looked for teaching jobs. An advertisement on Google recommended teaching in Japan. Teaching and Japan. Two of my goals in life. So...I applied.

I used my savings to fly across the country for an interview. I got the job? I got the job....I got the job!

Sell almost everything I own. Say goodbye to deadbeat gf. She had nowhere to go but I gave her 6-month notice I was moving overseas and she had to find a job and her own place. She did nothing. When I left, she was standing on the side of the road with a suitcase of her things.

Use the rest of my savings and money from selling my belongings to buy suits and fly to Japan. I took almost nothing except clothes and my laptop. 

Started work as a teacher with no experience, no ESL qualifications, and almost no training. Somehow do a good enough job to keep getting my contract renewed.

Surprised my company accepts a transgender person like me. Students and staff don’t even care. Somehow become the most requested teacher in the school.

Depression fading away. For the first time in an decade I feel genuine happiness. But still days of crying and wanting to die and things feeling hopeless. Figure it’s just a chemical imbalance. But thinking I made it this far and things have been getting better. I should keep going.

Introverted me summons the courage to walk into the only gay bar in my countryside town. All men. I can *speak* almost no Japanese.

Members only sign. Who cares. I go in. Turns out members only sign is just there so straight folks don’t accidentally stumble in without knowing what kind of bar it is. 

Owner realizes I can’t speak Japanese. I’m sitting alone. He calls this girl who can speak English. She and her gf come. Speak English. First friends outside of work. Exchange contact info.

A year later she introduces me to her friend. Girl’s cute enough. She likes me. Doesn’t care I’m trans (wtf my brain). So far only person who has cared was an old US dude.

Start dating. Two years later, we get married. Her family is totally cool with me (again wtf? Not only do they not care I’m trans but also identify as lesbian...) Visit their family regularly. Even her grandparents like me...???

Quit my job to start my own business to become the teacher I dream of being. But I lack confidence and creativity and actual knowledge on how to *really* teach English.

Struggle for a few years. Manage to get some students. Tell them all I’m lesbian and trans because just in case they care and they come to my home and it’s not like I want to hide it. No one cares. Every single student signs up.

Finally decide to apply for naturalization. Gather all my documents. Interviews almost every month for about 6 months. Interviewer doesn’t care I’m trans. Barely comes up. Biggest problem is my middle name. (Japanese have a very hard time understanding what it is and why it’s optional to write on US documents.) Constantly insist I must be hiding something by not having written my middle name on some documents but having written it on others. They’re convinced I have some horrible hidden criminal background for months.

Apply anyway.

Somehow works out. Become Japanese citizen. Give up US citizenship. Proud not to be American anymore. Childhood dream accomplished.

I vote in Japan. Feelsgoodman.

Money’s no problem. Can’t believe we actually have money. Can’t believe I have good health insurance. Can’t believe I don’t need to worry about my next meal or becoming homeless anymore. But I’m working day and night making lessons and materials alone. Managing contracts and scheduling alone. It’s too much. Stress is mounting and feels like my lessons suck and I’m letting down my students.

Still having random bouts of depression. See a psychologist here. National health insurance makes it so cheap. Get depression meds. Also so cheap. They work but also make me feel on auto pilot and I can’t think deeply anymore. I hate that constant “Yippee! Go go go!” feeling. Stop taking them. Again, decide maybe I need to change something in my life instead of only taking meds. 

Decide to travel to Tokyo for 6 months every weekend to take a class and get proper training for teaching. Stay in a net cafe every night to save money (frugal mindset never leaves you, even when you get money later).

6 months later, I finally know what the heck I’m doing. Lesson quality increases 9001%. Confidence getto. 

Start teaching my arch nemesis: kids. Tell all their parents I’m lesbian and trans and have a wife. No one cares. Every student signs up again. Still not many students but still getting more!

Former co-worker introduces me to her company. They also don’t care I’m trans. Start conducting English workshops for international companies and tourism associations. 

Married. Wife’s family loves me. Students. I can be the teacher I want to be. Freedom. Rewarding job. Enough money. A house. Safety. No one telling me I’m going to hell. No debt except a mortgage. Healthy. And most importantly to me, enough time to enjoy my hobbies and spend time with my wife.

Honestly, I can’t wrap my head around it. Even now. Middle school me...high school me...college me...none of them would believe this if I could tell them. At the time, I was totally convinced I’d become homeless or a victim of a horrible crime or, most likely, dead by my own hand.  I felt so hopeless for so many years and wanted nothing more than to take myself out of this world.

I’m really glad I didn’t. 

So all you folks on this sub and Reddit...if you are feeling like I did and even if your situation in life sucks right now...there is hope that things will get better. Somehow, things got better for me. Not just better, but I’m living a life I never ever thought I’d have. It’s honestly far more than   I deserve. But the future is always unknown.

Whatever you’re struggling with now, even if it seems totally out of your hands, there will come a time when you can take charge and make a change. And if a chance doesn’t present itself to you, make one yourself.

And even if you lose sight of one dream, replace it with another.

Don’t give up! I hope this story can give you a little hope to go another day, week, month, or yet. Until you obtain your own happiness.

I believe it’s out there somewhere. Just maybe you can’t see from where you are in life. And if you can’t see it or know how to get it, you can always *make* a way!

Good luck!

They basically told me to fuck traditional gender roles and I had to be the traditional, dominant ""male"" figure as a woman. 

Up until recently I've been going along with it but now as a young adult I'm realizing that none of this is appealing. I don't want to wait until I'm 40 and financially stable as a health professional to go through geriatric pregnancies and to have kids just for my husband to raise them full time. I don't want to be the provider. I don't even like STEM. 

Talking to my partner about our future goals is making me realize that I really need to reconsider everything. I honestly melted when he said he's trying to graduate early (so he can start professional school early) so he can take care of me and we can have kids sooner (and I can be a stay at home mom like I want to). If I quit my professional track, I'd still do something relatively lucrative, but not anything that makes as much as a health professional (or racks on that much debt only to work none to barely part time and not be able to pay it off myself). 

If I do change career paths, my parents and friends are probably going to call me weak and stupid and dependent on a man, but I honestly don't care. I want to focus on me and what's going to make me happy. I don't care if I'm falling into my ""traditional gender role,"" it's what's best for me and that's all that matters. I just want to have kids early, be able to do what I enjoy as a stay at home parent (cooking, art, gardening, and raising animals), and have my supportive partner do what he wants to do, which is take care of me and our future family and just enjoy our life together until we die. 

That being said, I know so many women who are exactly the way my parents tried to make me and they're very happy and successful individuals, but it's just unfortunately not for me.

I had friends of every race and didn't really think much about it. As I grew older, I learned about systematic injustices and absoltuely agreed they needed to be.  

Then, one summer in college, I worked at a restuarant (in a fairly white but diverse part of town) where a large percentage of our clientele were African American. While I did have a few ""karens"" or stuck-up white people, and really had shitty people of all races, the majority of my experience with African American customers was negative. They constantly tipped less (or not at all), ruder, dirty looks, insulted me, given the middle finger, got called a bitch for not letting a table leave without paying, seeing a coworker brought to tears because how a large party was treating her, etc. I left because I genuinely felt abused by a good percentage of the customers. I've always been a big believer that you can true character of a person based on how they treat those they perceive as less than them. In my experience in the restaurant industry, African American failed that test miserably. It really shifted my perspective in a negative light and I'm still working on overcoming it.  

After college, I got a job in my field and became a teacher. For a while, I the prejudices seemed tk By far, the majority demographic I struggle the most with classroom management and write referrals for are African American students. Plus, after I transitioned at school, I lost the complete respect of several black students, several started stopping by my classroom merely to gawk and/or laugh. They're the only ones who I've ever had to redirect using ""gay"" as derogatory. Literally no white, Asian, Middle Eastern, or Indian students cared; in fact a few said supportive things in private. I'm just like ""no wonder transwomen of color are more likely to be murdered."" I can't stand how loud they are, when they walk down the halls blasting rap music for everyone to hear, dress like thugs, and in fact the whole rap/hood/ghetto culture just rubs me the wrong way. It really does comes across as glorifying violence. Sometimes I'm like ""How did we get from the Harlem Renaissance, jazz, blues, soul, and The Cosby Show to gangster rap and calling the characters on Blackish 'white washed'?"" While us white people look back with disgust with shame about what our ancestors have done, sometimes I wonder if black people of the past are seeing their children and grandchildren and going ""What are you doing?""

When I was about 15-20 I would hang out with friends from school and the church where I was active.  We would have activites, game nights, go out and do stuff, general fun things you would do with friends.  I would text people asking them to hang out and people would text me as well.  At least once or twice a month I would hang out with my friends.

Once I finished high school I slowly stopped hanging out with those people, and when I slowly stopped going to church the same thing happened with those people.  Then I moved to a new city just before my 21st birthday.

I lived there for about five years and I met some people I thought I would consider friends.  Looking back at it now it was just work acquaintances and I hardly ever hung out with them outside of work.  This is when the ""nobody invites me anymore"" phase started.

I remember inviting a people over a few times to play games, but not very often.  Looking back on it I think it happened maybe a handful of times.

Then I moved again, bought a house, married my fiancee at the time, and now it starts all over again.  This time it's worse because I work from home, everyone I knew from the previous two cities haven't talked to me in years, and I'm terrible at forcing myself to go to public events to meet people.  Not once in three years have I gone out to try and meet new people.

I've met a lot of people online that I thought were friends but now I realize they're just more acquaintances.  I try to play games with people and it hardly happens, I hardly ever get invited to play games with people, and I have no consistent dialogue with these people.

Please don't continue to read, if you could get triggered by suicidal or depressive thoughts. 

On Thursday, 13.02.2020, I wrote a suicide note at work, wrote to all my friends who were far away and said my good- byes.

I was 100% sure I was about to kill myself that evening. My thoughts stating how disgusting, horrible and worthless I was, were getting louder and louder and they were consuming me. I've heard a voice in me tell me over and over again that I deserved dying and that I was bringing pain to everyone. The world was better off without me.
I knew that those thoughts weren't mine. It was my depression talking and it was so easy to let it take overhand. I just gave in and it was so easy to believe.

Once I got off of work, a friend called me randomly, another person wrote me the whole time I was at work. I told neither of them what I was planning for I didn't want help from anyone. I just wanted to die. 
My friend talked about random stuff with me the whole time I was on my way home. I don't know how it happened but somehow I found myself at home. I just fell to bed and everything just slipped away. I didn't want to be found by anyone after committing suicide, for I didn't want to traumatize anyone else. I thought I'll just do it tomorrow if not today. 
I felt tears running down my face as I fell asleep.

The next morning I woke up and everything was gone. For the first time in years I feel so alive. I feel like myself again. I can laugh and finally feel again. I got several messages that day, telling me I matter. For the first time in forever I could feel the love that surrounded me. I could appreciate the people around me without being exhausted by everything and anything. I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in so damn long.

Well, here I am, seeing life in a completely different way.

I'm happy. Very happy. Life's not perfect, but I have hope again. So guys, thanks for reading this. I'm full of love suddenly, something I struggled to feel for so long. I'm so damn happy suddenly.

My father filed for divorce from my mother over a decade ago when I was a young child, and I have lived with him ever since.

Up until a few weeks ago, I only knew that my dad filed for divorce because my mom cheated on him. Well, that's true, but that's not all there is to it.

Before everything went down, my mom had reconnected with her biological dad who had been divorced from my Gramma when my mom was a child and has been absent for most of her life. He lives out of state and drove hours to come meet all of us as a family. He stuck around for a few weeks and then left suddenly. For years my father had told me it was because he had tried to get my mother to come back to his home state because he missed her so much, but the other day I found out it was because they were sleeping together.

My mother and her biological father were sleeping together and my dad caught them when he came home from work on his lunch break.

I don't know what to fucking do. 
I have since seriously contemplated killing myself because I am so disgusted at the thought of being this nasty, vile woman's daughter. For years our relationship was strained because I knew she cheated and I didn't want much to do with her, but within the past few years I have been more forgiving and we have gotten close. All up until now. I want to throw up so hard that my insides come out with all of it. I don't want anyone to look at me or talk to me. I feel so disgusting from the inside out. To make matters worse, my mom is moving out of state tomorrow. Before, I thought she was abandoning me all over again but now I think she is trying to run away from her whole life. She's having a goodbye dinner with my siblings tonight but I'm not going. I cant look at her. I hate her so much. My siblings don't know. My dad tried to hide it from us all these years and I found out on accident by overhearing a conversation, and then I confronted my dad about it. I am so ashamed. I just want to cry and hide.

It didn't even sink it at first when I went to the hospital and they told me, but my dumb ass needed a second opinion before accepting the truth, delaying my treatment by a whole fucking year and probably doing irreparable damage to my brain in the process. It's shit, but I've been dealing with it the best I can.

What I fucking hate hearing the most is people telling me that ""it's going to be alright!"" or ""you'll make it through this!"". I understand the power of a positive mindset, but what the fuck is lying to myself going to do for me?   


My life has no direction now because I can't plan for shit. I'm 25 years old and the years go by faster and faster and my life just passes me by as I'm unable to do shit about this condition I'm afflicted with. I've been big my whole life, but I could still move around without a problem, I used to enjoy going for walks for 2-3 hours some days to just give me space to think. now I can't even walk to the store 5 blocks away without feeling dizzy and exhausted in no time at all. I'm gaining way too much weight since I can't go for my daily walks like I used to. Shoveling junk food and Chinese food into my face uncontrollably to cope with my depression doesn't help with this at all of course. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's absolutely no way I can hold down a job and lead a normal life as I am now, though my mom thinking getting a part-time job will be good for me . I don't want to tell her I start about a third of my mornings by throwing up because the whole room is spinning and another third I'm either too dizzy or fatigued to even function. I don't want her to worry more than she already does.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm too scared to talk to a lawyer about long term disability even though at this rate I'm going to need it. I can't help but think that they'll think ""hey look it's a 25 year old young man looking for a free check from the government, he's not actually disabled!"" even though this omnipresent dizziness and fatigue makes it impossible for me to function normally. It's so fucking hard to even accept that I'm disabled but every time I stumble down the street to get to the store or try and go for a walk I can't help but remember that I'm fucking useless.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even feel confident streaming like I used to anymore, I used to enjoy just trying to make whoever came into my chat laugh, but all I feel these days is a looming dark cloud above me and I can't focus on shit for long. Someone asks how my day was? All my thoughts throughout the day come to mind. When will my body just stop cooperating with me entirely? When will my body just decide it's done with my shit, and then I end up like one of the many other people at the specialist's office? I don't want to be confined to a wheelchair. I don't want to be a fucking burden on everyone in my life. I don't want to lose the things I love the most to this disease, but as the good days become fewer and further between, at some point I fear it's going to happen.   


I just want to fucking break down and cry. All the time. But I really can't, I have to hold it together for everyone else. Everyone else that tells me ""It's going to be okay!"". I can't just give up on myself no matter how badly I want to. I can't even say shit like ""It'd just be easier if I were dead"" (I'm not suicidal it's just a fact right now. ) even if I'm joking. I can't even laugh at myself because I just end up breaking down. And come my birthday this year, I'll be 26 and no longer covered by my parents insurance. Meaning I not only get fucked by my body deciding not to function, but the American ""Health Care"" system gets to fuck me as well!  


I can't tell the people in my life who care about me all of these things though. I know they're saying these things hoping I'll be alright and I'll get through this all and be fine, but that's just not practical. I don't plan on dying, so I've got a long road of suffering ahead of me. It's not going to be okay, and that's okay.

I’m going to go into extreme cases as well (extremely high or extremely low intelligence) and how big of a difference it actually is.

So to start it off, I had my IQ tested and results came back at 90, many would consider this average but I personally consider it low just because of how little brain power I have compared to those who were lucky enough to get high IQ. I consider myself inferior to those who have high levels of intelligence because of how much they can do with their intelligence.

I can’t become a good programmer (I’ve noticed I’m not as good at problem solving and recognizing patterns like a few of my more intelligent peers were) I can’t really become a master at anything academically (like calculus, or just math in general) I am really only good for basic math, when it comes to the advanced stuff I just feel like I’m in a completely different world, I’m just not good enough.

I hate when people say “oh you can just work hard and become good at it” because that has never worked for me, trust me I’ve worked as hard as I could my brain just isn’t built for it.

I want to compare someone with 50 IQ and 300 IQ now. Nature can and will weed out the one with the lower IQ. It’s like humans vs tigers, humans have access to bombs because of their superior intelligence and can blow up the entire tiger population, or hunt them down with guns. Even though the tiger has more physical power, it’s no match at least on this planet. Now back to what I was saying, the one with 50 IQ can’t compete at all, give them both a year to develop a plan to kill the other, the one with the high IQ would probably have created some extremely advanced technology that allows them to easily destroy the inferior one, the low IQ person would probably grab a stick and think it’s good enough to win.

I have depression that has been ignored by my family for ages. I need serious help and one of the bad ""coping"" habits I have is stress eating. 

I'm already showing some signs of diabetes and I'm already overweight. It's fucking saddening to put on clothes you could fit just months ago just to get slapped in the face with the fact that you... expanded and can no longer fit it. I hate being fat with a passion but I don't know what to do. 

I poured all my savings into buying a treadmill last month but school stresses me out and I never have the time to use the thing. My parents buy nothing but junk food and it's literally the only option I have to eat. And I know if I get stressed or depressed (which is always) I'll stress eat and will only make it worse. And when I think about having to inject myself with needles every day just to stay alive it stresses me out more, which leads to the eating... you see where this is going. 

I know I need literal and serious professional help to get through my issues. My mom insists on playing ""Mrs. Shrink"" and basically told me that if I can't console with her my problems then I can't go to a professional. Yet some of my problems are because of her and the rest of my family for private reasons.  I would do things on my own but I'm broke.

I just needed to vent it out somewhere. I'm just gonna make a list

1. People around me don't like me. They're fake towards me and I'm the punchline if some big joke
2. I'm not good enough at anything. My academics, sports and extra curricular activities aren't exactly the best. I have a fear I'm gonna fail further in life 
3. I have a need to please people. I want to make everyone around me like me, cuz i was bullied for years and no one liked me, it caused a large gap in my human interaction, especially  positive ones. I'm still recovering
4. I'm unlovable. I'm bisexual. Never been in a relationship, everyone thinks of me as a person who they would never date. 
5. People whom i love will leave me and i won't feel sad. Idk why, but that's a fear
6. My future is doomed. I'm not particularly smart or good at anything. I'm just there
7. My appearance. I'm fat and ugly. That's it.
8. I need validation for everything. I never got any from my family aside from them just going ""he's a good boy"". I'm in need of validation and emotionally weak.

 All I've ever wanted was children. I didn't meet my husband until I was 40, I had PCOS which makes it  harder to get pregnant and usually multiple miscarriages.
When I met my husband I was done being the woman who took care of the man financially. I was $200 short of my bills every month. I was desperate to move because my fiance cheated on me so I kicked him out. 
I was also his in home care giver so I lost over a $1,000 a month in income and 70 lbs in 3 months. He had started a fight with my family and I chose him over them so when he left me I was alone. 
My  friend who had spent her life as a ""pastor"" didn't approve of me trying to online date to alieve the loneliness I felt at home ALONE. 
She went from Daddy to husband, both supported by Daddy. 
So she stopped answering my calls and sent me a Dear John letter on FB and then blocked me. Her reason was that she couldn't sit by and watch me continue to get hurt. Now I really was ALONE. 
I moved to a little town to work at the new Ross Dress for Less. 
Three months later I met my husband on Plenty of Fish. I really want to write a FUCK YOU letter to my former best friend. 
My husband (36) was a virgin when I met him so there were issues with him bring able to ejaculate. I found out it's actually a common problem, when I googled it.
We were married one year later on May 3rd, 2014. I knew that I had serious kidney stones in both my kidneys  but I was asymptomatic but I did not realize they were multiplying. 
After many tears, trips to urgent care, an ultrasound,  they finally did an x-ray. 
April 2015 I had multiple kidney operations to remove the stones.
 June and July 2015 I'm finally feeling normal and pain free. If you've had kidney stones you can imagine the pain I had been in off and on for months.
July 2015, due to my time off work, unpaid, we were forced to file bankruptcy. Through all of this my husband amazed me by rising to the challenge.
August 2015 I start getting random stomach pains. The pain continues to get worse. I would double over in my chair at work, stuck in a fetal position and running to the bathroom. Finally someone orders a CT scan. 
January 2016 as I'm driving the 20 minute commute to the Dr. Office for an urgent appointment, two days after my biopsy, I remember thinking these are the last 20 minutes I have of hope before I'm told it's cancer.
I knew before he opened his mouth. I knew when the urgent Care Dr was elusive in answering my question as to what would cause my lymph nodes to be enlarged. He referred me to my Dr. 
I've had 3 biopsies in the past and really wasn't that concerned. In November, four months before my diagnoses, I told everyone not to do gifts because I knew there was something seriously wrong, deadly wrong.
My husband cried all the time. Not a man who likes to give hugs or cuddle, he would spoon me every night and cry silently until the back of my shirt was soaked. 
February 2016 I start Chemotherapy. May 1st, the day of our first date. May 3rd our two year anniversary. May 5th my 43rd bday. Passed without celebration. 
May 25th my last day of chemo. I never had my menstrual cycle again. I can never have children. 
September 2016 I start getting cramps in my calves so severe it curled my feet and I couldn't walk or straighten out my feet. SO painful. Then it happens in my stomach and I could not stand up straight.
I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia when I was 22 but I chose not to believe it. Now I get two more opinions, without telling them my previous diagnoses. My Dr says if I don't quit my job it will kill me. The atmosphere was beyond anything I have ever seen. 
It seems like every day it's a new symptom. I'm so stressed at work that I vomit until I pee my pants.
In addition, during this time I develop a polyp inside my vagina that feels like it's on fire and raw and so painful to sit, I worked in an office...
They cut it off. OMG I would almost rather have kidney stones. 
They also do a pap smear at the same time. They call me at work to inform me that I have HPV and the cells are active so I need to come in every year for a check up until they are no longer active. I don't understand it but I do know that I gave it to my husband 100% sure, even though there's no test. He doesn't deserve to  be in my life. All I've brought him is pain and yet he says I saved his life. He says I'm enough and he doesn't care if he has kids, I'm enough. I want kids, I've never imagined my life without them. I loved all my friends kids.
The polyp returns almost immediately this time she ""scoops"" it out making sure to get the roots. It comes back immediately. She doesn't believe it so they keep telling me it just needs to heal. 
Nope, it came back so to make sure she got it all she did an apisotomy. Believe it or not this caused pain for 18 months. My husband is a saint. 
April 2019 My husband gets a promotion and we move to one of the most beautiful vacation spots. 
I want to do foster care. I want to help children and hopefully have the family and life I always wanted. 
September 2019 After a horrible 9 month process, that was supposed to be 90 days max, we are licenced. 
November 14th we get the call that a 13 year old boy needs to be moved because it's not working out, but he's very sweet and just needs to feel wanted and loved unconditionaly. 
It's been hell. He has ODD, PTSD, and ADHD that has yet to be treated. Anytime his phone is threatened he throws a 4 to 5 hour fit of banging on the walls and door, throwing things, yelling insults at my husband who works very hard, at a job he hates, to provide for us. 
If my husband is not around he thinks it's funny to rub his penis on me. He's obsessed with it and he has ODD so anything I say just eggs him on. I didn't want to say anything because I wasn't sure how my husband would take it. I figured he just wanted a reaction 
Last week I was playing Minecraft on my phone with him and my back was to him. He says my name and all of a sudden his erect penis is in my face. I had my hands in fists and he kept trying to pry my hand apart to grab it. My eyes were closed because I didn't want to look at his penis and I heard him say something about putting it in my mouth. I kept my lips together but he ran his penis across my mouth and gave a giddy giggle and said ""now you've tasted my penis"". I shoved him as hard as I could. Before I could leave he ejaculated. 
I feel dirty. I feel like a pedophile. Who is going to believe me when there is no history of sex acts before? What about my husband? He opened his heart and home for me and this is his thanks. He lies about everything even when confronted with the truth. 
I told his counselor because he needs help, they said it was confidential. 
Saturday morning CPS shows up and my husband has no idea what's going on. His findings are that I should have said something sooner but there is no neglect. He makes me promise if it happens again I would call 911. Oh and BTW the social worker knew he was over sexed and aggressive with other kids, yet she even talked to me about getting more kids without saying a word. Had I known, I would have said something the minute he took his penis out. But I don't think it would have made a difference.
Monday he comes out of his shower naked so I can look at his rash right next to his balls. Even a visit from CPS didn't phase him. Later that night he worked himself into such a state that he was reaching for the knives. I called 911, for the third time in 7 days. My husband came home to 3 police cars, and three cops, he knows all the cops from his job, and we live in a town of 1,200. The closest big city is 4,000 large. 
The cops had to break into Michael's room and it was a shit show. They said he has no respect for anyone and until he does he doesn't deserve the privilege of a cell phone and if he was their kid they would take it away until he shows respect.
After they left he started throwing things at my husband's head. When we locked the door he almost broke it down so I made my husband unlock it. More items and vulgar insults thrown. When our downstairs neighbor said she was calling 911 he finally stopped because he said if they come twice in one night they automatically take him to juvi?! I don't know, he lies about everything. 
I'm so conflicted. I told him I would love him unconditionaly so what does that say if one more person fails him? We are his fifth home in 3 years and he spent a lot of time in respite because they needed a break.
I'm exhausted mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. All I do is cry. All my husband does is worry because CPS made me tell him. All my husband said was ""do you know how bad I want to beat his ass? I need to take the dog out so I can cool down. He came back in 2 minutes and treated Michael great and took him to his favorite game store so he could play Magic. 
Don't even get me started on the first 40 years of my life, they weren't any better.

I grew up poor, real poor. Like we had to steal food from the store to eat. My dad was in the picture but he just wasn't really around much, and he had severe alcohol issues so my mom kept me away from him as long as I can remember. He's a good man, despite the others that are going to come into this story. He just had his demons. 

My mom tried her best, she had me when she was really young (16). When I was about 10, she met a guy that eventually became my sister's father. He was an emotionally, and physically abusive asshole to both myself, and my mother. He continues to fuck with my sister to this day and is generally a waste of oxygen and resources. We had to stay with that asshole because my mother is satisfied with getting zero education and working dead end jobs. Eventually mother left him after being bankrolled by my grandfather, and we were happy for a short minute from when I was about 13 to 18. We were still poor, and despite being uneducated she managed to find a decent taking care of an old farmer. He died around the time that she found a new guy.

I managed to do well in school and sports despite my less-than-ideal upbringing, and got a full ride scholarship to a D1 university. I still had to take student loans to pay for my housing. Around this time she moved in with the guy that she met.  She sold ALL of our furniture for dirt cheap and moved in with this jabroni. He turned out to be just as bad as her last husband. He routinely kicked her ass and abused her, and once again, she was trapped because she refuses to find better jobs or educate herself. I couldn't do anything about it or I would lose everything that I worked so hard for. I gave her thousands of dollars of my student loan money to get her out of that house. She stayed with a friend, and then tried to kill herself. This was during my freshman year of college. After her suicide attempt, she ended up developing a drug habit.

She also had a one night stand with guy number 3. He's the worst one of them all. She ended up getting pregnant in her late 30s, and had my little brother. He's great, but his father is a piece of shit. After vehemently fighting against the family saying the child wasn't his, the DNA test proved it, and they moved in together. Things were okay for a few years, and I told her ""It's good now, but it can go to shit fast. Get yourself an education, a good job, something with a retirement"" but she's satisfied working minimum wage, dead end jobs, if she's working and letting these men pay for everything. Things were \*okay\* for awhile, but lately he has been beating her, threatening her with weapons, and being constantly abusive towards her. Once again, she is trapped. She has no job, no vehicle, and she can't leave. This is the THIRD time that she's done it to herself.

He shut off her cellphone, and I put her on my plan so we can actually communicate. I am fucking livid and I want to do something about it, but I will lose everything. She can't leave him because my sister had a suicide attempt, and the courts won't allow my mother to leave the county because of some court order.

I am a military officer, and an Iraq/Afghanistan combat veteran. I have seen my fair share of violence and I do not fear it. However, if I lay a finger on him I will lose my job and my security clearance, and who knows what he would do in revenge when I'm gone if I retaliate.

I'm mad at these shitbag men for being general shitbags. I'm mad at my mother for ALWAYS trapping herself, and doing nothing to further her career and earn any sort of real income so she can dig herself out of these shitty situations, or even have a working vehicle. She's never learned her lessons I'm mad at myself for being so helpless. I could easily beat the shit out of these men, but the consequences are just too high. She has already tried contacting the law. He lied and said she hit him, and they arrested my mother instead.

They were married young and it was good relationship until they had kids and he changed for the worse. He controlled her and emotionally and what I would call sexually abused her. Yes a wife can be sexually abused. 

She posted an ad on Craigslist that she wanted a partner but it was a long explanation of what she was looking for so I responded. After thoroughly reading her post on Craigslist I responded because I could tell that what she needed was what I had been through and I thought I could help her in more was than just sexual. I could be a friend a teacher teacher(we we're both interested in tantric sex) and a lover. She was a strong Christian woman and I am a good Christian man I know that this sounds funny for the circumstances but it worked out. I had conditions if we were going to do this and one was that I did not want to be involved with her kids and 2 she had to work and I mean seriously work on saving her marriage. I had been through a divorce and it sucks so marriage had to be worked on. 

Long story short we did practice tantric sex and a lot of self discovery things happen. She gained self confidence and got help from our preacher and a counselor. Yes that is our preacher as it turned out We attended the same church but we never knew each other because it was a large church. We would occasionally run across each other in public but you would never even know that we knew each other in a public setting church, grocery, restaurant etc.. We would get together 2 to 4 times a week and share some quality time together and talk have coffee whatever the situation. No it was not always sex. 

About a year into this relationship progress was finally made with her husband but their relationship still needed a lot of nurturing. After two years things were going better but still not healthy for a marriage and more importantly how the children were seeing how their relationship was going. They finally got their problems worked out and through it all I like to feel that I helped her in so many ways. This is a long story and there were so many dynamics that were involved and lots of emotions to be sorted through. I do not feel bad about any of it and glad that I was able to be there for her to sort it all out. Sounds bad I know but happy all the same that I saved their marriage.

We no longer talk but I am good with that.

He kept trying, and I kept telling him 'no' in nice ways. I found out he has borderline personality disorder and that also interfered with our friendship in totally different ways.

Blocked him on all social media and my phone.

Of course, whatever your internet connection, the first ads load instantly. Skippable ads are most common, so you have to be on guard, completely ignoring the ad to get ready to skip. Realising this, YouTube added unskippable fifteen second ads, where you can get two or even three in a row. 

If you're not in a position to skip ads, such as when listening to, rather than watching, YouTube, you can be subjected to three minutes of ads per ad segment.

So you've spent around a minute on useless, low quality ads before even knowing if you want to watch the video. Assuming you do, you will probably have to suffer around thirty seconds of buffer throughout the video, because all of YouTube's servers are dedicated to ads, whilst they use a potato battery for the videos.

Here's where ""YouTubers"" enter the fray. Forgetting the days when YouTube videos were made by those who just had something they wanted to share, people now make a living as content creators. And, let's be honest, some of these people work very hard. Others stretch three sentences of content into a ten minute video!

But YouTube gives their content creators, or at least those they give anything, a paltry portion of the money they generate for the site. So these creators resort to sponsorships. Ten seconds at the start, around two minutes at the end.

Do not forget of course that whilst YouTube demonetises videos they deem unpalatable to advertisers, they still stick ads on those videos, because they're sure as hell not gonna miss out on that sweet profit!

So you're watching a fifteen minute video. You get a minute of ads, some buffering, then a ten second in-video ad. Some drawn out content later, another one minute ad break. Then later, another. You get to the end of what you were watching, and two minutes of sponsorship. Then, before you can move to another video, another as break!

Of the total 20 minutes spent trying to watch a video, around 8 minutes are wasted on ads and buffering. That means you're only spending 60% of your time on anything you actually want to! And there are very few channels that use your viewing time efficiently.

This is far beyond the legal advertising standards set in many countries, and is completely fatiguing as a viewer. The whole service is choking on its own greed and I hope they realise they need to start being a bit fairer to the viewers and creators that run their platform for them.",True,False,,False,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,481513,public,self,YouTube ads are put of control!,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/evft1w/youtube_ads_are_put_of_control/,no_ads,0.0

Plus, everybody is freaking out over his death like they new him personally. I get Shaq and his old teammates being genuinely upset and maybe the larger professional sports community to an extent, but people that I know personally are more distraught over Kobe’s death than they are some of their family members. No shit, one of my friends who in the last year lost both grandparents and their younger sibling. People she’s know her whole life, but she’s equating Kobe’s death to that. She’s never even been in the same state as this guy but his death is on the level with the deaths of her family members. 

This is just fucking ridiculous. He was a professional athlete. He wasn’t a humanitarian or somebody who was committed to the betterment of all mankind. I understand he worked with charities, but what athlete doesn’t? And as far as charities go, teaching kids to play basketball is ranked somewhere between saving whales and making sure orphans have a nice Christmas. It’s nice, but it’s not helpful. Taking it a step further what about Red Cross members who are working for the betterment of the world and end up dead in some horrible accident? Why don’t they get weeks worth of recognition?

Most of us don’t care what you do or what you are, as long as you aren’t hurting other people. Please, come to church. I guarantee most churches will welcome you with a warm smile and a hearty handshake. Maybe a potluck and a new friend or two. 

All the time on the Internet, I see broad generalizations of Christians that typically sound something like “An old/crazy/racist/misogynistic/all of the above person! Must be a Christian lol!”

No! Those people do not speak for me. The people who volunteer in homeless shelters and pay for the next person’s meal in the drive through and play with animals in their local shelters, those people speak for me. Even if they never say anything about God, they speak more for me than these jerks who claim to be Christians then go and represent a loving God by hating anyone who isn’t like them. These idiots try to represent a book that specifically tells them that they have no reason to judge others, by judging people. The jerks of the church are idiotic hypocrites, and I sometimes wish they didn’t claim to follow God in the first place! Because at least then, I’d be able to follow my loving, amazing God without scaring people away the second I tell them I’m Christian. 

People assume that since I’m Christian, I must be some kind of oppressor. Some kind of backwards 18 year old girl who believes that all women belong in the kitchen. Some believe that I’m a homophobic person, who believes that abolishing slavery is the worst thing that ever happened in the USA. I believe none of that. Some people judge me before they even know me, and I hate it. I hate that no matter how hard I try to be nice and tolerant to the people around me, it doesn’t matter. Some people will throw years of kindness away because I’m a Christian, and apparently Christians aren’t human. 

We aren’t all nut jobs with a tendency to hate anyone who dares cross our path. I’m trying my best to be kind, despite popular belief regarding my religion, and sometimes it isn’t enough.

As a male victim of sexual assault, and as a gay black man that faces much discrimination, I'm outspoken about these issues. But, especially on reddit, I find it almost impossible to talk about these issues, or to say anything even slightly in disagreement with a woman on these issues, without being subject to angry insults and verbal abuse. If you even disagree with a small part of what a woman is saying, while agreeing with the core of the argument, she flies off the handle and assumes you're disagreeing with every part of it. Here's an example from today, I got called a rape apologist despite making it clear that I think Kobe is 100% guilty. https://imgur.com/a/vovizAa. I was literally just trying to explain the semantics of what Kobe said, while clearly stating that hes a rapist, yet this lady assumes I'm arguing in defense of him??? 

And don't get me wrong, I understand the anger. I get why this issue infuriates people, and I even get that there's a ton of men that come on reddit and defend rapists or deny the issues that women go through, or try to pretend like men have it just as bad. But I get justifiably pissed off about issues that men face, like the invisibility of male sexual assault victims, yet when I try to talk about them I get scolded for my justifiable anger, or I get lectured on how women have it worse despite not making any comparisons to women. Or how my anger obfuscates what I'm trying to say, while if a man told them to calm down while talking about their own rape they'd tear him a new one. I posted a simple one sentence comment about how men face discrimination, and get called a white neckbeard (check my recent history). And then when I posted an admittedly long af reply I get insulted, mocked and she refused to read what I had said. That's another thing that infuriates me, women will post a long comment telling you off and then when you reply they'll laugh and say fuck off, not even read what you said. Women have this condescending attitude where they'll lay into you about stuff, acting like I should greatly respect their opinion, but when I post a polite reply they have no desire to listen to what I have to say. I'm so fucking tired of women acting like these are simple issues and a two sentence blurb can perfectly sum things up. And then raging at me when I try to talk about the complexities.

It doesn't matter how I try to approach the issue. Doesn't matter how clearly I explain my views, or establish that I'm not a misogynist. Women will ignore every part of a post and focus on how one sentence means I'm a shitty creep. Even if the sentence right before disproves her accusations. No matter how calmly I state my opinions, no matter how hard I try to not draw any comparisons between men's and women's issues. Women will see that I'm a man defending men, and immediately assume that I'm some MRA. I've made posts about male victims and had it misconstrued as ""not all men"" type arguments, when that's not what I said at all. I've even had a post where I described my sexual assaults ghostbanned on r/offmychest, likely because most of my assaults were perpetrated by women and that doesn't fit their narrative. They didn't even take down my post, they just ghosted it so no one could see it and make me think no one cares about my issues. Oh and on that topic, a lot of times I talk about my assaults I have women doubting my claims and questioning the little details. Because apparently believing victims really just means believe women. And when they finally accept it they have to mention how women have it worse. Even though I never implied otherwise. One hilarious thing is that women will tell me that women have it worse, then go on to say that it's not men vs. women, even though they were the only one that implied that at all.

Men face discrimination, and men are raped. The fact that men are mainly the ones doing the discriminating and are the majority of sexual predators does not negate the fact that men face these issues. I don't understand why mentioning these issues that men face brings such immediate and intense anger from women. In a time where women espouse the need for awareness on these issues, I don't understand why awareness for men pisses women off so thoroughly. As if we can't concurrently fight for fairness on both sides. But you mention the majority of suicides are male, or mention all the homeless veterans women are ready to fly off the handle and tell me all about how these problems were created by men so it's our fault and not as valid as what they go through. I've even gotten hate for refusing to use gendered language. I've been asked things like ""do you believe womenshould be believed regarding sexual assault?"" And if I answer that I believe victims should be believed, not women, they rage at me for trying to shoehorn men into their cause.

Also I love how women completely forget intersectionality when it comes to men. Feminists completely understand that Black women have it worse than white women. But for men it's all just one group. A feminist will agree emphatically that Black people face discrimination, yet I can say that I'm a man that faces discrimination and women are up in arms. But I'm a black man so that statement is 100% true??

It's maddening. All I want to do is create more visibility for male victims and I'm met with hate and vitriol in return. It's honestly getting to the point where it's hard to care about women's issues after seeing hope little they care about men's issues. Don't get me wrong, I will always care and will always be an ally. But some days its hard to keep my anger focused on the problematic women and not women in general.

If anyone died, I would not be writing this here. Maybe still not the best story, because people act crazy in such situations, but I mainly want it off my chest.

My hubby and I were driving about five cars behind the accident when it happened. Guy was driving around 180km/h (110mph) on the highway where 110km/h (70mph) was allowed. He raced past us and my husband said something along the lines of ""he is going to get in an accident one day"", and not a second later the guy crashes into someone changing lanes. They spin out of control, crash into another car and hit some more before stopping. 

We are both enjoying a basic medical and advanced first aid training, my hubby though his work at the special forces and me through the Red Cross Emergency Response Team. For that job I always have my uniform in the back of my car. If I get called, I need to be able to hop in and head to an emergency site as quickly as possible. So my gear is ready to go.

We stop, I grab my jacket and the suitcase with my equipment, tell the first few bystanders I pass to call the emergency services. My husband is already moving through the site to check for hazards, like leaking fuel, which wasn't the case thanks to a miracle of the car gods. I was already looking over every casualty to make initial urgency checks. I would be in charge of everyone stopping to help, because I was the only one in uniform until ambulance and police arrive (at which point they get charge), so I had to make sure that I knew who needed treatment. I got approached by a few people who have some form of training, be it a first aid course from work or being a trained nurse. I mainly get them to take the minorly injured behind the guard rails and treat them if possible. 

On to our mother who I want off my chest. Her car was hit on the side, damage to the passenger side door. She seemed shaken but okay, her son appeared to have a broken arm, nothing major. I move on to the next car and spot some signs of neck trauma. Right away he is on the top of my list. I tell hubby what I suspect, and he starts his work to check vitals together with a nurse who had stopped to help. I move on to check on the others, I had two cars left and I didn't want to miss any major casualty. Of those two, only the speeding car has another major injury. I will spare you the details, but it appeared later that something laying around in his car hit him in the head, leaving a crack in his skull. Not good. 

I call one of the people on the phone over and tell everything that I find and do, so he can relay it to the emergency services. At this point, EM comes running to me with eyes the size of a full moon, holding her son and his broken arm.

Mom: ""Miss, you just walked away, my son needs help.""

Me: ""Correct, because this man needs my help more."" I brushed her prescence off. Anyone would be in shock at such moments, so I understood her having her priorities mixed up. 

Mom: ""Yes, but you can't just walk away when seeing my son needs help. You are a doctor (am not, but she thinks me to be one), you are obligated to help""

Me: ""Madam, this man has a way worse injury, can I focus on my work?""

Mom, now with arms firmly in her sides: ""I demand that you help my son, his arm is broken.""

Me: ""And this man can die, please take your son behind the guardrails. I will be with you when the ambulance takes this man from my hands.""

Mom: ""My son could maybe die as well, you don't know without checks."" She starts to pull on my shoulder, which I just try to shrug off as I am currently checking vitals, an interruption would require me to start over and lose time.

Meanwhile the first ambulance had seemingly arrived and they are working on hubby's case. He therefor had joined me and EM, which I had not yet noted due to my focus on my patient, who was getting trouble breathing. 

Hubby: ""Let's take a look at him then,"" and he kneels down in front of the boy, checking his breathing and pulse to get a basic image of his vitals.

Mom mumbles something along the lines of ""finally someone who does something.""

Hubby gets back up and gives the boy a hand. ""You are a brave boy, not even a single tear from you. Lets get behind the guardrails now, that way you will be safe."" He ignores EM and guides the boy to the rest of the patients.

Mom: ""He needs help right away, right? tell this woman.""

Hubby: ""You boy might die...""

Mom: \*audibly scoffs at me\*

Hubby: ""in 80 years or so, maybe longer. For now he is doing good enough to be fine."" 

I would liked to have seen the mom's face at that point, but I was too focussed on the man in front of me, who ended up surviving (and losing his drivers licence). A cop who saw it happen offered me to make a case of it, due to her attempt to obstruct a professional who was working to save a life, but honestly I don't want her to get such a thing in her file. To me, she was just a worried mom who wanted her son some aid. Be it in an entitled way :)

My Dad would have been 66 today. He died of lung cancer in 2017. I think it's my fault he suffered wordlessly for almost three weeks before his death.  


He was admitted to Intensive Care with what his doctor thought was severe pneumonia. My mother had left that morning to visit my out-of-state sister. I went to the hospital to see him. He couldn't even breathe through a sentence. His doctors told me they were going to stick a camera down his throat to assess the damage and that I would have to leave.

The last thing my father said to me as they wheeled the equipment into his room was ""Ask a lot of questions and tell me what they say.""

He went into respiratory duress during the procedure. He was intubated and never spoke again. 

Every time I saw him after that, he had this question on his face, eyebrows raised, expectant stare. I didn't know what he was asking me, so I guessed. I'd say to his nurses ""Oh, he needs his mouth swabbed,"" or ""He wants some ice chips,"" or ""Can you turn him a little?"" or, or, or.

I was alone with him that first week. 

As such, I became the de facto spokesperson for our family, meeting with his team of doctors, getting information and updating everyone on his condition.

My Mom, my sister and I decided not to tell him the severity of his prognosis until we knew for sure what he was up against.  He had a history of half-assing difficult things and we didn't want him to give up too soon (Example: In the 20+ years we owned our family home, he never finished painting it. He started right when we moved in. Picked the main color, trim for the window sashes. He didn't finish the back because ""It's the back. Who cares? No one's gonna see it."" and ""I can't reach the top with the ladder."" He did it twice. Twice, he repainted the front of the house and then was like ""Ehhhh"" once he got to the back.)

He got worse over a couple of weeks and his doctors were reluctant to tell us why he wasn't improving. They had told us he had cancer. They didn't tell us how advanced it was. We transferred him to a better hospital in a major city an hour away.

That's where he died two days later.

I was the one who told him he was dying. 

His new team of doctors had told us what our small-town doctors would not: that he had Stage 4 lung cancer, it had moved to his heart, his organs were shutting down and he was going to die.

An hour before he died, I stood next to his bed and I said:  
""Dad. You know you're very sick, right?""  
He nodded.  
""OK. What you don't know is that you have Stage 4 lung cancer, it has moved to the fluid surrounding your heart, your organs are failing and you are dying. Do you understand what I'm saying to you?  
He nodded.  
""Do you forgive me for having to tell you this?""  
He nodded.  
""Are you tired of all of us standing around your bed, staring at you? Would you like to hear some music?""  
He nodded.

We played some of his favorite songs as he was removed from life support. He died within a few minutes.   


It took me maybe a year or so to connect the dots. 

The last thing he said. ""Ask them a lot of questions and tell me what they say."" The way his face relaxed when I told him he was going to die. The right question finally answered. I've since realized he'd been waiting that whole time. He'd been lying there, mute, but still asking me to tell him what I think he already knew. 

And, I didn't. I didn't tell him.

I bought markers and craft paper and made cheerful signs I hung around his room. I kept meeting with his doctors. I told other people what his doctors thought was happening to him.

I didn't tell him.

He had the span of an hour to come to terms with the end of his life. He had an hour to accept the fact that the rest of us: his wife, his two daughters, and his months-old, first granddaughter would walk out of that place without him and he would never be with us again.

My Mom and my sister talk about his peaceful death. How they were grateful we could all be with him as he left this world. But, they didn't see what I saw. My Mom had laid her head on his left shoulder, my sister was curled up on his right. I was standing at the foot of his bed, my hand on his knee. He wasn't peaceful. He was scared. He tried to breathe. Then, he died.  


I think it's my fault he spent almost three weeks in limbo, unaware of the eventual truth.

I'm holding a family secret that could tear apart an entire family, but it's not mine. It's a relative who confided in me, swore me to secrecy, and has even offered to keep paying for my silence. I've received a few cheques from them so far. I've not cashed any of them, despite numerous phone calls insisting that I do. 

I got a new job that has given me the biggest case of imposter syndrome and it's been 6 months. I'm still dealing with that every single day. I am keeping up, but I feel like a stranger in these walls.

I had an abortion that nobody knows about. I had complications from it too. I had to hide all this. No one knows. Not even my husband. (We are 110% childfree).

My husband has PTSD and work for him has changed to the point that he is having more episodes than usual. He booked appointments to finally see a therapist, but I just found out last night he cancelled them. He keeps asking me to support him, and I have been, but I'm not a therapist. I'm just a wife. I can only help so much within my capacity.

I moved away from all my friends and family, and find myself missing them fiercely, but I don't want to go back either. I just feel so alone.

My job doesn't offer much in the way of social relationships with co-workers. Very corporate. I came from a previous industry of 7 years where I had to work very closely with everyone. Now I sit at my desk, push paper and listen to podcasts secretly to try and fill that human social need.

My health is still crap. I have an unpredictable auto-immune disease. It's in remission right now, but I'm still trying to recover from major nutrient deficiencies.

So many of our friends are going through divorces. Four couples. So we are trying to be there for them, but I can only give so much of my time and headspace.

I'm so burnt out. I'm so secretly stressed. I even asked my husband to get me the number of a therapist through his work (there is a program for it) and he still hasn't. I remind him every day to get it, and he never does. At one point, he asked if I really needed it.

I don't want to help anyone anymore. I'm so tired of helping people. I'm tired of occasionally asking for support myself and getting scoffed at. ""You're so strong. Why do you need a therapist?""

Because I sometimes still struggle with wanting to not be here, and feeling so desperately alone is only making it worse. I get so angry when they ask me to be even stronger. You have no idea how strong I have been up until now.

Call me a loser if you want but to me, being a short man is one of the worst things. And to make matters worse, people will completely trivialize and downplay your struggles. They will laugh it off. I'm a racial minority but I've never once felt that racism could bring me down. However, I've constantly experienced being disadvantaged as a short guy. I would much rather be a tall non-white man than a short white man. 

Not only do we struggle with romance but women don't see us at all in a sexual way. Sure few women might settle with you but it's not because of true desire. You will never get that desire that you give to a woman. We are not even perceived as men. Don't take my word for it, just listen to some of the language women use about us. They talk about us as if we are ""boys"", and not ""real men"". It's hard to shake off that conditioning and of course a lot of men have it too. I mean all our super heroes (batman, superman, etc.) all look like that. A short man is usually the bumbling goofy comedy relief character. It's always abundantly clear that he is of low value, that his position in society is lower.

Just examine how tall men carry themselves. They intrinsically behave with confidence and masculinity. Of course, the ""just be confident bro"" advice that people will throw for this will do nothing for us. A short man can never convince himself of this. It's already been beaten in to his head how undesirable and worthless he is. Even if he tries, it will easily be perceived as insecure and compensatory.

I know that’s uncommon and all, but that’s beside the point. You know why I love mornings? They’re quiet, there’s coffee, the sun is coming up, and again, they’re *quiet.*

This morning, I was hoping for a peaceful start. It’s my last day working for my current company and I go straight into working for my new company tomorrow. I wanted today to get off to a good start so I would feel good about the work I did on my last day and feel motivated for tomorrow. 

But no. I got an awful start to the morning, and my darling, it’s your fault. First, you wake me up yelling about your phone, which I know it’s frustrating that it doesn’t work correctly, but was it worth getting so worked up over? You already knew it was fucked, why get so flustered all over again? You have a plan to buy a new one, so again, why did you feel the need to yell aggressively about your broken phone?

Second of all, you got in a huge hissy fit because I put my jeans and sweater that I wore yesterday in your clean hamper. While technically the jeans and sweater aren’t freshly cleaned, I planned on wearing them again, so they weren’t “dirty.” But you decided to yell at me for it at 7:30am. I apologized and didn’t even explain that they weren’t dirty, I just accepted that I messed up in your eyes and apologized, hoping my lack of confrontation would allow you to cool down. 

It didn’t. You then proceeded to yell “FUCK” very loudly from the other room. I thought you’d hurt yourself and ran in there to see what had happened. You explained your old ass pants had ripped, and I’m thinking, “...that’s it? *That’s* why you yelled ‘FUCK’, probably waking up our roommate much earlier than he wanted to be awake?! They’re just pants.” You complained you were almost ready and it was wildly inconvenient. I understand that, but it’s not any reason to get so fired up. 

Finally, you get ready to leave. You open the door as I’m proceeding to get ready and say, “Bye, babe.” I was pretty pissed, so I just didn’t respond. Then you repeated yourself, so I felt forced to mutter, “Bye, love you.” .

..but wait, there’s more. A few moments later, you bound back into the apartment, obviously looking for something. I ask what you’re looking for so I can help, and you say your keys. You always put your keys in your dish on your bookshelf, but they weren’t there. So you throw my clothes I’d laid on the bed to change into off the bed searching for your keys. The keys you realize a moment later are in your coat pocket. You said, “Oops,” before running off and out the door again. 

And there I was, left with an awful feeling of irritation and a ruined fucking morning. I did nothing to cause it besides the jeans and sweater mistake, yet you decided to involve me in your useless temper tantrums when I didn’t ask to be. 

I went to pour a cup of coffee, and found you didn’t make enough for me to have a cup. I’d planned to leave earlier than usual to grab a bite of breakfast from my favorite joint before work, but that plan was as ruined as my morning since I had to take the time to make my coffee. 

Darling, I love you beyond everything. All your behaviors this morning were uncommon for you overall, though you do tend to get unreasonably upset by little things sometimes. Regardless, I know you don’t normally start your mornings like this and normally I’d let it go, but goddamn, this was an incredibly *important* morning for me today. And tomorrow? Even more important. 

And as much as I love you, I must say this: Fuck you for ruining my morning. One I was planning on being peaceful and smooth turned into one of the worst mornings I’ve had in a long time. If you manage to repeat this type of thing tomorrow, we’re gonna have problems. Especially because I’m planning on approaching this with you (in a much nicer and less rant-y way) after work tonight. So please, for God’s sake, miss me with your drama queen bullshit tomorrow morning.

My brother is a loser burnout who dropped out of high school, refused to get a job and be an adult but he also played a major part in developing my love of video games and I guess that just some part of me cant help but feel like a bit of a loser for playing and spending my money on video games even though I know I'm not.

(Not sure how he was ""brought into it"" considering I didn't discuss it with him and the legal aspects were all well done by then but whatever) Also was told by him after finding out about the outburst, ""We've already forgiven you for your past, now it's time you work on forgiving yourself.""

British influence over Iran casts a long shadow, American Versus Russian influence has reduced the country to rubble, and people are panicking over headlines.

Earlier today I saw a YSK post that said that Persians speak Farsi, not Arabic. Really? Arabs and Persians have been at odds for centuries. That's like mixing up German culture with French culture, ""they're close to each other so they must be the same"".

""We're all Islamic"". Islam has been forced upon the Persians over and over again, and to assume that everyone gladly prays to a God introduced by oppressors is blatantly ignorant.

""It's a desert Iraq 2.0"". No, Iran is not Iraq, far from it. The terrain is not just desert, it features snowy mountains, lakes, and lush forests. Iraq and Iran are two totally seperate nations that feature many differences in language, culture, and religion.

I come from a family that holds strong Pro-Shah feelings, and because of this we have been celebrating the death of the traitorous Soleimani. No r/news, we are not all chanting ""Death to America"", many of us are hopeful of a regime change. No r/worldpolitics, we don't all think that the United States is evil, that honor goes to the Anti-Democratic British.

I don't have money for anything, truthfully, but that's not the point here. I really just need to vent about a problem that appears to be here to stay.


For a tiny taste of the back story :
A couple of years ago, I worked to lose weight which had a side effect of needing new under things. I don't plan on being that size again so I donated and trashed my larger sized items. 

Last year-ish I discovered a lump in my breast, checked in with a primary care doctor who said it wasn't concerning so I've just continued on. No big deal, they said it's common to have fatty growths or something like that. I have more pressing health stuff to deal with so I ignore the lump as best as I can. I can't afford to see my current specialists so I sure don't want to add to the mix. 

The stupid thing just keeps growing. You can see it in the mirror because of it's location and now my right breast is noticeably larger (I guess it just pushed the other fat around instead of kindly absorbing it or whatever) so now it doesn't really fit in my bras. Damn me for throwing out my old ones. 

It's given me goofy problems in every day life. Reaching with that arm is different, shoulder stretches I've done for years don't work the same. I even have to be mindful of my clothes because my cleavage is wonky in my half-too-small bras. Luckily I gave up dating years ago because this shit would be ridiculous to explain. 

It feels silly to complain about but I have no one to talk to about it so the frustration builds. Family is always sure I'm dying when I mention health related things and I have exactly zero female friends here to turn to. 

As I said before, I just needed somewhere to vent into the void. I'm beyond glad that places like this exist for people like me who don't have other outlets.

Sometimes she'd make playful comments which could come off as flirty, but it never really turned into anything more than that. She's always kept in touch with me though, be it out of the blue, or just maintained conversation for days straight.

I still talk to her and hang out with her, and there have been times where I sort of push my feelings down and I don't let that urge come up. She's had boyfriends, I've had girlfriends, she's moved in and out of state, and we still kept in touch and hung out during those times. She's confided in me about her sexuality (it's complicated and she doesn't know where she lies on the spectrum right now, and she's talking to a girl who lives overseas).

I know they care. I know it’s just because it’s for my health, but I can’t stand it sometimes, especially when they make me feel as if I’m not even trying. It’s hard to take their words to heart because the average person has zero idea what it’s like to only be able to intake 1 kg (~34oz) of any type of fluid a day and keep track of sodium intake. Too much of the latter makes you even more thirsty. I recommend to try and measure just how much you drink in a day to understand what I mean.

To be frank, I have kidney disease and am now on dialysis, and large sodium intake is what got me here. I’m always thirsty. Always always always. One glance at a drink and it makes me want to drink something so bad. I have decidedly skipped meals just because it would allow me to drink less, and I’m thinking of skipping more until I can find a good way to balance cooking my own meals. Basically, since the kidneys are close to non-function, my body can’t release much fluid if at all, and too much fluid creates more work for the heart, and can cause irreversible damage.

You wouldn’t believe the amount of sodium in a takeout dish. A single dish in a chain restaurant can hold about 2100mg of sodium or more, and that’s a bigger amount than what is recommended daily for a 2000 calorie diet. Restaurants always tout low calorie meals, but they’re always between 1500mg-2000+mg. There are almost no low-sodium options anywhere unless you get a salad or portion your meal..and my diet calls for 1500mg maximum a day. I basically have a dire need to cook my own meals, and this is coming from a person who did take-out a lot and grew up with high-sodium home meals.

I was so frustrated when I was first hit with sodium restrictions a couple years ago and my family kept harping on about it while eating barbecue and all my favorite foods I grew up with in my face. I am fully aware diet is my responsibility but I felt like I got no support, only unsolicited scoldings which made me want to just eat whatever I wanted even more because any effort on my part went unnoticed or was diminished. I felt alone and depressed after high school, but after my diagnosis, I felt even more alone than I thought was possible.

The doctors told me a year ago when my condition escalated that I could have eventually died if I kept going without seeing the doctor and I wished for the majority of the past few years that I did. I don’t feel that way now that I’ve adjusted somewhat..but it’s still hard to juggle food and fluid between work and dialysis.

All I can think of all the time is that I wish I could have a full 16.9oz cup of an iced drink in one sitting..not this stupid 8oz cup that I can only drink four of in an entire day...it’s literally two gulps for me. I was one of those types that could garner 4-5 refills in one sitting. I used to drink smoothies or sodas or juice in place of eating because I liked drinking things better. Now I’m basically not allowed to even consume a full drink...

TL;DR Don’t make someone feel bad for struggling with their dietary restrictions if they’re putting in some kind of effort to make it work...it’s basically an entire lifestyle change. Support rather than scold...that’s all. Just had to get that off my chest..",True,False,[],False,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,464588,public,self,I don’t like when people get on my case about my dietary restrictions when they don’t know at all what it’s like to suddenly have to completely upturn that part of your life.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/ek96jk/i_dont_like_when_people_get_on_my_case_about_my/,no_ads,0.0

So I’m post college, a year and a half into my job, messy financial situation between my family and myself. Don’t have any savings and I know I have to be better about this tbh. It’s a 2020 resolution of mine. 

Knowing how hard it is I still give so much money away to my family and people who need it. I grew up first generation with a lot of siblings and food stamps and had my childhood home taken away from us cause my parents were and still are struggling financially. So safe to say I’ve always been in a survivor flight mode even now trying to help my family get out of that situation. It’s been such a stressful situation to where I have basically given up on my parents ever being financial responsible. But as a Christian I truly believe God provides and has kept me and my family a float this long. We’re truly blessed anyway. I’ve learned that this is just my family and we do what we can with what we have. I hope one day we win the lottery and just are able to feel stable but this is just life. 

Anyway, around where I work there a bunch of homeless people and I try to give them what I have but I rarely carry singles or 20s in general. Sometimes and only maybe once or twice every month or two I carry a couple hundred when someone pays me something back and I haven’t deposited it or put it my small piggy bank. And again because I feel this is God speaking in my heart (just go with it) I have this sudden ok I’m giving this homeless person the $100 in my bag right now. 

And honestly I know I am struggling but the joy of the faces when they realize it’s $100 makes my day and my life. 

One day I was extremely stressed and sad and just feeling honestly hopeless cause it was just a bad day. I was on my way to my therapist app at the stoplight before the building. I just had another calling to give this guy the only $100 I had in my bag. I gave it to him after the light turned green and i was holding traffic. In my rear view mirror I saw him literally jump for joy. It was like fists up him looking back at me and waving his sign back at me with the biggest smile on his face. It just put me in tears it was a sight I’ll never forget. I was having such a bad day but seeing him just made me realize like there are still good things. 

This happened again New Years Eve where i was waiting at a stoplight on my way to go buy myself more clothes and again got the “give him the $100 now gut feeling”. I say “Jesus Loves you” The fellow’s response was just so... heartwarming. 

I wish I could do more. I wish I could help everyone. I don’t tell people, especially my family, that I do this because I’m afraid they will say something like we could’ve used that or something. And it’s true but It’s just me and what I can do. I wanted to get it off my chest. I just feel so good doing it. It makes me happy. I don’t know how good or bad this sounds. It’s just something I wanted to say. 


Thank you.

I've never had a dad, I met him once when I was 3 and no contact ever since. His loss, because I think I'm pretty fucking awesome. Either way, that isn't what the story is about now is it? This boyfriend of hers was pretty decent. She'd known him many years prior and had been friends and all, but then he got married. And divorced. And remarried and had two kids. They were never a thing until two or so years ago, when he revealed he was leaving his wife and professed his undying love for her or whatever else. I never knew about the guy but within 6 months we were packed up and moved from the only place I had called home for a little under 14 years.

&amp;#x200B;

That was fine with me, though, cause I didn't like my school and thought I could be the 'cool new girl'. Didn't happen. These two sons of this dude are two grades above me, however they didn't know about me for I wanna say.. 7 or 8 months? Because it 'might upset the boys' if he told them. Oh no, the poor fragile boys might just drop dead knowing their father had a girlfriend who had a kid. I didn't care, didn't really say anything about it. Finally they knew of me, along with his wife, and then everyone was mad. Whatever, I just went along with it. Go with the flow. We went to trivia a few times with one of his kids. We aren't friends by any means but we don't hate each other. The other still glares at me in the hallways but I don't care because they're leaving the school in a year and what's he gonna do? Beat me up?

&amp;#x200B;

But, the story gets more interesting. This dude gave up custody of his kids, because he didn't want to fight for them. That's shit. Really shit. My dad did the same with me, and goddamn, never even knew the dude but that stings a bit. So I can only imagine what his kids feel. He also did this, while still married to their mother. What a stand up guy. At least he let them live in his house still, busting his ass working only 14 hours a week and making over 6k a month for the mortgage. Don't ask me how he does it, my theory is drugs but my mother says he has an actual job. I never really paid attention to whatever it was.

&amp;#x200B;

So of course the kids are angry, and my mother is upset with him now too. Because he still won't divorce his goddamn wife even though they've been separated about a year or so now. (For time line, this was about a year ago. Not current day.) They start breaking up, then back together, then breaking up. And my god if they aren't like a high school couple then I don't know what they are because they sure as hell aren't functioning adults at this point. This man keeps getting back together with my mother, mostly because he doesn't want to rent an apartment to live in. He lives with us instead, and walks around in his underwear half the time and leaves half empty drinks all over the place. I express to my mother my distaste for this man and how he is treating us like a hotel. She agrees. They break up. A week later? Back together again.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all this, my mother has a stroke. A minor one, she recovered fully and is absolutely fine now. They run in my family. But this fucker can't even stay in the hospital with her for one fucking night knowing how fearful she is of being in the hospital. But it's fine. They break up, she comes home, they get back together.

This cycle repeats. He is still married to his wife as of October 2019, and I tell my mother about my internet best friend and that I want to meet him. She agrees, I meet him, it's amazing and I ball my eyes out on the way home. My mother gets home and is sitting in her room on the phone with him, he complains about how he can't see out of his left eye. She had the same thing happen to her when she had her stroke, so she tells him she's going to come over to his office. He insists she shouldn't. She does anyway. Long story short he had a minor stroke, and was out of the hospital in two or so days. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, the day after he leaves the hospital he calls my mother. All my mother hears over the phone is groaning. She rushes from the house, it's about 7 am and we were going to leave so she could drop me off at school but this is more important. I didn't know what was going on and didn't care, woo, no school. Turns out he had a massive stroke, lost feeling in his left arm and leg, and is not going to make it. Except he does! Woo! My mom is a mess, I comfort her despite the feeling that maybe if he had died it would've been better. I know, I'm horrible. Don't remind me. He's still married, his wife has legal control. Bars my mom from the hospital and tries to sign a DNR. I'll admit, his wife is shit, which is why I think they are a perfect match for each other but he doesn't think so I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother busts her ass, making sure his children know what happened to their father despite them being so horrible to her, contacting his brother so that he can get a power of attorney signed and set up proper medical stuff, and driving an hour a day back and forth to the rehab center to take care of him for over two months. I have no idea why she would do this, I guess because she is in love with a man who I can tell doesn't love her back. 

&amp;#x200B;

She takes over as his caretaker, wiping his ass and changing his diapers when he comes home. And he can't even call her by the right name. He calls her by his wife's name. She gives this man everything and in return he sits on the couch itching his balls and asking for another beer. He isn't trying to get better, won't work on his leg even though they think he could use it again, and my mother just keeps trying. 

&amp;#x200B;

No amount of me trying to talk her out of it or help her will get through to her, she feels like she has to do this. She really doesn't. Not in my eyes. Because this man has lied to her, cornered her in the room of her bedroom until I, a very small 16 year old, had to intervene and tell him to get the fuck out, refused to give her financial help (even though he freeloads off our home, paying no rent or anything else and living there most nights of the week), and refused to even divorce his wife for her. Why? Because it might 'upset the boys'. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight it really hit me why he wouldn't marry her. My mother has his phone, and she was looking through his voicemail for things he might have missed and playing them for him so he could tell her what to respond with. One starts.  


""Hey babe, you haven't been answering my calls and I really want to know what's up? Please call me back, we can work this out.""  


There's more than one. There's a bunch. Four women, from what I overheard. Four women this man has been cheating on my mother with. I can't say I'm surprised, because he did cheat on his wife with my mother. I told my mother it was a red flag. She didn't listen.   


She's absolutely distraught.

Sorry for the long post. 

Just as the title states. My parents have been divorced for almost 5 years. After some indifidelity and personal differences they split after almost 27 years together. While my mother and I have always had a strained relationship, I've always been close to my dad. Even tho the divorce was mostly his doing, I still stood by him and supported him. 3 years ago we went on vacation together and he informed me that he was dating someone. I was happy for him as I only want what's best for my parents and truly want them both to be happy. A few months ago, however, I found out that his girlfriend is younger than I am. While this shocked me, I still decided that I wanted to support him and stay close. I went home for the holidays and spent time at his place with my brothers (17M &amp; 28M) and his girlfriend (22F). It was all fine (even tho them kissing and being flirty grossed me out) and I still decided to support them. Until a few days ago when I got home my dad texted me telling me that they had broken up. I felt sad for him as I have seen him the happiest he has ever been these past few years with this new woman. I texted him and told him that I would be here to talk if he needed me. Flash forward to today when my little brother calls me in a panic and tells me he is on the way to pick up our dad from the police station. He tells me that our dad's girlfriend called him and told him that while she was at his place picking up some things to move out, our dad came home and became angry. She says that he choked her and threw her to the ground. She called the police and my dad was arrested. I don't for a second think that she is lying, but my dad has never been violent before. I am so distaught and cannot even find the words to talk about this with anyone around me. I guess I just needed to word vomit all of this somewhere. I'm not really looking for advice, just somewhere to dump all of this and feel heard. I'm not sure where to go from here and what to do.

This past year we have grown so distant - she started a new STEM program in college and I changed career fields. We grew distant to the point that we became like roommates. I neglected her emotional needs, I let our house get so cluttered and messy, she neglected some of my needs, and it got to the point where she felt so empty that she stepped out and developed an emotional connection with another man from work and ended up making out with him at a bar. I understand something was lacking at home and he obviously provided her something I wasn't. I do not think that this was specific to him, it could have been anyone who gave that attention. He was in our fucking house at a party she threw on New Years Eve while I was couch surfing due to separation. I thought space would do us good, and when I left I didn't know about the cheating yet. She was texting him all throughout Christmas and my birthday and New Years, even while I ended up in the hospital due to my own neglect of a medical issue. I had already suspected something but trusted her because she never did anything like this at all. I found out because we live in a medium sized town and someone took pictures of them at the bar and phone records and stuff. When confronted, she didn't deny it and genuinely did seem apologetic and answered all of my questions. 

I feel so fucking lost. She wants the divorce and my stupid ass still wants to go to counseling and work through this. I envisioned us having kids, I envisioned us growing old with one another. I had this entire vision figured out for my life and I was so focused on that, that I refused to put the work in and be the best husband I could be. I promised I would take steps to improve my mental health, never did it. I promised I would start exercising, nope. I skipped out on bills sometimes because I knew she had savings. But damn, I dont deserve to be cheated on. Marraige problems are just problems. She insists that the cheating was terrible and she is sorry for it, but it doesn't change the fact that our issues were not fixable in her opinion.

Just need someone to vent to because my boyfriend just doesn't get why im so upset and tbh I'm not totally getting the crying either. 

2 years ago I'd just got my ears repierced, I was at a party and a guy unprovoked grabbed my head and ripped my ear nearly in half pulling my piercing down with his teeth, I had to get my lobe stitched back together but luckily my piercing had wrapped around the last milimetre of my skin and kept it from being completely torn in half. The guy in question got off with a warning as he seemed ""really sorry"". I was constantly harassed (had my house egged on his behalf every other night) after he was moved to different accomodation (he was my neighbour) he remained student rep for his course and essentially moved to better accomodation only having to pay rent of the shitty accomodation we were living in (he was my neighbour) for his trouble, I couldn't cope with the university trying to blame me for being at the party with him when in actual fact I actually did nothing wrong, in my exams he has the same first letter in his surname as me so was the table next to me, I felt like I couldn't get away from him and his lackeys so dropped out.

Two of them had never seen it before; I lost count how many times I have seen it. We were watching Season 1 when one of the friends remarked how racist and offensive Hank is. I agreed with them but didn’t comment anything further because I know Hank develops throughout the show and becomes more mature and less abrasive. I didn’t want to spoil anything. 

At the end of Season 1, the friend who made that remark said they no longer had any interest in finishing the show. I asked them why? Because Hank makes her uncomfortable, due to his racism and offensive remarks. I tried desperately to tell her that his character starts out that way but goes through stuff that changes him and makes him less offensive. “Doesn’t change the fact that he’s a racist POS”, she said. 

Like yes, he started out that way, and may not be everyone’s favorite in the first two and a half seasons, but that’s what makes the show so good. You start out rooting for one character and hating another, but the characters change for the better or worse. 

“I refuse to watch a show that glorifies racism against Hispanics or other marginalized groups.” 

That’s the least of the show’s problems (not really problems, just subject matter that is troubling...such as drug use and addiction...)

So that friend no longer wants to watch the show. One of the best shows in television history. All because one character is racist in the very beginning. No considering for the idea of growth and change. No consideration for character development. I’m not one to say “SJWs RUIN EVERYTHING” because I believe those people have some valid points. It’s just disappointing because this shows me that people refuse to acknowledge change and growth in real life people. Fictional characters are meant to show development in dramatic ways (Hank becoming more humble; Walt becoming more egotistical and arrogant). If I stopped watching Avatar: The Last Airbender because I thought Zuko was a one-dimensional villain just by seeing the very first episode, I’d miss insanely good character development. Hank’s CD wasn’t as good, but it’s still noticeable as the show goes on. 

It’s also disappointing because I once had my own arc. My family is racist and offensive. They use every word known that is offensive to every known group. For the first 15 years of my life, I thought it was ok until stuff happened that made me see the real world and realize nothing my family says is ok. What if that friend saw me and my family for one day back then and tell me now that I am incapable of change because of who I used to be? I’d be upset because I am no longer that person. I no longer agree with my family’s views. 

Still. It’s their call. Their prerogative. I get they have a point in Hank being racist, but that shouldn’t mean they stop watching the show for that reason and that reason only.",True,False,[],False,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,464512,public,self,Sometimes the “SJW” thing people talk about is real and it gets exhausting.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/ek5291/sometimes_the_sjw_thing_people_talk_about_is_real/,no_ads,0.0

But the truth is, I wouldn’t change a single thing about my life.

I’m 30 and married (going on 8 years) with a two-year-old girl and one very old, very sweet dog. We live in a suburb in Utah, and we were lucky to get a house as nice as we did. (In the home shopping process, it was my favorite one we had seen! I was afraid someone else would get it!) 

My husband is an accountant for a smaller property management company. He likes the people he works with well enough, the commute isn’t terrible. Sometimes we get to be treated to nice dinners and small vacations, since some of the properties they own are hotels. He was able to get a new car a few months ago, nothing super fancy, but compared to the old Ford Focus he used to drive, a Chevy Volt is a nice upgrade!

Our daughter is amazing! She isn’t the easiest kid to take care of, but only because she’s so smart and curious. She loves playing with us, and our dog. She’s bright and talkative, and most people assume she’s a year or two older just because of how many words she can say. She learns new things every day, and it’s impossible not to be charmed by her. She’s very busy, but it just inspires me to find fun things for us to do every day.

Our dog was honestly a lucky chance. A friend’s mother had him his whole life, and then moved to a housing complex that didn’t allow pets. We decided to take him in, and I’m glad we did! He’s a small poodle-Pomeranian mix. He doesn’t shed, bark, or have accidents in the house. His favorite thing is a good cuddle and a snack! (He’s sleeping on my lap, even now!)

As for me, I’m a full-time mom, and I also work part-time at an event center, mainly taking photos of events. It gets me out of the house a few nights a month, but not so much that I feel terribly guilty being away from our baby girl. My coworkers are all great, and because there’s only seven of us, we’re pretty tightly knit. 

The truth is, the older I get, the more I appreciate the little things. Whenever I start to wonder about having a nicer house, living in a fancier town, or having lots of expensive stuff, I have to stop and think: would any of that really make me happier? I’m grateful for what we have, I guess. There are so many things that could be worse. I have a good relationship with my parents and siblings, and my in-laws have always been wonderful to me, and love our baby girl! (And our dog, too!)

- Think about the number of women-only clothes stores there are and compare it to men-only clothes stores
- There are an enormous amount of different clothes made for women compared to the few ones for men.
- The less clothing for men means less male models. That’s why the grand majority of models are female
- Makeup is made for female skin. The only male makeup users are makeup artists
- Male clothes are either bland or expensive

I am an idiot! Glad we are on the same page.

I met this woman through Facebook 4 years ago, we became close friends shortly after. I knew she was married and she told me about it many times. She would always tell me about how horrible her marriage was, how she wanted to leave because it was impossible to fix it. This of course got my hopes up.

Almost 2 years of being flirtatious friends I asked her out and she said yes, still being married.

Her husband, from what I was always told was honestly just shitty. He would drink so much and get verbally violent with her, gaslighting her and more. He rarely lets her on her phone or any other device. But he would sit on his computer all day playing games or watching the news.

Fast foward, our relationship was honestly amazing! Despite not being able to talk as much as we would like since her phone time was limited. But last October she asked ""What if I dont leave my husband?"". The question caught me off guard since all I have heard before it was that she wanted to leave him, not even necessarily for *me*. It really shattered me, yes again I know its my fault, shes married! Our relationship became pretty rocky after that.

She started to tell me good things about her husband and how he ""isn't always bad"". She told me that she feels like she owes it to her marriage to not just give up, even though she's been with him for like 15 years or something and it's always been pretty bad. She told me she needs therapy to help her figure it out..

I've started to just give up recently and tell her to fix her marriage so at least she can be happy. But again, her husband doesn't do therapy or cares to listen to much of what she has to say about it. The man has serious issues but refuses to work on them. I've also started to ask her almost everyday ""do you want to stay with him?"" anytime she has a bad day with him its a ""no"" but if the day isnt that bad its ""yes"".


God I am such a fucking idiot getting myself into this mess. I want to not give up and try to help her truly figure out what *she* wants rather than what she thinks she wants or what others want from her.

When I was 14, I went to a “bush doof” and tried “party drugs” for the first time. They didn’t sit well with me. I was young, stupid and inexperienced in the world. A man (probably 18yrs) took my hand and led me into the bushes. There he had sex with me while I was unable to move. He left after he had finished. Another man (same age) found me still lying in the bushes maybe half an hour later, paralysed from the drugs and the experience. He pushed a pill down the back of my throat and had his way with me. At the time, I was high on drugs, confused and it was one of my first sexual experiences - pretty much the first really sexual experience. After he left I pulled up my pants and felt extremely odd. I was high on drugs but also somewhat traumatised. 

I didn’t tell anyone what happened. When people asked I just said I’d had sex with some people and swallowed my emotions when I started being called a slut. Only one girl seemed to want to question me about it but she was a girl who had been cruel to me in primary school, so I brushed her off. It wasn’t until the following year that I told someone (my high school sweetheart of the time). It was still very raw and I lied about it to make myself feel better about what happened. I told him I was “gang raped” by 2 men at night when I was minding my own business walking through a park near my home. I changed the story from being fucked on drugs and dragged into a bush to minding my own business and being ambushed in a park near my home. 
I’ve told some other people this made up version but never the real one. I’ve not brought it up with a psychologist because I’m scared that I’ll turn it into a fabricated version of events again. Maybe I’m too scared to face reality? Or maybe I’m just a lying, exaggerating piece of shit who misinterpreted what even happened in those bushes (I mean, drugs don’t help). I’m 27 and I still can’t work this out, I feel terrible about myself all the time, either as a sack of meat for those men or for lying about it. What do I do to move on from this?

I've been on disability since 2009/2010 and as the years have gone by my symptoms have gotten worse. All of my symptoms are ortho static meaning they only happen when I am upright. For the past few weeks I've had weakness in my legs so I can't walk much. It takes around 10 hours of lying down/being asleep for my symptoms to be gone or to have any period of normalcy that very shortly is ended when my head is higher up than my spine ie sitting upright.

I have migraines or sudden pain behind my eyes every other day, constant fatigue/nausea, I can't balance well, I have a stiff neck, back pain, and literally deafening tinnitus that requires me to be on sedatives in order to sleep. It depresses me when I wake up and all my symptoms are gone, or 99% gone, only for them to all come back as soon as I get up. There's this increasing sense of dread the longer I'm up, as my symptoms will be debilitating by the time it's time for bed. Also, as I've aged, it takes longer and longer lying down for my symptoms to fully go away. Before, it used to be an hour, now, 10 years later it's 9-10 hours. High doses of caffeine helps around 20%, but I have a history of seizures, so it's a risk.

I bought myself a gaming PC (complete with an RTX 2080 Ti) and I've been playing my favorite games on it, since my old laptop couldn't. Currently I am playing Breath of the Wild again, I enjoy playing it because I feel it lets me go into another world where I can do things, do little errands or jobs for other characters, go to places, etc. stuff I want to do IRL but can't because of my disability. The character I play as isn't too fatigued to go up a flight of stairs and I can do whatever I want, I find it really therapeutic form of escapism and it helps distract me from my symptoms. Whenever I'm feeling depressed or hopeless I go back into my little game world where I'm playing as someone else.

It sounds silly but it's a dream of mine to be like I was pre 2010, not being on dozens of medications to control my symptoms to little extent, to get a job and meet people. Social media helps me to an extent but it isn't the same as when I was in school and would look forward to going somewhere every day. Sometimes I've had dreams where I've had certain parts of my brain removed just so I could be semi-normal again.

I'm seeing my doctor again on the 8th and I'm going to request I see a neurologist since I have two birth defects related to my spine, and I haven't had an MRI of either since at least 7 years ago.

Anyway. I don't even know how to start this. I'm all over the place and just want to get this out.

I (25m) have been dating my gf (20f) for just over 6 months now. We both deal with anxiety, depression, etc. She's currently on her way to Australia for 2 weeks with her room mate, and it's making me resentful. 

There's no good way to explain the reasons why, and I know im an asshole in this situation. I keep telling myself that, and that's obviously making me feel worse. When we met she said she was doing this and I knew if we ended up together it might be an issue for me. I just didn't expect to feel this bad. 

I left my job Aug 28. I haven't been doing much since then. The last few weeks I've volunteered where she works (an animal sanctuary). Its made me feel pretty good about life and myself, but she lives kind of far away, as is the sanctuary. So it's not like I can just go everyday and do that to keep my mind busy. I'm just sitting alone in my room, doing nothing, making myself upset.

We're from upstate NY. She's been to Ireland, across Europe, California, various other states. I've been to Canada once for 2 nights. I have never gotten the opportunity to travel because my family has always been poor. Her family is pretty well-off. When she talks about having travelled, it feels like she's throwing her family's wealth in my face, even though I know she doesn't mean to and doesn't realize it at all. 

I've never expected to be able to travel, but always told myself I want to, and if there's one place I want to go, it's Australia. See the great barrier reef. Ya know, have some shrimp on the barbie and all that. None of my friends or family care for travelling or are wealthy enough to do so. So the fact that I finally found someone willing to do it with me, and she's going to do it without me is genuinely making me feel terrible. We were by her family for Christmas and her entire family kept talking about, saying ""it's a once in a lifetime trip"" over and over and over. It really stung sitting there knowing I won't get that chance and she's going there.

They're going skydiving. Over the great barrier reef. Again, I've always wanted to sky dive but could never find anyone interested in doing so. And they're going over the great barrier reef. I can't imagine doing anything more fun than that.  If there was one thing I could do before I die, it's that. And she's going to do it without me. 

She said we could go at some point in the future. But I wouldn't want to do that. Its not enjoyable for me to experience something new with someone that has already experienced it. Watching a movie for the first time with someone that has already seen it is a terrible experience for me. Idk why, but that's the way my brain works. So even if we did go. Even if we went sky diving somewhere else. It just wouldn't be the same experience, so it's completely ruined for me.

I want to be able to tell her to talk to me about she's doing. About all the excitement and activities and what the experiences are like. About how much fun she's having. But I know how much it'll suck to hear as I'm just sitting here alone. 

I sort of talked about this once with her. I didn't tell her all of this. I just said it sucks for me, mentioning the ""finally found someone to do stuff with, won't be the same if we do anything because she'll already have experienced it"" bit, and then quickly moved away from the conversation. How am I supposed to say any of this? I know it doesn't make much sense, and is a terrible way to be.

I expected it to be difficult. I didn't expect to feel quite like this. To feel just straight... Bad. I can honestly say this is some of the worst I have ever felt in my life, and I have a history of self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

Its sheer jealousy. Its loneliness. Its anger at myself for being the way I am. Its hating myself that I can't be happy for her and be supportive and excited. Its being upset that she used every single vacation day she has this year, meaning we can do literally nothing this year. 

And it's not like this is a one time thing. Next year she is going to Africa to visit some family for a week and a half. Meaning the same thing will be happening then. Granted, I've never cared to go there and it's not like they'll be going skydiving. Maybe they will, idk I guess. But I'll still just be sitting here. Alone. Jealous and hating myself for feeling like this. 

I love this girl and we are really good together. I've never been happier than when I'm with her. But I can't help but feel like I should break up with her. Not because I'm mad at her. Not because she's done something to deserve getting broken up with. But because she genuinely deserves better. 

She doesn't deserve to have a shitty boyfriend that isn't asking if she's having fun. She doesn't deserve to have to be wondering if our relationship will survive a vacation. She doesn't deserve to have my petty, pathetic ass dragging her down when she should be having the time of her life. I was going to wait until she's back from vacation and tell her I don't know if we're going to work out. That I don't think I can take feeling this way, and feeling this way next year and whenever after because it is genuinely awful. That she deserves someone who is supportive and happy for her instead of being an asshole like I currently am. 

But she messaged me from the plane earlier asking if I'm okay. If we are okay. I didn't really give an answer. I don't want to weigh her down with all this. I want her to go have fun. I want her to be happy. She deserves to be happy. But I know she feels like something is wrong and I don't know how to respond. I am whole heartedly against lying, so pretending like everything is okay doesn't really work for me. What am I supposed to do, sit here suffering for weeks, and then when she gets back say ""oh yeah btw, I've been meaning to break up for a few weeks.""? But I can't say all this and ruin her vacation. Although it feels like I already am, and she's only just sitting in a plane. I feel like no matter what I do I'll be ruining her vacation, her travelling experience, and our relationship.

To top it all off, her birthday is in a week. She should be happy and excited. And I feel like I'm just ruining that too.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say. There's nothing that can make this situation better. I feel awful. Both being upset, and like a terrible person and even worse boyfriend.

We were in a school club together and had a lot of similar interests, so we became pretty close. As a woman who struggles making friends with a lot of other women, her friendship has always been really important to me.

After graduating college almost 4 years ago, I became pretty career-focused out of necessity. My parents love me and are super supportive, but they didn’t pay for college or living expenses after I was 18. I appreciate this because it’s made me more independent and ambitious, but I do have to be careful about my budget since I’m still paying off a lot of debt and the job market is tough.

My friend on the other hand, is still working on her Bachelors degree. Her parents pay for this and just about everything she does. She does work part-time for extra cash, but they still pay her credit card bill at the end of the month. She doesn’t live lavishly, and certainly doesn’t flaunt her (parent’s) wealth, but since I’m her close friend I’m aware of how much this affects her life.

What I mean is, I get really freaking envious. For instance, she and I both struggle with anxiety and depression. Since she’s still in school, she can get free counseling through the college and even if she didn’t, her parents would help her pay. I think I would really benefit from seeing a therapist, but there’s just no way for me to afford it. So when she talks about going to therapy/counseling, I get super envious and start having really passive-aggressive thoughts like “wow, must be nice!”. 

Sometimes I think I let it slip out and she might feel kind of guilty, but idk. I talk to her about my problems because she’s my friend, but sometimes it’s like I’m just trying to make her feel bad for me because she has it so easy. When she talks about her problems I find myself thinking “yeah, but at least you’re not stressed about a job or money!” 

I also kind of judge her for not finishing school yet, for not working for her own money, and for being kind of lazy. I think this has a lot to do with the different values our parents taught us growing up.

I don’t want judge her or to feel this way. I’m not mad that she’s taking advantage of the blessings life has given her, and in her situation I would probably do the same. I just can’t get past this envy and resentment to enjoy our friendship like I used to. At times I’ve thought about telling her we should stop hanging out because I’m such a bad friend.

Ever since then I have had terrible social anxiety. In middle school and high school I did my best to isolate myself to avoid any social contact. I would try to sit alone at lunch, and typically wouldn’t speak to anyone unless I had some group project. I did not have any friends and spent all of my free time playing video games. With a few exceptions I couldn’t make friends online either as I was too conscious about my weird voice + accent to talk to anyone online. I was also always the youngest one as I started school early and got to skip a grade when I moved to US.

When I went to college things got slightly better,  I built up enough courage to be able to hold short conversations although I couldn’t do humor or actually make friends. That said I completely missed the college experience; I never went to a party, never had a girlfriend, never hung out with friends, and never had anyone to text. My social life being non existent I focused on studying and did really well; had great gpa, started a club, did two research projects, won awards, and graduated in only 3 years.

I am now 20 working in a lab until I hopefully get into a medical school. My co-workers are all much older and are more colleagues than friends. Weekends are the worst as I just sit in my apartment waiting for time to pass (family too far away to visit). Basically I’m more isolated than ever.

I recently visited my parents for New Years and they had guests. I saw how they were sharing fun stories from their youth, and I realized that I literally had nothing and never would have any stories from my school or college days.

I absolutely hate the fact that I never get any text notifications on my phone, or how I can’t keep eye contact in a conversation, or how the first impression I make on people is “awkward”, or how basic social interactions like paying for the groceries leaves me with a racing heartbeat, or how I still have a strong accent even though I moved here as a little kid.

I think I have potential, I’m somewhat smart, I’m somewhat attractive, I lead a physically active lifestyle, but literally all of it has no point if I don’t change in the future.

One friend of mine got out of a relationship and since then his whole personality has become searching for a new one and complaining that girls don’t like him. I have a hard time feeling bad for him because I went through this in middle school and high school and have since moved on past caring about that (I’m 23, by the way.) Another friend of mine seems to lose all perspective when he enters a relationship, and he begins to blend in with this person as soon as it begins. He doesn’t pay attention when anyone else is around when he’s with her and everything becomes about her. It is annoying and embarrassing, honestly. My mother, who has found a hobby and new friends in recent years, has entered a relationship and somewhat abandoned those new friends claiming that people stop seeing their friends when they get in relationships in order to progress that relationship. So friends are just a stand in to you until you can depend on and latch onto a man? That is so gross to me. And she skirts over things about his personality that anyone would find troubling. He’s an absolute douchebag to my sister and I when we’re around, flaunting all the fantastic stuff he’s done in his life (all my moms boyfriends have been like this) and he is also racist from what I have heard. But she claims that because he doesn’t try and change her that she doesn’t try and change him.  My best friend is in a relationship with a girl who I’m definitely cool with but it seems as though he’s emotionally manipulated to stay. This girl has major emotional issues and has latched onto him for dear life. She cries the minute she gets to her car saying she misses him. She told him she loves him 2 days into the relationship. Since he has begun dating I have noticed a major shift in his personality as he has become more and more depressed. He lacks the drive to do much of anything anymore and it feels like sometimes I’m losing a best friend. I have sworn to not be like these people. I used to see myself as a dependent and a lesser in my relationship but I snapped myself out of it and woke up. I try to maintain the balance as much as possible, and my girlfriend knows this and is in the understanding of this stance. The fact that you can tell these people these things and they will not acknowledge them or change is absolutely troubling and annoying and it makes me hate seeing love and relationships.

I have a job that pays me 41k, and I’m only 20. That’s a lot of money for someone my age with just a 600$ rent to pay. Money is nice, but I can’t remember the last time I was able to breathe and not be dead after work. I’m seeing my friends more now, doing what makes me happy! And I lost so many of my younger years because I’ve been working since I was 17 but to provide a roof over my head. I noticed people my age had a hard time relating to me. Not to an awkward level, but just because I wasn’t in the same walk of life as them. Everyone around me was having fun. Working on the side, and going to school to chase their careers. While I came home everyday from a job I hate, to just sit on the couch and be bored? 

I went hiking for the first time yesterday in forever and it was so different to have a little time to breathe and do what I want. I’m going to school for nursing now, and I couldn’t be happier. I’m quitting this job after I save just a little more, and then I’ll get a part time just to cover living. And I’m going to be free for the first time since I started working. I can’t wait for the first night I get to go to Starbucks to study and write a paper. I’ve been dreaming of having a bit more normal of a life forever now. And it’s finally time. This has been a struggle with myself and I’m crying as I right this. But it’s from the relief. I’m going to do what I want with my life, do things when I’m ready. I’m ready to go out and be my age. Not the 45 year old life I’ve been living.

Curious as to why that was even a thing so I looked online.

What. The. Fuck.

A bag of pre cut onions is $3 for the equivalent of 1 singular onion. One singular onion is about 20c. How fucking rich do you need to be to pay an entire $2.80 extra for the same amount of onion to save you about 30 seconds of cutting. I understand if people don't want to cry or maybe have many onions to cut but my god this was still 1 onion worth of slices. You can wash it, plug your nose, wear goggles idk but I could not imagine paying that much extra FOR ONE ONION BAG.

She had a nice house, she had nice furniture and decorations but literally none of that mattered because if she really wanted to show off her wealth this was all she needed to do. This was showing me her day to day life that SHE WOULD RATHER PAY 15x EXTRA THE AMOUNT THAN JUST PICK UP A KNIFE AND START CHOPPING FOR 20 CENTS.

I can't believe people live like this. I know I'm crazy and traditional cook who would prefer a little more hard work to make home made sauce rather than a jar but I truly did not expect people to want their life to be this easy for a price. Is she a millionaire? Is she extremely lazy? Does she have issue with knives? Does she own a knife? What a different world she lives in.

Just FYI I get that pre sliced vegetables is a thing but they're normally canned or frozen so you can store over long periods of time and don't have to cut when defrosting but that was a clear plastic bag that will let the onions go off in about 2 or 3 days.

They even tried to blame me and say this twat was a victim. The comments basically said I was 100% an asshole and what they did didn't matter. There was over 200 comments. Even got messages calling me a scumbag and that I should die because I am spreading propoganda when I even made clear that was one individual.

That is shocking, doesn't matter how you identify. A creep is a creep and you shouldn't see the world as ""who is the more oppressed one in this situation"". I've noticed a lot of this all over the internet too. Someone is clearly trying to abuse their position? They are LGBT so fake news. Someone has committed a crime? They are of a certain group so fake news. That isn't how the world works. Someone is treating their partner like crap? Oh but they are this gender so the other person clearly deserved it or it's fake. I deleted the post because of the amount of abuse people were saying. I just opened up about an assault and how I was glad I didn't just take it.

There are assholes in every inch of society, stop defending their actions because they identify a certian way. The majority of different groups are not assholes or creeps, so stop defending the exceptions.

Edit: Basically what that told me was it was completely okay to assault someone if you are a member of a certain group or they said something offensive to you AFTER. That is disgusting. The whole situation made me feel disgusting and violated but because I said something back, I'm a terrible human being. Essentially blaming the assault victim.

I  studied sales, I failed. Not wanting to be without any diploma because I valued it, I went towards teaching, I thought that helping people and teach the young ones would give me some purpose and belief in my work, it spoke to me much more than the business classes I had before. I failed too. Worked hard, but not smart enough, just like sales.

I didn't let it bring me down, I decided that if I was pretty dumb, I just might go into something where my hands might have a use. So I went into plumbing. And  just like the two before, I didn't manage it either. I once overheard my sister saying that it was sad to know that I worked hard but one can't compensate for being dumb. I heard that before I went into teacher classes, wanting to prove it wrong. I think she was right.

I never had a girlfriend. I struggled with people, had trouble making contacts. So I asked for advise and followed it. I dressed better, smiled more often, joined clubs I liked to meet up with people, kept myself fit, and more.

Nothing. I can do jokes, I can do sarcasm, that's it. I realized I bother people whenever I'm not doing one of these two things.

Now I'm lagging so far behind, people my age at least know somewhat what they want emotionally and in a relationship for having some experience  in it. I have less of a clue than a toddler, the 19 year old that kissed someone knows already more than I do. And if someone told me that they'd avoid me because they don't want to teach me pretty much everything about a relationship, I'd agree with them.

I've been planning to move out for a couple of months but have been sitting on my ass and yeah, I can say this was the breaking point.

\-

I woke up around 3 am to the sound of my parents laughing then followed by the sound of some retro-80's horror-moan-scream flick blasting over the room speakers. It honestly sounded like porn with rock music as the background. I remember smiling, too, at the thought that my parents could still laugh among one another after being together for so long, especially so early in the morning (after, I assume, just waking up) and also because both of their voices were so wholesome-sounding to me at that moment (and just loud enough to wake me from my slumber). I could still hear them laughing over the sound of whatever movie they were watching.

I can hear them going back and forth with their banter which is usual so I try to tone them out with a random YouTube video and fall back to sleep. It worked for a while but after about 20 minutes, their voices become boisterously loud and it sounds like my mom is crying. It also sounds like she's been drinking. I pause the video when the wall vibrates with the sound of a loud banging and I sit up in my bed. I listen.

My mom is banging her fist against the small pool table that takes up too much space in their already crowded room, arguing with my dad about his past abusive behavior; him punching or forcibly ""tapping"" her and ultimately kicking her in her ribs after she'd fall on the ground. This, of course, brought back my own ill memories of waking up almost every Saturday between the age of 8 and 14 and finding my mom asleep, naked, on the ground either on the cement floor of the basement or the carpeted floor of our old living room. I do actually remember my first time finding her in a state like that: I paused, started breathing really hard and got down on my knees beside her body and lightly pressed my finger into the folds of her side. Then, when that didn't stir her, I started tapping her shoulder and that turned into rocking her body while yelling, ""mom!"". Yep...

My brothers and I were physically and mentally abused by our father, thankfully we can say that we were never sexually abused though he did like to watch us strip naked and beat us with our clothes off. My oldest brother undoubtedly got the worst of it (my mom says it's because he looks like our uncle) and he doesn't feel enjoy being around us anymore. My youngest brother had to endure being being forced to chew his underwear when he wet the bed and of course, beat for it. The worst our father got was bondage (forcing us to one place with duct tape) and whipping us with an electrical cord (that broke the skin; our mom was too afraid to go to the police then and none of us said anything in school). My youngest brother was nearly drowned in a hot tub of bleach water for failing to come home after school one time (our parents assumed he might had been kidnapped and instead of beating him, he came up with the tub instead). It's so strange really, thinking back on all of this, and knowing that I was an unwilling participant to most of the abuse, having been told to shut up and watch or not having any other place to go and hearing the screams from another room in the house. My entire childhood was like that. My father stopped beating me around the time I was 11, I assume, because I was his daughter, and the last beating I ever got was naked. It was weird, how he stopped and stared at me laying there in a wet spot from my tear with a snotty nose, then telling to leave the room. Practically shoving me out. I remember that...

We did actually have an ""intervention"" before (just me and mom, which wasn't enough) but all my father did was deflect comments about his past abuse, especially those that were about mom, and in the end, sum it all up as to his upbringing or the way his parents raised him. He did say, ""I didn't know any other way"" in regards to disciplining us as children but dammit, we were never bad kids. He would beat us over any little thing and two of the worst memories my oldest brother has are two he will never forgive my father for - ever. It had become a running joke throughout our family that our dad, everyday, would come home in a mood and sniff out any little something as an excuse to beat one of my brothers. We accepted this as fact, and just as the way our life was. I remember my oldest brother telling me how disappointed he was with himself and dad when he tried to talk to him one-on-one about the abuse during his childhood; dad simply deflected or accepted, and ended everything as quickly as possible.

I can never understand what my mom silently went through: being told what to wear and how to wear it, being told to always be wearing makeup in the house when around him, being told to perform a certain way at the snap of a finger, and always at his beck and call, being told not to talk to strangers - especially men. I believe their relationship has made me into the woman I am today. And I also believe my mother is brainwashed beyond recognition but also, that it could be called compromise, in a marriage (domestic partnership; she's never had a wedding or a birthday party in a her adulthood - two things I remember her telling me she'd like very much). If I told you that she was afraid to say, ""no"" in any circumstance, and that she feared the repercussions of being her own person (having a social life, being allowed to have friends, being able to wear the clothes she'd like to wear, not being afraid to leave the house, and certainly not fearing for her safety for any bad news regarding the bills or work), would that be such a hard thing to believe? She's practically starving herself because he tells her when to eat and what to eat. It's sad when I see her eating ""behind his back"", like some starving child.

While I was away in the military, my brothers told me how they stepped in to defend mom against him when she was forced to make dinner and they were arguing just before she stepped into the kitchen. Apparently he was angry enough to appear as though he was building up to hit her. I was so proud of them.

Ultimately, the abuse stopped when my mom ran out of the house in lingerie and hailed a random passerby to give her a lift to the police station. So far, he's been arrested twice and fervently denies any accusations against him. The first time he was arrested was when my brother broke free and ran out of the house in his underwear just before he could be beat. Honestly, I can thank the military I wasn't here to experience any of this. I did however have to attest to the safety of my family over the phone with some psychiatrist (or someone from the court system) just before he was released (and he was in jail for less than a month).

So, back to how I initially started this OMC post. Mom was hashing out everything she had against him, and from the sound of his voice I could tell he was still laying in the bed. He simply egged her on, saying things like, ""keep going"" and ""you're doing great - get it all out"" in that coddling-mocking sort of voice as she was literally balling her eyes out and hitting the pool table in demonstration (I learned) as to how he hit her. I'm surprised I didn't hear the, ""are you done?"" line from him once she'd stopped. All of that, I learned, was because he wanted to have sex and she didn't want to. And much to my horror, he was forcing her. God, I remember my eyes going wide then that feeling of wanting to run far away so I wouldn't have to hear all of that but in a way, I think it's good that I did. It just cements the fact that I do have a reason to be as uncomfortable around my father as I am - as his only daughter. Since I've been home, the eery not-right feelings I've been getting have only gotten worse with no real explanations - it's all a mental thing but they're so real to me. Everyone has noticed how I don't like to be touched by him or even close but no one says anything about it but him (because, I suppose, he is a bit hurt about it no matter how much I smile and pretend I'm alright). I know deep inside that it's all psychological: from the middle-aged men who harassed and bullied me in the military all the way down to my childhood experiences. Whenever I am around my father these days, I just want whatever interaction we're having to hurry up and end, and I revert to my more jokingly-mean side if we're together for hours. It's undeniable that I am like my father; I am a splitting image of his mother (whom I never had the chance to meet), for crying out loud and that sometimes bothers me. Those genes I carry. I think a part of me, without truly admitting it, feels so far-away from and awkward around BOTH of my parents (because I feel odd around my mom, too, but not as much as my dad) because I simply don't want to be like, and don't ever want to relate to either of them. But I am and I do. And as an adult, I know that I can't let whatever happened growing up or my parents hold me back from achieving whatever it is I want or hope to do - but I do. I (sometimes, most times) blame them.

I got off track again - so mom leaves the room and goes to the kitchen to put some ice in her cup. She drops the cup. After maybe five minutes, dad comes out and tells her to go back into the room and from the words he spoke and how he sounded, he *pitied* her...

They go back in, and I can hear him possibly spanking her as she's walking away. Mom enters and refuses to leave the bathroom. And that's when the moment happens that spurs me to getting it off my chest and a violent wave of memories crash into me. Dad says, ""you can go ahead and sit on that toilet all you want, that won't ever change the fact that ***you belong to me***."" The way that he said it, while not in the least bit comical, did sound like some typical movie villain but that much more scarier in that it was my father saying it to my mother.

It's taken me about a little less than half an hour to type all of this but I heard it happen over the blare of the speakers. She left, I assume he was standing there against the pool table patiently waiting, I heard slapping noises (skin-on-skin) and some of protest and then some mumbled words followed by ""...***that's your job***...""

\-

As his only daughter, I can rightfully say that I don't feel comfortable around my father or even my mother, most times. I grew up in a household with a porn-addicted (he never did much to hide his collection and has been boasting about it since we were children; let it play on the television while we were around; I don't like helping him with issues on his smartphone these days either), abusive, controlling, possessive, often spiteful baby of a man and a woman who was too afraid to leave. Her weakness is exactly what he thrives off of and it's just a matter of fact. Now, after three kids, all of us adults, they're still stuck together. Neither of them have the money - and my mother doesn't have the agency - to leave. I absolutely love my parents, and would do anything for them. I've often supported them financially and have expressed my wishes to want to do more for them in the future but that is only because they have given me more than they could have ever dreamed possible. I cannot sit here and say that I didn't have a happy childhood, because I did. My dad spoiled me but as we all got older, life in the household just seemed to die out. We don't celebrate holidays anymore and the only thing anyone wants for their birthday is money. No longer the surprise gift. I don't want live with a man who watches teenage girls walk home from school along the street and reverses the truck so he can see which house they enter into (my brother and I witnessed the whole event almost like he'd completely forgotten we were in the truck with him); I don't want to live with a woman who is afraid to retrieve some simple thing from the car and when she does, closes the door lightly enough so he won't hear it (I confronted her about that but in a joking way then); I don't want to live with a man who emotionally manipulates you into doing what he wants despite your personal feelings (I've had to teach myself to not be afraid of him when he stands in front of me a certain way and to say no, to my own father); I don't want to live with a woman who hurriedly changes clothes and puts on makeup and breaks down when she thinks he'll say something about old she has become and how her body has changed. I definitely don't want to live with a near 50-something year old man who is forcing a near 60 year old woman whose had 3 children and a bone degenerative disease to look like a 20 year old co-ed or a woman who is absolutely ashamed of her body for aging. And these are all examples of things that have happened in just one year. I can't do this anymore. And I'm not strong enough to confront either of them because quite simply, it's not my place. Even as their daughter, I feel I have no ground to stand on. I feel like a friend of friend who is in a sinking ship of a marriage: I can't - or rather, don't want to - say or do anything that would cause an even greater rift in the relationship because it's not in my power or my responsibility to do so, I'm just there for support and available on weekends when the husband wants to go out for bowling.

So, of course, I'm looking for a place to stay. Someplace cheap. *Roaches R' Us*. I'll check up on my parents from time-to-time, of course. I absolutely love my parents, and are grateful for everything they have done for me and my brothers but it's time to move on. Both of my brothers already have and they're not looking back and when they occasionally do, it's with sadness, pity, hope and hatred...

**\*\*** Tried posting this to r/OffMyChest but it wasn't showing up for whatever reason. Spoke to mom in the kitchen, apparently dad woke up and started drinking and made her drink with him before the encounter. I have noticed a lot of alcohol being brought home the past couple weeks but it was always a normal sight, I didn't think much of it. Mom accused him of cheating on her multiple times, but having witnessed it once while he was at work and becoming upset with him when he denied it. Mom also think he's suppressing homosexual tendencies. Really, she's upset with him because she has bad memories of men in her life who drank in copious amounts whenever something was wrong but obviously, dad won't tell her anything personal.

It's not often my home gets this much coverage internationally, to the point where a few posts here and there about ""hey the sky is red in Australia"" is considered fame, but this really does prove there is such thing as bad publicity.

For those out of the loop, for the past month or so Australia has been on fire. Literally. While bushfires (wildfires) are nothing uncommon here, it's something we expect every year around summer time this time it's out of control. The fires have razed an area the size of the Netherlands in New South Wales alone, leading to Canberra, the capital city, to have [the worst air quality in the world.](https://i.redd.it/na9a98h852841.jpg) Smoke is so thick you can't see a mile ahead of you, to the point where it's even affecting people living in [South Island in New Zealand.](https://i.imgur.com/KYTu0Ij.jpg) Entire towns, like Mogo, a small town south of the popular tourist city Bateman's Bay have been [incinerated.](https://i.redd.it/oqfrh7ljvy741.jpg) Gone. Destroyed. There's nothing left. Now you might think ""oh Australia, you put up with this all the time a little heat isn't much right?""

And sure, we deal with 40 degree (C, that's around 104Fl) days all the time in the summer. But when temperatures average that [ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY?](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6551029/australia-again-breaks-average-temp-record/?cs=14231) That's something to start panicking about. Especially when these fires are [worse than the california, amazon and siberia fires COMBINED,](https://i.redd.it/ijfm87jjt2841.jpg) we *really* need help.

How did this happen? Well, essentially: it's the government's fault. Specifically the Liberals but Australia's other political parties have a role in this too. Let's run through those at fault or involved here.

**The Liberal-National Coalition Party -** Australia's current ruling party. They have a delightful program which includes:

* building a coal mine on top of the great barrier fucking reef
* slashing funding from the CSIRO causing scientists to bail to other countries and then we have to buy the shit they invent from other guys *even when we could’ve gotten it ourselves for free*
* axing the one opportunity to get nationwide free high-speed internet
* making our education system worse than Kazakhstan
* fucking over public schools and poor/middle class people in general
* excessive pointless military spending
* the shitfuckery that is the lockout laws
* slashing funding to the fire service leaving firefighters unprepared for things like the bushfires raging now
* claiming coal is “a renewable resource”
* doing fuck all to stop climate change, causing apocalyptic bushfires that have killed 500 million animals, including 30% of all of Australia’s Koala population
* speeding up Australia’s slow March to fascism with increasing police militarisation and surveillance and fuckloads of corporate propaganda-I mean “”news””
* cutting taxes to the rich while the rest of us starve
* desecrating sacred indigenous sites

And of course, that’s not including the problems we already had!

They were voted into office in 2013 with a man named Tony Abbot. All you need to know about him is that his approval rating fell from 60% to 40% in 100 days, and he was voted out of his seat this year, good riddance. So, the party kicked him out in 2015 and replaced him with a guy named Malcolm Turnbull, who was worse for a whole lot of other reasons unrelated to bushfires - basically he butchered our one chance at state-wide free internet, and did a whole lot of nothing to fix the country's previous problems. He was kicked out in August of 2018 by our incumbent Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, or as he was known when he came to office - ""who?""

Now who would be surprised but Scotty is even worse. He - along with New South Wales State Premier (essentially governor) Gladys Berejiklian, also a Liberal - slashed funding to the rural fire service after they were, somehow, reelected to office last April. Gladys is a standard corporate shill who somehow looks like if a muppet was human and has earned the affectionate title of ""Koala Killer"" due to her deforestation policies and slashing funding to the firies which has resulted in the deaths of 30% of total Koala populations in Australia. Fun. Scotty, on the other hand, is even worse. He is an avowed climate denier - delivering a speech on [""coalophobia"" and how ""coal is renewable""](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjUxven1-HmAhVzzTgGHbfVA0kQwqsBMAB6BAgKEAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2Fvideo%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F09%2Fscott-morrison-brings-a-chunk-of-coal-into-parliament-video&amp;usg=AOvVaw3tcbZUPCIMoxGErTS3LUJN) in parliament, and one of his mates - whom he speaks with semi-regularly - [is a QAnon conspirator!](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/05/qanon-conspiracy-theorist-friends-australian-prime-minister-scott-morrison) And this is, of course, on top of slashing funding to the CSIRO causing a Brain Drain, approving a coal port *ON TOP OF THE GREAT BARRIER FUCKING REEF,* police brutality to non-violent XR protestors, systemic racism against Indigenous Australians, desecration of sacred indigenous sites, bloated military spending, compliance in US and Indonesian Crimes against Humanity, Climate Denialism, Union Busting and the systemic destruction of our country's environment and general neoliberal corporate shitfuckery as our nation slowly degrades into Fascism. Heed our warning, America. Neoliberalism will destroy you.

**Is there any hope for Australia to be changed from the inside?**

FUCK NO!

There isn't a party to oppose the Liberals anymore. It used to be Labor but they're so utterly broken from losing the last election in April they don't stand a chance. At the moment, there aren't any parties that stand a serious chance at overthrowing them. And the Liberals are losing credibility, and fast, because of these fires. But what will they do now?

Their plan was to lose the last election (hence why they booby-trapped it with expensive military contracts that would need to be payed by the time the next election comes around) and that actually backfired on them. So will they just replace the prime minister *again?* The alternatives are worse than ScoMo! There's our corrupt treasurer Joe Hockey, who looks more like a Mafia boss than actual Mafia bosses, Peter Dutton; the man who looks like he saw the pits of hell and liked what he saw (that or the tower of mordor given human form) or our failed economist Josh Frydenburg. Or worse, it could go to our environmental minister, a lady who unironically believes in fucking *numerology* \- for those who don't know, it's a pseudoscientific belief that numbers are magic. Basically, spirituality for people who think astrology is too scientific. Australia has no AOC, Bernie Sanders or Jeremy Corbyn. No Green New Deal. No Green Industrial Revolution. Any way you shape it, we're *FUCKED.*

**So, what can be done?**

**Well, you could support or donate to any of these charities and organisations:**

**THE RURAL FIRE SERVICE -** please please please please *please* donate to the [Rural Fire Service.](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/volunteer/support-your-local-brigade) They're tax deductible and unlike police officers Firemen don't shoot dogs or black people.

**EXTINCTION REBELLION -** this goes without saying, but they are one of the most popular political groups amongst zoomers and millennials, and are quite active in Australia. [Donate if you can. Remember, $1AUD is around 70US cents.](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/8c10ba255c2007b43becc806b7db9d4833d7f9c6?source=direct_link&amp;)

**STOP ADANI -** Adani is that Indian coal company that got approved to built a coal port on top of the great barrier reef. The only reason they haven't (yet) is because of the WWF repeatedly hitting them with bullshit lawsuit after bullshit lawsuit, and of course Stop Adani. [Their cause is just as important as the fires.](https://www.stopadani.com/) Speaking of which...

**THE WORLD WILDLIFE FOUNDATION -** environmental conservation is serious business, especially here in Australia. They're a not-for-profit that has (so far) stopped Adani from building that coal port. [Please help.](https://www.wwf.org.au/#gs.pjz5vm)

**Second of all, politically, there needs to be a massive shift in power in Australia.** 

Currently, the Liberals are losing a lot of credibility and fast. Australia is a *de facto* two-party country - the opposite to the Liberals in the Labor Party, who are more or less Social Democrats. Social Democrats who love coal. After being utterly destroyed in the 2019 election, the Labor Party is fractured and splintered. They are a shell of what they used to be, so we can't rely on them to help us.  

Right now, Australians are very apolitical. Very much an attitude of “I don’t care as long as it doesn’t affect me”. However, a lot of us are being affected by the fires. People are starting to, albeit slowly, wake up to the reality. Gladys Berejiklian is desperately trying to make sure the fires “aren’t politicised”, because if they are people will realise it’s her fault and the fault of her party. It will take a lot of effort to convince people to care, so any sort of armed uprising is a long way off. It’ll be an uphill battle to say the least.

Fortunately, there is very much an air of a “power vacuum” in the country as the Liberals lose more and more credibility. Currently, there is no one filling that vacuum. Yet.

If one of the Communist parties or the greens steps up then things will definitely start to change. The greens is unlikely considering that they’re rather unpopular on account of being the scapegoat for the liberals every time something goes wrong. It happened on Black Saturday, it's happening now.

All parties that actually want to fix things are rather small. The best we can hope is either the greens make a miraculous turnaround and are suddenly beloved the nation over or the Australian Communist Party (Yes, the Communists are the only other ones that support doing something about climate change) starts making traction. That will take a while, but it’s the best we can hope for.

Australia doesn't have a Green New Deal. We don't have a ""Green Industrial Revolution"". There is no major ""socialist"" groups or individuals. in government. British Labour is very different from Australian Labor. Therefore, we'll need to find a solution to the climate crisis outside Canberra. Are there any political parties in Australia that have solutions to Climate Change? 

Yes. Also, 90% of those parties are Communist.

(I did not make this up, these really are the only political parties in Australia that actually support doing something about Climate Change. Yes, it's that bad.)

**THE GREENS -** The greens get a bad rep, they're basically the scapegoat of the country, getting blamed whenever something goes wrong, and these fires are no exception. The Liberal's official stance is that ""It's the Greens fault because two of their mayors cut back on backburning in two remote towns"". It's unlikely the Greens will gain enough power to take office, but seeing as they hold a decent foothold in elections (\~15-20% of the vote) it's not impossible. Australia needs action now, but hey... [Website here.](https://greens.org.au)

**AUSTRALIAN COMMUNIST PARTY -** A newly-formed Communist party that aims to overthrow the liberals and create a socialist state. Money to them will go to either feeding homeless people, creating volunteers for the Fire Service, or creating counter-propaganda to break the spell of the Liberal Party's stranglehold on media. No, they don't support China. [Anything helps.](https://www.auscp.org.au/donations)

**COMMUNIST PARTY OF AUSTRALIA -** They are what Marxists call ""revisionist"" because they want to ally with labor. They also have a strong climate policy stance and don't support China. Donate to them [here.](https://www.cpa.org.au/guardian-press-fund/index.html)

**VICTORIAN SOCIALISTS -** Bernie Bros your time has come. They're a (very) small democratic-socialist party with two mayors in Victoria, which has been hit pretty hard by the fires. [Donating to them will help them in their next election cycle.](https://www.victoriansocialists.org.au/donate)

**ANY OF AUSTRALIA'S TROTSKYIST PARTIES -** Australia has like four of them and they all hate each other but they all are doing than the liberals to combat climate change and the fires. Which is a pretty low bar seeing as the liberals are doing nothing, but it's still worthwhile.

this launched a debate between me and her arguing our points. she made points like i was enabling racism, making an n word joke is a form of racism, ect. i said that i genuinely don’t care whether or not people choose to say it. after half an hour of pointless heated debate, i began to say “i respect your opinion but this debate is going nowhere”. she continued to say she wasn’t fine with me as i reiterated that i see what she thinks but i don’t have the same opinion. after trying to defuse the situation for half an hour, she eventually said that she needed me to recognize her opinion (which i have done) if we were going to continue being freinds. 
this discussion obviously wasn’t civil anymore so i just summed up my stance on the subject with a quick summary. 
she ghosted me and i doubt there will be any friendship left. i continuously said that i respect her and what she thinks and hope we can remain friendly towards each other. she clearly believed that if i had a different opinion on this matter, we couldn’t remain freinds.

She still had a hole in her pallette from where the bullet crashed through, and therefore had a feeding tube. She lost a lot of strength on her left side and seemed to be losing more. She had a tracheotomy still because her throat and vocal chords were still ripped up and she had trouble breathing without it sometimes. She could talk raspily but slurred her words, and she was incontinent. 

Her spirit is all but gone. She was driven. She was fiery. She was generous. She was completely selfless. Now its like talking to a ghost. It's the same person but she's been drained of life. She just exists in a state of innocence. The part of her brain that they removed affected her decision making and her sense of right and wrong.

And I wish she died.

She didnt even want to be alive before, and now she needs someone to be with her 24/7 to make sure she doesn't hurt herself.

How I should have known she was reaching that breaking point. 

People always say, ""There's nothing you could have done."" Fuck that. Yes there is. Maybe I would have only delayed it, maybe I would have only been in her way. But maybe I would've been in her way long enough to get her to change tracks. Maybe if I didn't have my head so far up my own ass I would've noticed why she returned my spare keys to my drawer that morning.

I feel like I lost her because I didn't deserve her.

While it's true it might have been all the bullying at school, our poverty, being a minority etc... I feel like my sister did contribute to it. More like she was a toxic influence on my mentality. And I don't use the word 'toxic' lightly. Growing up, I always went along with her telling me what to do because she kept saying 'it's for your own good'. I was 8 ok? But then one, day, I guess I grew up, or woke up I realized something. I was about 14. 

The next time she said 'it's for your own good' I asked 'do you actually care how I feel though'. I asked her over and over again why she would do the things she did to me, yelling, screaming, subtle threats that if I told anyone, our parents, something bad would happen such as destroying my homework. I asked her if 'it's for my own good, does my emotional health come into play? Is it for my own good if it's destroying my mental health?'. Maybe I  should be glad she wasn't  the most perfect monster that she could lie, but she would always avoid the answer and scream and cry and act like I was the bad guy, that how dare I accuse her of being heartless.

By the time I was sixteen, I realized in all the 2 years not once did she say 'I care about you'. I never figured why she always wanted to control me. she would scream and flip if I didn't eat the way she wanted. stuff like 'you aren't eating enough'. I don't know if it's linked to her own eating disorder but she has so much issues with controlling people. 

Anyways, thankfully by that time I had learned to say no and she was losing her power over me the one I had given her.

I slapped my girlfriend when we were in an argument, and I haven’t been able to forgive myself for it. 

She got an iPod touch for Christmas, and she let me borrow it. My dad saw me with it and took it from me, i don’t remember why. He’s always been incredibly strict so I was always in trouble in high school, so it was probably for some generic reason. I was too terrified of my dad to tell him where i got it from. He knew about my girlfriend, and he was adamantly against us dating. But I continued to see her at school, even going early and staying late to spend time with her. Anyway, we had a bit of a tense discussion about how we could get her iPod touch back. I came up with some elaborate scheme but I don’t remember what it was. My girlfriend instead told her mom, who sent her Nigerian boyfriend to talk to my Nigerian dad, thinking that Nigerian connection would help them get along. Instead my girlfriend’s mom’s Nigerian boyfriend cursed out my Nigerian dad. My dad met her mom to return the iPod, but naturally i was in a new level of trouble. 

The next day at school, i tried to talk to her about it. We weren’t really on good terms because of the iPod tussle, so she didn’t really want to talk to me. She walked away from me twice, and i pulled but back toward me twice. The third time, I’d what happened but she said something and i slapped her. I’ve never hit anyone in the face out of malice before. Even in fights I’ve always needed gloves before i could hit someone in the face. I don’t really know how it happened. It felt subconscious.

A school security guard saw this happen, and, naturally, I was expelled. Luckily for me, it was a few days before my 18th birthday, so i didn’t go to jail. And I applied early decision and was accepted to an Ivy League university, so my high school took pity on me and didn’t report my expulsion to the university. 

Since then, I’ve been haunted by what I did to her. I had nightmares for months after it, and even now get them when I’m at a low. Now that I was a woman beater, I kind of gave up on myself. I decided i would never get married, never have kids, because i didn’t want to be abusive, and I was scared that i would be, especially because i don’t know what possessed me to slap her in the first place. My dad thought I must have been possessed or something. He couldn’t believe I would hit a woman. 

Since then, it’s been hard to pursue relationships or close friendships. I’ve convinced myself that I’m toxic, that everyone else is better off if they’re away from me. So anytime i got low, I’d ruin reletionships, withdraw from friendships, and irreparably burn bridges so no one has to be around someone as manipulative and abusive as me.

The fact that this sub had to split off from /r/offmychest is pretty much proof of that. 

It's all based on ideology. The same shit that would get a conservative banned, the leftists get a free pass on. A right wing sub with the same laissez faire attitude as Chapo Trap House does on murdering cops would be banned in a day. 

Default subs are no more than corporate shills and useful idiot leftist mods who do no more than enforce the will and censorship of the corporations they claim to hate.

Nike does a WOKE ad campaign, and suddenly they forget all about their sweatshops. 

Reddit takes millions of dollars from TenCent, a Chinese government shell company, and it's crickets.

They call everyone on the right ""Nazis"" while they call for censorship, gun confiscation, and blame all of society's problems on one race. ""Old white men"". 

They hold Islam to be a sacred thing, yet Christianity is a free target. I've been banned from subs on threads about the Gay Jesus movie for talking about how they shadow-removed my comment on how they'd never dare to make a gay Mohammad movie. When I asked them why it was okay to make fun of Jesus, but not Mohammad, they never answered the question. They danced around it, called me racist, which is funny, because Islam is not a race.

I was desperate for money and a better life , and while I wasn’t interested in shooting porn, I was willing to do nude modeling. Being underage at the time, I admit I lied about my age to make an account, but always told people who messaged me my real age. I got so many offers, over 50 the first day I signed up. It wasn’t until one week later that I nervously responded to an “agency” claiming to offer high pay for nude shoots. I immediately accepted, as they also said that travel and expenses would all be paid, I was especially interested in the fact that relocation was an requirement, and being from an abusive household I needed an escape.



I already had a passport and was sent a confirmation for the flight, as well as the digital boarding pass. Everything went smoothly when I boarded my flight. I was met by a man who I was told about through the website. He was very nice, well-dressed, and treated me well. He told me that he would be taking me to the agency where I would fill out paperwork and get started with the shoots. I was ecstatic, even at home, nobody ever treated me this well. He gave me water, we stopped by a place for lunch, and afterwards, he proceeded to take me to where I thought, was the agency.



It was obviously not was I was expecting. He told me to wait in the car, and still, me being naïve I sensed nothing wrong, while he got out and opened the trunk. We were nowhere near anywhere safe. It looked like a big forest, only one small building with several cars parked outside. I just waited for him to come back, and he did. He had a small black bag in his hand, and when he got back inside the car he tossed it at me and told me to open it. I listened, in the bag was a piece of lingerie and heels. He told me to take my clothes off and put them on, and if I didn’t listen he would kill me and nobody would find my body. I was so scared. I’d never been that terrified in my life. I knew that I’d made a terrible mistake and regretted being stupid enough to let myself get into this situation. He watched me while I took my clothes on, and dressed in the lingerie. He then proceeded to drag my out of the car, by the hair, into the building. I would have listened to him if he told me to walk. But I think he enjoyed being in control, and treating someone weak as if they’re nothing.



In the building There were several other men. I don’t know if there were other girls. I wouldn’t be surprised, but if there were, they kept us separate so we were more vulnerable. These men inside of the building stared at me like the situation was nothing. I was ordered to dance and they laughed and made fun of me while I cried. I was shaking, almost naked, and they had no care. It was a joke to them. After they told me to stop dancing, I was taken into a different room where I was gang raped for what felt like several hours. I just gave up, didn’t put up a fight, didn’t say no after several attempts and being responded with threats, I laid on a bed while they did whatever they wanted to me. I was kept in this room for years, after being beaten, raped, abused, made fun of, laughed at by men who paid to do these things to me.I had no contact from the outside world, and the only reason I survived was because I managed to convince a “client” to help me. I told him I was being held against my will and that he had to help me. He was generous enough to tell one of the men keeping me that he would pay extra to take me to a hotel, and would bring me right back. He bought it but was reluctant, and gave the client instructions on what to do if I didn’t listen to him. He drove me to a hospital where I was treated for injuries and told a doctor what happened. I didn’t want to make a report or get any of the men in trouble, in fear that someone would find me and hurt me. The doctor tried to convince me to report, but I wouldn’t. And I still wouldn’t. I live in fear for my life everyday, thinking that one of them will find me and take me back to that horrible life I endured as a sex slave.

I have been twice blessed with the boob gods. Seriously, I wear a FF cup and often have to order bras online because stores don't carry a 34FF/G. My complaint about having knockers isn't the weight of them (and yes they are heavy) but I'm literally suffocating myself trying to hoist them up to my armpits. I don't have those huge porn boobs that are perfect beach balls, they're regular breasts that hang down when they're not unnaturally suspended in the air with elastic and hooks.

And if you don't have this same problem, let me tell you: wearing a bra HURTS. Especially the underwire kind. Or the strapless kind. Or the sports bra. Basically any bra with high to medium support.

Well, I had an epiphany this morning. I looked forlornly at the bras discarded on my floor after work yesterday and realized I didn't want to wear one.

So I didn't.

Instead I put a camisole under my shirt and I felt GREAT all day. Completely forgot what I'd done by midday and found myself not constantly looking at the clock and wishing I was home. And I realized it was because I wasn't in pain today like usual. I didn't have to dig my fingernails under the wire to get relief in the bathroom. And it was awesome.

So, fellow boob-owners, I urge you to give a camisole (or nothing at all!) instead of a bra a try. Forget what people think and all the beauty standards that insist boobs must be unnaturally perky. A camisole does everything a bra does but without the pain, it keeps them in place, prevents hard nipple embarrassment, and it even adds another layer to prevent a see-through shirt fiasco.

It's actually extremely difficult to even communicate the smallest concern, problem or thought when you are deep into depression or anxiety.

And don't stop. They might not be able to in the moment you do it ...they will feel like a burden or that you really don't mean your good intentions because that's what their brains tell them.  Help them break that cycle. Be genuine.
And if you can't ....don't put statements out there in a way that it's their fault they didn't reach out. This hurts them more.

But I thought as Aussies, we are better than what we are.

An organisation with 58,000 people in it, so we aren't a massive military. that's 58,000 including Active reserves, for the entire Australian Military. (As a comparison, the United States Marine Corps, a single Corps, not even a branch of the military is 182,000 people.)

Now with all these fires, the ADF has to offer the help, the Federal government has to offer it to the states or the states request it. Even if it's offered, it has to be accepted. Victoria accepted, New South Wales didn't. This is basic shit about government you are taught in Primary school when you learn about levels of government.

But from both states, I'm seeing people bitching that the military isn't doing enough.

I'm Victoria the military is throwing all that they can at it, every chopper they can spare is being thrown at it, we gave them the entire HMAS Choules to do evacuations, as well as a number of smaller ships to evacuate people. So a substantial chunk of the navy is Dian there, we're also throwing Army Engineers and Cooks and Truckies at the efforts to move fuel, open roads, it's a huge effort.

Thousands of ADF members are helping out, either directly or supporting the direct assistance. Those that aren't are on very very short notice to move. But that's very few people as well.

But I don't know what people think they could do more? Like, what can the military do? It's not like they are some super specialised firefighting force, they can't just walk in and stop the fires with a magic wand.

Maybe if you wanted them earlier you should have leaned against your state government more to do something, to request it.

But seriously, the military is geared for fighting and killing enemies of the country, not fight fires. What silver bullet solution are people expecting?

Or is it no matter what the military does, it's not enough? Are these people just looking to bitch?

I always thought of us Aussies as being a great community of people, help each other out, if I didn't have cancer I'd have told work they can shove it up their arse I'm going to fight fires, I'm still a qualified firefighter and truck driver, medically I can't though. I'm hard pressed getting out of my chair these days, and it's fucking killing me that I can't help.

I'm listening to the fire scanner where my family is down near the South Coast of NSW, you can HEAR the firefighters are fucked, these guys are volunteers, but they're constantly doing the job of police, stopping people from looting, stopping people from harassing other firefighters, [people are lighting fires all over the place](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-27/nsw-rfs-volunteer-charged-over-lighting-fires/11741412)

But I'm seeing looting, burglary, people not helping their mates and bitching about what is being done to help as it's not enough. Resources are stretched to the limit, everyone is doing as much as they can. But instead people are bitching that it's not enough.

[People are even setting up bogus fundraisers ](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-02/fire-victims-family-outraged-at-fake-online-fundraiser/11837920)

What happened to our country to breed this entitled bunch of people that aren't happy with all the hard work that's being done? Where did these wholesale scammers come from?

What happened to Aussie mateship?

I open Facebook and all I'm seeing is toxic posts about how no one is doing enough, fingers being pointed at anyone and everyone.

The Australia I grew up in was respect for military and firefighters, respect for your fellow Australian. But that's not what I'm seeing in this disaster.

I see it more and more that people use ""would of"" instead of ""would have"". If you google it, you will see that it is grammatically incorrect.

I'm not a native english speaker.

So  lately I (m/17) visited one of my best friends  (f/16) for the first time. 

Short Backstory: 

Actually I fell in love with her. Not like ""crushing"" or something. I thought this time was something different than with other girls I have met. I can speak with her openly about *anything*. She made/makes me really happy. The fulfilling kind of happiness. 
She has shown me so damn many signals that she might like me too. (But actually I've been wrong.)

Actual problem:
So I thought it was different this time. She often wanted to cuddle etc. 
(I am someone who doesn't really have that kind of friends who have less problems with body contact). Thats why I tried to cuddle as much as possible.. It sounds weird but it was something special to me. 

Fast forward. Today I drove back home.. During my ride back home she texted me that she was very umcomfortable with us cuddling and getting that close. So I was too affective and got too intimate.

Actually I feel ashamed. I want to be a comfortable person. A good human being. It Didn't work. 

I think she is aware of my feelings for her 
The worst thing is, I know now that my feelings for her won't be returned. It feels like an important piece of my life got ripped away.
I got over other crushes, this time not. Actually I did my very best not to cry in my math coaching today.

I deeply apologized for my behaviour, she responded, that it was good to settle that, so the next time we meet won't be weird or anything.

I'm not sure if this is a good sub for just...venting but I hope it is good enough.

Lotsa backstory: 
I've been doing pretty good for awhile now. Almost a year without hallucinations and while college went to shit I'm...managing. I have a lovely fiancee, a roof over my head and somehow my money issues always get somehow resolved in the end. So in a sense, I have a lot to be grateful. 

Still...despite the progress I had a complete meltdown today. The year started off promising and suddenly my feed is bombarded with WW3 news, memes and what not. 

Because my anxiety is so strong sometimes, I absolutely don't read or listen to news. I come across a news article or two from time to time, but I generally like living under a rock because it's one less stressful thing for me.

So..what happened?

My fiancee was just playing on her laptop while I was browsing reddit on my own. I see meme after meme about the upcoming WW3 and eventually get some news sources about it too. I'm also not exactly out of range for some people to start spamming communities totally unrelated to global warming... about how global warming will kill us if we don't do shit in the next 9 years. 

This eventually got way too overwhelming. I just...shut down. I dropped my phone and was quiet on the bed for a long, long time. Feeling small and helpless and scared. I just felt like the world was caving in and...crushing everything I hold dear (there is a REASON I don't read news).

Eventually my fiancee comes to comfort me. Asks me if I'm feeling okay, if it's physical or mental pain, what caused it.. I explain briefly it's just I think we're all going to die and what's the point if that's the case? I try to explain and she's all unbothered and calm. I ask her why she can be so calm about it. 

""I just can.""

I... don't know what it was in those words that set me off. It was a really brief moment were a lot happened, and I did give her a hell of a scare. I straight up started screaming and crying and trashing items around myself. I was just so...overcome with everything. Fear, anxiety, helplessness, loneliness, having no meaning... I haven't had such a strong breakdown in a long time and that also doesn't help. It's like I'm going back to how things were last year, all that progress down the drain for what? Because some goddamn meme got to my head? Am I really THAT weak?

I'm more calm now, luckily, and we're both okay. I think. But the thing is I can't shake off the feeling. No matter how much she tells me ""it's most likely not going to be an actual WW3"" I can't shake off the feeling that something big, bad and destructive is coming. Something is going to kill us all. We're all going to die and the world is going to end.

It scares me.

First off, I just want to get all of this off my chest. Thank you for reading! If there were no stigma or judgement, I would scream all of this to people who tried to invalidate me. Appearing to have my crap together on the outside does not mean I am not hurting inside.

I am tired of being told that my life is easy, nothing bad happened to me, everybody has bad things also, etc. When I seek support and validation, I am not looking to invalidate others' struggles or compare myself to start a misery competition. I completely understand that I am very fortunate to be at my current position; a lot could've gone wrong. I respect everybody's battles, and I wish for everyone to keep healing.

Here is my journey, thank you again for reading.

At 2, my sister was born. While I love my sister and never resented her, all family, friends, and acquaintances favored her over me (to be fair, I was an ugly kid, and she was really adorable). Nobody heard me.

At 3, I still struggled to speak properly. I had speech problems, and I had a hard time expressing myself verbally.

At 4, I was raped repeatedly over the course of a few weeks by the school janitor. After being sodomized by a mop, I get pushed down to urine and then get hosed off. When I return to the classroom, my teacher scolded me for using the bathroom for took long and playing with water. The school finally figured out what went on and did nothing. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me. Since then, I had a stutter that I could not get rid of until my late teens.

At 5, I learned to skin pick my buttocks, so blood would continue to appear on my underwear.

From 5 to 8, I was constantly blamed and berated by my aunt for troubles her children caused and I was in no part of. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me.

From 6 to 12, my parents took turns getting sick and checking in and out of hospitals. One time, my parents were away for almost a year for treatment abroad because they could not afford healthcare in the states. Nobody heard me.

At 7, I was the target of my 2nd grade teacher's constant bullying. I had the second highest grade in the class. Yet, that was not good enough for her. She singles me out and berates me for the entire school year in front of everyone for every little thing. No one heard me.

At 8, I moved to the states. A few kids in the classroom offered to ""help me transition"" in front of the teacher, and then proceed to emotionally and physically abuse and bully me behind the teacher. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me. I did not know how to speak English.

From 8, my uncle, whose family sponsored us to emigrate, was terribly verbally abuse towards me for existing and causing ""problems"" in his family. He loved my sister, but hated me. Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me.

From 9, I learned to skin pick my genitals. It feels better than picking my buttocks, when I needed to feel better.

From 9 to 13, we were told to stay quiet in the house and not go outside while my mom works, or else our semi-racist neighbor might call child protective service. We were not well off. Sometimes, my mom showed up with food that she scavenge from restaurant garbage and were just thrown out.

From 9 to 15, I had two friends, who repeatedly stood me up for other plans. I offered kindness to others and sought friendship, only to receive manipulation and emotional abuse.

At 10, my mom had a house keeping job. My sister and I went to help wash strangers' toilets and underwear. I watch these strangers, who paid her minimum wage, berate my mom in front of me, and I could not do anything.

At 10, I ran the household, paid bills, made calls, and make sure everything is up-to-date. My parents tired their best, but both of them were rarely both home due to work and time at hospital and spoke very little English. Nobody heard me.

At 10, my PE teacher berated me in front of the entire locker room for ""attacking"" my classmate. My classmate just wanted me to feel his ""six-pack."" Nobody stood up for me. Nobody heard me.

From 10, I learned to skin pick my scalp. This feels good as well.

At 11, I constantly did not have enough food for lunch. I walked around and asked my classmates for their leftovers. I did not want to tell my parents that I was hungry. They tried their best.

At 12, we finally have healthcare. No more lining up for clinics or going to unlicensed doctors for treatment.

At 15, I discovered the guitar, and had been obsessed with getting better at this instrument every since. Music is my refuge from the turbulence inside my head and my loneliness.

At 16, I finally have my first group of real friends. I felt inadequate. While I loved them to death, I always felt like they were just letting this underprivileged kid tag along.

At 18, I got into the university of my choice on almost a full scholarship. I was told that I will not succeed.

From 19, I started to abuse alcohol. It was not hard for me to go through bottles of wine or 6-packs when I wanted to cope with negative feelings.

From 19, I learned that seeking validation reduces my fear of rejection. I work my ass off academically, socially, and in extra-curricular activities to maximize opportunities of being validated by others. Because of my thirst for validation, I go out of my way to please others. I don't want anybody to have anything negative to say about me anymore. My stutter went away, and I was finally confident about myself. My classmates said I was lucky to be even at school and I did not deserve to be successful academically. They said that my underprivileged background did not matter and was only used to seek pity.

From 21 to 27, I was constantly on the receiving end of then-girlfriend (now wife)'s anger, rage, and emotional abuse due to her (most likely misdiagnosed) depression. My fear of abandonment and thoughts of self-harm and suicide worsen. I love her. When we were not hurting, she made me a better person. I will not leave her, and we will heal together.

At 21, I graduated summa cum laude in electrical engineering and received an award from the school chancellor for community service. I had no school debt. People said I was ""lucky.""

At 21, I bought my first car, but my parents decided for me. It was not my choice.

At 22, I bought my first house, but not by choice. Grandma got kicked out of my aunt's house and needed a place to stay. My parents told me to buy a house for tax benefits and ""save money."" I did not want to buy a house.

At 24, I completed my Master's degree while working full-time. My friends said I would die trying to work and go to school. I did not have to pay a cent for this degree.

At 25, I started a new job at a tech company. I was called ""stupid"" by my colleagues behind my back because I was new to the industry.

At 26, I received my first patent. I was one of the group's best circuit designers.

At 29, I bought my second house with my then-girlfriend. We finally have a stable home. My wife's mental health crumbled shortly after.

At 29, my then-girlfriend (now wife) was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My home life has been turbulent since then, and I was constantly put on the edge. I was constantly on the receiving end of her psychotic episodes. The voices in her head makes her angry, sad, or lose all feelings. She always wants to run away, leave me, or hurt herself. She can be a different person by the hour. When I sought support, people said I was fishing for sympathy behind my back. I need to keep everything together, for her sake.

At 31, I married my wife. I love her, and we will heal together. I will never leave her alone.

At 31, my wife relapsed and quit her job without any warning. For a few months, my days were spent caring for her and being on receiving end of her worst psychotic rages.

At 31, I received my tenth patent. Nobody questions my abilities as an engineer.

At 32, my suicide ideation worsens due to relationship conflicts and stresses from care giving. Everyday, I wanted to walk in front of a train or truck or jump off a building.

Being Indian, physical and verbal abuse is something you go through during childhood when you parents feel like they need to discipline you. Even if it's the smallest things.

I've been depressed since the age of 13, and it hurt a lot.

2 years ago I came out to them (one of the LGBTs) and also told them I was depressed. They were completely against both things (depression isn't real, and I am an idiot for believing that LGBT is a thing).

I've been through a few interventions and verbal abuse since then.

It hurts. I love them. They love me. But verbal abuse triggers my childhood trauma and I want to either kill myself or hurt myself. And it also makes me wish that they would leave.

I feel dead, and my depression is through the roof right now, but i can't be angry at her. 

My husband and i are crammed into a 700 square foot, 2 bedroom, trailer with 4 year old and a 3 month old, and a 6 year old every weekend. So 5 people crammed into this house. We've been planning on forever to move, but my husband now finally make enough money to be able to afford mortgage payments. So we were CASUALLY looking at homes. Nothing serious for the most part. But then we found the absolute perfect house for us. It's the very definition of everything we wanted in a house, and isn't even expensive. ($100,000) and we could afford the monthly payments for everything in that house. But, because this world is absolute shit and runs off of whether you have credit cards or not, we got turned down for a fucking FHA loan due to neither of us having ever had a credit card. Never mind that we can actually afford it, we don't get the opportunity because of fucking credit. So we resolved to try to do anything to quickly fix this so we can get the house. 

Well yesterday i was talking to my mom about it all (we're super close, talk about everything, and she's been up to date on all of this) and we were talking about credit. She mentioned what her credit was (good) and how she got approved for a credit card so she could make it even better (she had been working on it for a long time) and i joked that i wish either me or my husband had her credit because then we would get approved. She then said ""well maybe i could co-sign with you."" I first told her no, she's done enough for us from when she helped us with bills when we went through a rough patch a while ago. She said then said ""Well, if all else falls through then think about it"" and i then went home a little while later. I mentioned it to my husband and he said no as well because he hates getting help from her, just because he hates asking for help period. But then he realized that it would be the only way we could get the house. So, i bit the bullet and asked her. I first asked if she was honestly serious about the offer, and that it was ok if she wasn't. That she could say no and it would be fine. She told me that she was serious, and to just let her know what i needed from her. I immediately got ahold of the mortgage lender that was working with us, told him that we had a co-signer, and asked what we needed to get him. He told us, i passed the info to my mother, and that was that. I was so excited and happy and could have cried. It was such a great feeling. She told me she would get me all the needed papers the next day. All fine. 

Now comes today. I'm home with the kids, husband is at work, and i had just got a letter from my trailer park letting me know my water would be shut off for a while because a water line broke and they were trying to fix it. No idea when it would be turned back on. Great, fine. I'm looking forward to moving out and never looking back. Then i get a message from my mom. She says that she thought again about the whole co-signing thing, and that she didn't think she could do it. She had defaulted on a mortgage over 12 years ago and thought that would fuck up our chances of getting the loan. She didn't want her fuck up, to then fuck us up. I told her i wish she would have just said no yesterday. Then I did some research and it looked like, depending on the lender, that that wouldn't be a huge thing and could be worked around. I asked her if the mortgage guy said it was fine and not a problem, if she would still co-sign with us. She said no. 

She apologized, said she understood if i was angry, said i could unleash wrath (she actually said that) and that if there was any other way she could help that she would. I just told her that i loved her, that i would never unleash wrath or be angry towards her, but that i wish she would have just said no yesterday and now i dont know what to say to the realtor or the mortgage guy and that now I'm going to look worse to them. I didn't get angry at her, i didn't even tell her I'm angry, just kinda took the ""I'm not angry, just disappointed"" approach. I told her to have a good day, and that i now had to think about things. I know that she knows that I'm pissed, because she knows me, but i will never get angry at her. 

But I'm pissed. I can't help but be. This was our one way of getting out of this hellhole. I was finally looking forward to something for the first time in a long time. By the time we get our credit better, the house could be sold. And this is exactly what we had dreamed of. Now it just got yanked out from under my feet. I was happy. I was excited. Now i feel dead, and I'm stuck at home with my kids and i can't even talk to anyone about this because my husband is still at work for another 4 hours, and i can't even bring myself to message the realtor or the mortgage guy because i feel like I'm going to burst out crying everytime i try to text them. 

My little baby sleeping in my arms is the only thing stopping me from curling up into a ball and shutting out the rest of the world. I'm trying so hard right now to not listen to anything, while my head of screaming at me that i should just give up on trying to get the house, that we'll never move, and I'm going to remain stuck in this tiny little hellhole forever.

This is a throwaway, because I don't feel comfortable talking about it.

I finished school last year (IT administration, chosen by my dad) and now I feel lost, without a will to live. All my life was linked clearly for me, go to school, do chores, do sports, these lines were set in stones by my parents and I got used to them. But now, when I can pretty much do what I want, I have no idea what to do. I thought about trying going to college, but I don't know which college to choose, apart from sports and pc games, I never had any hobbies or interests and I fear I'd get kicked out because I never bothered to learn how to learn (if it makes any sense) I just never needed to study, I passed smoothly everything while spending most of my free time either playing floorball, walking other people's dogs or playing games. When I asked my parents (it would make sense, right? They know me the best) what do they think I should do, they just shrug and say that it's my life. 

Today I live in the top floor of their house, paying for water, electricity and heating, while working 12 hour shifts in a warehouse as a pc operator (basically I look at people moving boxes and if something gets lost, it's my job to find out who's responsible and if possible, find the material lost) with possible progress to regular network admin in time. People ask me if I like the job, I always nod, even though I don't know if I like anything anymore. I feel useless, without a purpose, lost, expendable, boring and dull, like the world would be better off without me. My parents are probably going to get divorced and my mom could've escaped this train wreck of a marriage way sooner, if she didn't have me. They say that they're trying to make it work, and not only because of me, but I'm not sure if I believe them. 

Relationship-wise I had only one gf so far, she was cute and madly in love with me (I still don't know why), but I sent her away, because I didn't want to bother her with my suicidal and depressive thoughts. I regret it every day, but at the same time, I couldn't stand to see someone get miserable with me. 

I'm starting to think that nothing really matters and really swinging towards the suicide escape. The only two things really holding me from trying it are my mother's and grandmother's affection towards me, I don't want to hurt them, but at the same time I don't want to be hurting anymore. I don't know where to turn, I tried a psychologist, but she just kept repeating that I should get out more. Which I hate, I hate meeting new people (even though it would probably hate, but the feeling of approaching someone just like that makes my spine twitch), I hate parties and large get togethers. 

I was playing with the thought of adopting a dog, to have a friend and someone who will listen about what hurts me, without just calling me lazy, but I would be the only one who would care for it. I don't want the dog to be alone for 13 hours at a time, I fear it would get depressed, or start destroying things out of boredom. Thoughts about starting a dating site were quickly tucked away, I get called charming and funny left and right, but I don't have any real hobbies, friends or interests and I'm afraid that I'm just a comedic relief in everyone's lives, a brief moment of haha that they forget and wouldn't mind, if the moment never existed. 

For a while now I'm getting afraid of drinking, because I fear that I might really try to take my life, if I lose bounds, that I feel are getting thinner and thinner, even without the influence of alcohol. This gives me the chills just because it would make my mom and grandma sad, I don't think I fear death anymore...

I love you and there’s nothing that can change that. 

It hurts like hell getting tossed around because you don’t want to be with me and you don’t want me anymore.

Why did you get back with me the second time? You could have left it what it was because we were broken up and just friends, but no. You told me you wanted me back in the middle of the night while I was asleep. For what? It only ended up fucking me up further in the long run. 

It hurts that you didn’t talk to me sooner, because maybe we could have fixed it. In early December when you started to have conflicting issues? Why didn’t you tell me? Why didn’t you think you can confide in me about that? What made me unapproachable about such things?

Im sorry that you stayed with me because you thought I was going to fall down into a depression. It’s going to happen eventually so I don’t know why you bothered.

When you said you cheated on me I was hurt. It made me feel jealous and depressed that you would go do something like that, and it just plain sucked. When you told me that was a lie, I felt somewhat relieved but still hurt because you still used that lie to get me to break up with you, and I returned to somewhat of the same jealous and depressed feelings when you told me you wanted someone else. 

I don’t want anyone else and there will likely never be a someone else in this town, so you shouldn’t have to worry about feeling the same way. 

I don’t know what else I can do or say to make you feel happy, and all I can say is I tried. I tried to cling onto what made me happy only to lose you quicker than I gained you. 

I thought we finally had something good going, and it saddens me that you don’t want that or me anymore. However I can’t control what you want, I can only try to cater to it.

If you want out then okay. You got your out. 

I enjoyed my time with you a lot and it truly made me happy. You were great and I enjoyed every time we were together, every time we talked on the phone, and every time we texted. I enjoyed the way you smiled and the way you laughed. I enjoyed the warmth I felt when I held you and the kiss when I said goodbye. I enjoyed the good morning texts and the texts that bade me goodnight.

Writing this has made me cry. For the first time in a long time. The last time was back in Florida, which was a while ago.

That means about 80% of my colleagues are male. I have not had to deal with much in the way of creepiness, just a few guys who I knew were into me who kind of subtly hinted as much but never made a move. So sure, I guess maybe I'm one of the lucky ones in that regard.

Something that pisses me off though is that ever since the MeToo stuff, there's all these stories about how women were pressured into sex by their bosses and apparently had no choice but to go along with it.

Now are these bosses creeps? Yeah. Is what they're doing wrong and should they be fired? Yeah.

But my issue is with the assumption that any woman in this situation would just go along with it. Uh no the fuck I wouldn't. No job is that important to me. If my boss told me I needed to blow him or I'd lose my job and he'd spread rumors about me, the first thing I would do is go straight to HR and report this.

Granted, it's different for a Hollywood actress and Harvey Weinstein, but I still don't buy the argument that these women had no choice. They chose fame and success over dignity and self-respect. They decided that being a famous actress at any cost was more important than potentially having to settle for a more normal life. It's shitty that they got put in that situation, but ultimately, they made a shitty choice. Lupita Nyong'o for example didn't make that choice and took the riskier road of saying no, and it seemed to work out fine for her.

Again, none of this means Harvey Weinstein isn't a creep and doesn't deserve everything he got. But for the women involved, like Rose McGowan, I don't buy that you're a victim or a hero for speaking out years later. You decided at the time that you would stay silent for the benefit of your Hollywood career, and then when your career prospects dried up, suddenly you're a victim.

Silenced, for talking about how my community sidelines and silences me. Real nice.

Posting from an alt because I don't want my main to be banned on trans subs.

To preface, my trans experience has been pretty 'standard.' I came out to myself seven years ago, and started hormones two years ago, then came out to everyone a few months later (I made a post and changed my Facebook over, to prevent an endless string of comings-out). My transition has always been about alleviating my dysphoria, trying to reach a point where my brain and body feel aligned, where I can move through life as a woman and see a woman in the mirror and not think about (ie be upset by) my body all the time, where I can just live in it passively and contently. Taking estrogen and antiandrogens has literally felt like having a working antidepressant, like a fog lifting.

The trans community seems to have gone in the exact opposite direction. It's now considered bigotry (and a bannable offense on many online groups and subreddits) to say that a person with no dysphoria and no desire for a bodily transition, who transitions only their social roles, is not in fact trans but a gender non-conforming cis person. For sharing the view (fact really) that, unless we get to sci-fi levels of medicine where for example cloning and body-switching are possible, I will always be male in certain unalterable ways, and everyone else (trans, intersex, or neither) will always have a body representing birth sex to some extent, regardless of any amount of synthetic body modification, I, a trans woman, have been called TERF and reductionist and told that my view 'leaves so many people behind.'

If that's the case, the people I'm leaving behind are *non-conforming cis people.* And I'm not even doing that, because I support their right to be non-conforming. I believe in annihilation of patriarchal norms and gender roles for both men and women, and abolition of gender as a construct. Everyone should be free to present themselves as they see fit, and to be non-conforming (or as the 'social role trans' crowd would say, non-binary) if that represents them. (Ironically, I *am* a radical feminist, and I'd probably hang around gendercritical if they weren't hateful of people like me and don't want me there, but that's a whole other topic.)

And then there's the whole confusing fetishistic side that's all about girldick and anime and the sexual euphoria of dressing or acting feminine, which seems to mostly be the non-dysphoric social role people. I suspect this crowd is also where a lot of the unproductive and terrifying violent speech about beating TERFs and killing transphobes comes from. But that's a messy issue to get into, especially since some genuine trans people who are confused and looking for community have no doubt been caught up in their fervor and influenced by it as well, so I'll just leave it at the fact that those people make me quite uncomfortable and give our community a bad image.

But for having these views, I'm classed as a bigot and a transphobe and 'truscum.' I'm made afraid to share my perspective for fear of being harassed, insulted, and tossed out of my own spaces of online support, and I have to carefully censor myself in what are supposed to be my safe spaces. 

In the interest of respecting mostly male crossdressers (the 'special queer girls' without dysphoria exhibit some of this too, but they don't seem to police others in the same way so much as seeking attention), people without dysphoria, who are proud of their dicks and their beards, who sexualize femininity and sometimes even revel in how uncomfortable they make others or how shocked girls are to see them in the restroom, and who have somehow become moderators and influential voices in trans online spaces, or, put another way, in the interest of respecting *highly sexual gender non-conforming cis males in a position of power over me,* I've lost my community and I've been forced to censor my voice, and I've watched people outside the community who don't see this divide become less supporting of my rights because of their actions.

To be clear, I'm not here to gatekeep. I'm not in peoples' heads and there are different ways of being trans. Being trans and being unable to pass is a real struggle, and I feel for those people and acknowledge the privilege I have to pass as a woman. Being medically or financially unable to access hormones or surgery or other ways to alleviate dysphoria and appear to others as your identified sex, again, is very hard and does not invalidate a person's innate transness, and as someone who is symptomatic of a medical condition which might prevent me getting bottom surgery, I truly empathize with those experiences. And I support actual non-binary trans people. Those who experience dysphoria about some sex characteristics but not others, people who want to take hormones but to appear to themselves and others as androgynous, or who want some changes but not others (ie wanting to keep their genitals but alter their chest or vice versa), things in that vein are inherently trans experiences. And given that research is starting to show that sex differences in the brain correlating with identified sex are partially or fully present in the brains of transgender people, it makes total sense to me that some people would fall more on the partially side and have a non-binary rather than binary female or male expectation of their own bodies.

But people who experience none of these things, who desire no bodily transition, who are comfortable in and proud of their bodies, and who want to transition only in terms of clothes, makeup, hair, and social roles are gender-nonconforming, not trans. They have no place claiming they are not bodily the sex they were born into (a claim even I don't make, again aside from brain anatomy), and their demands to be recognized fully as sexes they are not even partially and allowed to access the corresponding spaces, and to be treated earnestly as genders they wear as costumes (or given new sets of pronouns other than she/he/they which have little to do with gender expression and everything to do with seeming unique) are not only deeply entitled and groundless, but make life harder for me, and for nonpassing trans people especially, and for non-conforming cis people who recognize themselves as such.",True,False,[],False,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,463574,public,self,"I'm a trans woman, and I'm scared of what my community has become.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/ejgo39/im_a_trans_woman_and_im_scared_of_what_my/,no_ads,0.0

My mom was gone but she has to work anyway so that didn’t bother me. But the dog was missing. My mom ended up getting home super early and I asked her where the dog was, and she just told me “not here”. I pressed her and then she told me she noticed a weird bump on his leg and took him to the vet and they put him down.


What upset me is she took off work to do this and also her ex boyfriend who used to spend time with the dog went with her (why him and not me). So clearly she knew she was putting the dog down. So why would she not just tell me she was going to do that. Like give me a heads up so I could say good bye instead of doing it behind my back and blindsiding me.


I confronted her about this and her story changed several times about why she didn’t tell me. First she was saying she thought the vet would be routine and she had no idea, then she was saying she had suspicions but she was too afraid to tell us and didn’t know what to do. Then she was trying to tell me that I had been going through a lot and she “didn’t think I could handle this right now”.


That pisses me off so badly, deciding for me that I “can’t handle it” and then putting the dog down behind my back without telling me. My mom would then SOB over dramatically and come into my room and say things like “you know I was his favorite” and “we should make shirts with his face on it”. SHUT THE FUCK UP. The nerve to cry so hard to me while I sit there blankly after telling me I couldn’t handle it.

However, as an Iraqi, I can attest that the “attack” was done by Iraqi protesters themselves without the involvement of Iran, and that this is just another false accusation. The protesters are supporters of Hezbollah, a group supported by Iran, however, the protest is in the interests of the Iraqi protests, and Iran has nothing to do with it, and the general of Iran is unlikely to have commanded an attack at the embassy. For example, if a bunch of Germans like McDonalds, it doesn’t mean they are supported by Americans, they just enjoy the big macs over their sausages. Anyways, Israel has been trying to dismantle the Iranian government for years now, accusation after accusation got them nowhere because Iran has a decent military compared to our weakened military after the Iran-Iraq war and gulf war. Israel wanted to destabilize Iraq because it saw it as a threat to their state, and thus came up with many accusations against Iraq which were supported by the US, such as the obtainment of weapons of mass destruction. They also used the gulf war as a chance to invade and destabilize Iraq. To most Iraqis this is clear and the reason why we are not fond of Israel, and I ask people to understand the subject and look at the situation from our shoes. Even if there is a small involvement of Iran in Iraq, this is minuscule compared to the influence of the US in Iraq and every other country other than North Korea (although they’re trying). It is not a coincidence that every U.S president and general has close relations to Israel, just search “Donald Trump Israel” or Robert O’brian Israel”, etc, and that most of your media is ran/supported by Jewish individuals.

Her parents were so happy that we got together and so were mine. 
For so many years, everyone asked us to get married but we took our time for one reason or the other. Everyone gave up on us getting married and it was quickly forgotten. 
Then came the we should have a baby talk. Especially her parents and more specifically her dad. He would always mention it one way or the other. But not in a naggy way, but somehow dropped as a joke sort of stuff. It was clear that he wanted to have a grandkid. And he kept insisting for another seven years, until last year. 
We when up to her parents house and we sat everybody down(my parents were there too) and we broke the news. We were pregnant.
I will never forget everyone’s screams and joyous laughters. More so, her dad. I don’t know when he had the time to do all that, but there was a huge party at their house(caterers and even a music band). It was a bit over board,that it kinda made us feel uncomfortable. But she was his only daughter and he was a bit well off,, so none of my business. 
But anyways, pregnancy was good and I everything was going according to plan. Family was heavily involved as well. Around 7 months, we had to go to London as my wife was British and we had to ride the free health care train.
Two months we stayed in London and everything was well and come January 15 we had a beautiful baby boy. Everyone was so happy and we were in tears. We heard they had another huge party back home and that everyone was excited to see the new addition to the family. 
We tried to get back home sooner but the Home Office told us that a child needs to stay alive for 45 days before they could issue a passport under British law, so we had to stay in London. 
I remember that day I got the phone call. January 22. It was exactly a week after we had our son. It was 3 am UK time. It was my girls brother and he told me to leave the bedroom and talk to him. I knew by the sound of his voice that it was something serious. He started crying over the phone and I started panicking. It took him about 10 minutes to tell me that my father in law had passed away due to a car accident. I was in shock and I just didnt know what to do. No tears or anything, just pure shock and paralyzed. Her brother told me that I have to tell my girl and that was the heaviest thing I’ve ever done in my life.
I sat in a dark living room, just crying and thinking how I was going to break the news to her. It was just too painful. And it was more painful to think that the one person who had wanted a grandson and the one person who was persistent for years and the one person that was the most happiest and couldn’t wait to hole his grandson has passed away without holding him. That thought still weighs heavy on me. 
I stayed in the living room for 5 hours and it was morning already. Baby was awake and crying and she was feeding him. She immediately knew there was something wrong, cuz my eyes were all swollen. I then sat down and took the baby from her and tearfully told her what had happened. That scream. That wail . It was just too awful and I run out of the room as I couldn’t have our son hear all that. My baby was also crying with all that happening and I think he just sensed the sadness.
I then called some her friends and told them what had happened. Bless them! They came as fast as they could. 
Then came the other shock, the home office had told us that our baby can’t get a passport until he’s 45 days old and that means she can’t even go to her own fathers funeral. And the baby is just one week old and she has to be with him all the time. I haven’t taught of that earlier but when I found out, I was just heartbroken and I really felt for her and I still do till this day. I went to the Homeoffice that very same day and I explained to them the situation and they told me they couldn’t help me. I tried everything I could, to have my girl be present at her fathers funeral, but to no avail. 
She then insisted that I go instead and that I should tell her everything about the funeral. To  eave my girl after a week of giving birth, after breaking the news of her fathers death is probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done and will ever do in my life. 
I reported everything about the funeral as best as I could. And even foolishly took some pictures, but later refrained from sendin them to her as that wouldn’t help anybody. 
I write this today because, it will be a year in exactly 17 days time and that thought came to me.
To finish it off with something nice, Our son is growing too and he is so cute and we love both love him to much🥰

My childhood before 13 is in pieces I can count on two hands, before 11 is only one. Because you abused me. 

Yelling, hitting, neglect. Fear isn't the way to raise a child. Pain isn't.

Yet I have memories like when I sobbed for two hours when I was eleven, because I asked you for some money and you told me we wouldn't be able to eat if you gave it to me, but you still forced me to buy the fucking candy with it. 

I still love you, after you backhanded me for missing my bus and getting on the wrong bus with a friend, because his mom would give me a ride home when I was six. 

I still love you after you made your ten year old walk seven fucking blocks, which felt so mich bigger, to the store because you forgot to buy dinner and my brothers needed fed.

I still love you even though I didn't eat that night. 

And yes, I still fucking love you after you almost drove me to suicide, because I wanted to be happy and live with my Dad. 

I hate myself for saying it, but I still love you after you gave me a shitty childhood from what I do remember, and holding me and my brother like a trophy. Out of spite. So my Dad couldn't have his kids.

I have tinnitus and it makes me hear very badly, I often can't hear what others say, and because of it I have gotten lower scores in hearing tests and completely dropped out of conversations because I couldn't hear what the other said.

I study economy in HS and am having strong second thoughts about it because science subjects are my stronger side.

My brother got engaged to his girlfriend of 2 years a month ago and told the family in a group text. Since first meeting his fiancée, I have tried to get to know her and be friendly, but there has been zero reciprocation. 

When my brother met her, we went from seeing each other weekly to only on special occasions. Last Christmas and the Christmas before, I spent a lot of time choosing a gift for her, although I didn’t see her at Christmas either year (I moved overseas 6 months ago and couldn’t travel home this Christmas). 

I wrote a message to her and my brother to thank them for my Christmas gift that my parents brought with them, and got no response from her. 

Despite the fact we work in similar fields, she does not engage me in conversation about it. I get the strong feeling that she feels her education/credentials are better than mine. At best, she just doesn’t care about my thoughts on any subject. 

She has never asked me a question about myself or my SO (who I live with). When she comes to family events, she makes no effort to talk to anyone about my brother. I have sat in the car with them for over 3 hours while they talked about their friends, and she did not once acknowledge me. 

I feel like I’m losing my mind. My brother is insanely sensitive about the family not liking her or not making enough of an effort, so I can’t bring this up to him. 

I’ve never seen her be affectionate toward my brother or put forth any effort to do anything for him. All of their special dates (that I know of) have been planned and financed by him. He seems to think she is doing him a favor if she bothers to come to any family event.

I'm now taking antidepressants and am suffering from its side effects (super suicidal, loss of appetite, mood swings,...).
So yesteday my sad and drugged monkey brain thought it would be a great idea to cut myself with a razor (I've been cutting myself for two years but I've only used very dull knifes so that I'd have to try hard to make a deep cut- and of course feel more pain in the process). So i took appart a razor and wanted to make a small cut on my wrist. But since i've never used a razor I decided to make a test cut on my upper arm. Of course it made a deeeep cut and i started bleeding really badly. After realizing what happened I started hyperventilating and crying like a waterfall and thinking what the fuck is wrong with my life. 
I sat on my bed emotionless for about 20minutes, holding the cut together with my arm. Finally I felt good enough to realize that i need to go get the wound stitched. I put my greasy hair in a bun,hopped into my car, smelling like garbage since I haven't showered in 3days, put Celine Dion on and went to the ER.
Around 1hour had passed and it was finally my turn to get checked. They num my arm and started stitching it. And thank god they didn't ask too many questions about how it happened.
But of course the universe decided that this wasn't entertaining enough so I started feeling dizzy. Since the doctor was almost done I didn't say anything which was a mistake because as soon as I stood up I fucking fainted cuz of my loss of appetite and loss of blood. I woke up with nurses all around me, asking me if I was alright. I told them yes even though my pride and ego were badly dammaged. I had to wait for half an hour and they finally let me go home where I looked in the mirror and froze. I went to the ER with hair, dripping with oil, puffy eyes, no fucking bra and a shirt covered in blood stains and goulash.

I’m trying to find the perfect ring.

You want a lab-grown diamond. I love that.

You want the jeweler to give back to the community and/or people from the countries where diamonds are mined from. I love that too.

You don’t want me to pull a loan for this ring. I completely understand.

But understand that although these diamonds are cheaper, they are still. Not. Cheap.

I have a job that barely gets me by. I have bills to pay. I don’t have the financing to even pay off my credit card debt without getting a small personal loan to consolidate it with. With all of that, I’m barely saving to get something special for the proposal. You know all of this. When we talk about our finances, you know how much I make, how much I spend on bills, and how much I’m able to save. 

But..whenever we talk about ring and your preferences..you want flawless, colorless, ideal cut diamonds that are way over what I can afford. You showed me a site that had your filters set already. It was way over what I had been searching for. Almost double. And it scared the shit out of me. 

I understand that this ring is something that’s truly special and incredibly meaningful. I want to get you the ring of your dreams. But it makes it so hard when even though you understand the position I’m in..you have such high expectations for this. And it’s crushing me. 

I wish you said that even a shitty ring would do. Or that it didn’t matter what the ring looked like before you showed me what you were looking for. Now I feel like I’m not enough to get a ring that isn’t what you want. Almost like you’re disappointed to hear me say “I’m really sorry, but I can’t afford that..” 

I know I’m taking this too personally. I also know that I’m overthinking this. I know you didn’t mean anything wrong. I know that you have feelings too, and of course you have high expectations. It’s an engagement ring. One of the most important question of our lives. You deserve the best, and it makes me incredibly sad to know that I can’t afford to give that to you.

I asked her out on Instagram kinda positive she would say yes, and she did. First date was cool we made out sorta awkwardly. She is 5'9"" and I'm 6ft so it felt unnatural kissing someone my height but that would never get in the way of my pride or anything. Second date we gave each other head but didn't go farther than that. Third date she warned me she was on her period but I wanted to spend new years with her so we just made out without shirts on sorta night. And toasted the new years away. Tonight we hung at her place, took her dog on a walk, and smoked a joint. Then I think things became awkward. And we both admitted to being too high and I said something like hey let's be real we are obviously super awkward with each other and talked about how this is kind of a first for the both of us; Usually hooking up by the second date at the latest with our past relationships. We talked more about it, and had a bit of an awkward goodbye. I feel kinda weird about it now I realize I was just trying to stick around because I was just physically attracted to her. Not reallly emotionally. And I didn't think I was that type of person so it's good to realize that now. Still a sad situation tho. But I'm happy we could be nice to each other about it.

I started talking early, started reading early, etc and every adult in my life; my parents, my grandparents, the little old ladies at my church; all of them told me I was smart. I was told that so much that I guess at some point I started thinking of myself as ""The smart kid.""

Then, in first grade, I was diagnosed with Dyscalculia , a learning disability that affects my brains ability to comprehend numbers and general math, much in the same way dyslexia affects comprehension of letters and general language. It was so severe that I was placed in No Child Left Behind.

Now, let me start off by saying that, as a whole, I think from first hand experience that NCLB isnt as bad as people say. The classes where smaller, I got help that I genuinely needed, and I honestly think that, without it, I would've dropped out. But there where some downsides too. From my experience, only about 5% of kids actually need to be in there, the rest are the kids who's parents wont let them drop out so they just dont pay attention. We were constantly being yelled at for some stupid thing or another.

Another downside was it made me self-conscience. By pure coincidence, all of my really close friends where in the gifted program. Even though I know they never where, I still to this day sometimes wonder if they think less of me because of my disability. I was terrified of kids from my regular classes finding out I was in NCLB and assuming I was disabled. I was in constant fear that whatever girl I was drooling over that week would see me in the NCLB classroom and treat me differently. 

And, lastly, it gave me self-esteem issues. By far the biggest issue is that, at least in my school, the NCLB staff treats its kids like complete idiots. They insist that they help you with every little thing, an hover over you constantly. Like I said, I have a genuine learning disability, and I absolutely wouldn't have graduated HS without the extra math help, but everything else was just too much. I suppose after a certain point, I began to believe them. I came to think I WAS stupid. I stopped trying. I coasted through the last three years of high school and avoided college. What was the point? I was too stupid for college. For years, I was terrified to try anything new, purely out of fear that I would fail.

Edit: sorry about the formatting, mobile

I’m the worst person I know. The first thing I do when I meet a new person is focus on what I perceive to be their worst aspects, how they dress, how they speak, how they carry themselves. Superficial things like that. Then I go on to make guesses (that have VERY SHALLOW evidence) about their personality, and what their like.  Then I put whatever cheap label I see fit on them and put them in a category. I place them in category only considering their worst aspects generally. I do all of this before even speaking to a person, before I know really anything about them. I reduce people in my mind into nothing but a label, I honestly think I do thins because my wimpy little brain cant handle understanding the fact that people are complex and are way more than they initially appear to be. I focus only on the worst things about a person to feel better about myself. I walk into conversations with people I do not know with baseless assumptions about them. I can think of 100 insult before I can even come up with 1 compliment. Im disgusting. 
	
The worst part about this is that my judgmental behavior also extends to my friends. In my mind I’m criticizing and making assumptions about people who have been nothing but kind to me, people who have always been there for me , people who care about me.  It’s not like there’s anything extraordinary or amazing about me that would allow me to look down on others. All of my friends are smarter and harder working then I am, and probably ever will be. I’m a procrastinator.  I’m the type of person who gives up on something because they couldn’t get it the first time, the kind of person who thinks “It’s destined to fail so why bother”.
	
I probably do this because I’m an insecure loser. If someone has something about them that is better than me then I point out a fault about them in my brain to make myself feel better. “Oh that person is thinner than me, but they also have a larger nose than I do”, that kind of thing. It’s pathetic and I know it. The way I think about other people has become so normal for me that it only ever hits me how pitiful it is when I’m thinking about it before I go to sleep. It’s nauseating to think that the only reason I have any confidence whatsoever is because I had to put down other people in my mind to get it. I sound like one of the mean girls.
	
I never actually say any of the negative things I think about people out loud, especially not to their face. I try not to be the person who says horrible things about others behind their backs.
	For my New Years resolution I’m going to try and write down only nice things about other people at least once or twice a week, hopefully more.

I’m so sorry if my post hurts anyone. I know mental health is something a lot of people struggle with, but please just let me vent. 

My friend’s whole personality is her anxiety. She is obsessed with telling people she has anxiety. I’m not saying she should keep it a secret but for goodness sake she makes a post everyday on social media about it. People comment all the time telling her to stay strong and push through. Maybe I am just being insensitive but it’s starting to all look like a pity party. I used to be one of those people. I’d write paragraphs for her. When we got together for dinner I’d listen to her, then comfort her.

But it’s the same cycle everyday. Now when she opens her mouth I just want to scream and tell her shut the f up. She never lets anyone talk without reverting the subject back to herself. One time I tried telling her about the promotion I got at work. Instead of congratulating me she made me feel bad cause she hated her job and it gave her anxiety. When I got engaged and told all my friends, she again made it about herself by saying something like “when will her bf ever buy a ring for her...? Maybe never...maybe he doesn’t love her...oh...her anxiety is getting to her...” 

I feel emotionally exhausted when I have to listen to her or see her posts about anxiety. I don’t care about her anxiety. I wish she would just stop. It’s ruining our friendship.

I'm really disturbed and a little afraid of all the positive portrayal of trans figures in the media. And the reason is because I'm scared of what would've happened to me if the media landscape and society was like this when I was younger. And I'm scared of what it's doing to people like me right now. 

I have a slight case of autism, only diagnosed 3 years ago (33 right now). I always felt like I wasn't like the other kids, I liked to keep on my own and interacting with others was something I just didn't have a need for. Sure having friends, people you can rely on is useful, but making friends how do you do that? ""Simply talk to people"", what's simple about talking to people when there isn't an obvious topic that warants talking to someone to begin with, a clear function. I'm getting a bit side-tracked here, but I had some problems with communication and one other problem, which comes into play with the topic: dealing in absolutes and rules.

This has gotten better as an adult, but let me give you an example. When I was 5 or 6 years old, while staying with my grandmother for lunch, she told me (paraphrasing) ""You should save some meat for the last bite"". She said that once and she meant that meat was the core of a dish and the most flavourful. So saving a morsel for last, you can finish on a flavourful note. As a result of this once-said phrase, for years I never touched the meat on my plate until I finished all the vegetables. Even now I still struggle with breaking this weird eating habbit. There are other examples as well but more examples don't have anything to do with the point I want to make.

So where does the transgender thing fit in? If someone had pointed at young me and gotten the idea that my weird behaviour might be linked to being transgender for some reason, it would've taken very little effort to force that idea into my head, even with seemingly bening phrases. And I'm still strugling with a weird but harmless eating habit after all these years, what would a mind-fuck like this have done to me? As an adult I don't have any doubts about my cis-gender status, but as a child I would've had no mental defence against this. I admit, there's no guarantee that things would've unfolded in reality as I'm imagining here. But there are studies showing a link between autism and gender dysphoria. Not to mention news articles of a rise in transgender children in schools, with teachers coming forward that they're actually children with signs of autism.

I know all of this is stemming from a scenario I made up in my head ""Had this happened, in this situation, then this result would've followed"". But regardless, I now have this real fear and hatred of a transgender recruiter who doesn't care about helping children, but only cares about pumping up the number of ""transgender kids I've helped come to terms with their true identity"" so he can feel good about himself.

I don't know if recruiters like that really exist, but in my eyes, they're worse than pedophiles; the mental scars they inflict are just as bad, the physicals scars from correcting your body to the right gender are worse, and you don't even get the recognition and sympathy a victim of molestation gets, just a society that keeps on repeating that your mental scars are your true self.

This last paragraph will include more of my opinion, as opposed to the blend of personal experience, facts and imagined scenarios of the last paragraphs. I don't know what truely causes a person to become transgender. I believe there are 2 ways which exist besides each other. One is a born transgender, the part of their brain that governs self-identification of gender is inherently oposite to biological sex. The second is a learned transgender, a person who doesn't feel right in their skin, who an unknown \*something\* happening in their brain and that something just latches onto an idea as the cause. It could be that they consider themselves to fat and weight loss will fix them, or it could be that gender is the wrong thing that they need to fix. And that idea reinforces itself a little more every time the person has that idea. There is a reason I also included anorexia in this example because it ties in with the media. Fashion designers and media got a lot of crap for showing thin models because it could induce a distorted self-image in people leading to anorexia, but to me it seems like showing transgender people in the media can induce a distorted self gender-image, but no one's cathing any flak for that.

This turned out to be a lot longer than it was in my head. Also I realise that my strongest emotional respons stems from an imaginary scenario, but doesn't seem out of the realm of real possibility. So I feel my emotional response shouldn't be counted as invalid.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Trans-positive society scares me because I feel my mild autism would've left me vulnerable as a child to having gender dysphoria induced in me, with all the mental and physical dificulties that would've entailed. I fear society, might delude itself into thinking they're doing the right thing in ""helping kids come to terms with their true gender"", not caring that autistic children are hurt by these practices. And finally I feel like the media should be held accountable for inducing gender dysphoria in the same way as they were for anorexia nervosa.",True,False,[],False,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,463214,public,self,The popularity of trans-inclusivity in society and the media really disturbs me for personal reasons.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/ej7qnk/the_popularity_of_transinclusivity_in_society_and/,no_ads,0.0

It coincided with a sort of bout of depression after finishing high school. I mean, it was weird. It’s like the intensity of my emotions diminished tenfold and everything felt a bit flat. Still does at times. I freaked out at first and then just went on with life, as I figured it was part of becoming an adult.

But my sex drive is something I miss. I remember always being horny before. I remember it was easy to get aroused and that I liked how it felt. But now my body doesn’t respond. It doesn’t respond to fantasies, to my partner doing stuff, to porn, it doesn’t respond to anything at all. I’m always dry and never tingly. I’ve been faking orgasms with all my partners since I was 18.

It sounds pathetic. I’ve always hoped that it’ll come back just as it left. I talked to my doctor about this once and he said it was probably psychological. I’m not sure... I’m afraid to go to therapy. It’s just so embarrassing. I can’t really talk about this with anyone, it’s my deepest secret that I haven’t even told my best friend about.

Worst thing is I have partner with a high sex drive, really, really high. He wants sex all the time, he’s very physical. In the beginning I was more into it, you know the newness makes hormones run wild and even though I didn’t get actually aroused I did feel enough of whatever to make having sex easy. But now years have gone by, the newness is gone and I struggle because all I wish is I could actually get wet and horny. I wish I could enjoy sex as much as he does. I wish I didn’t have to fake my orgasms.

And I feel so guilty. He probably deserves someone better, someone who basically isn’t lying to him. But I’ve lied to all my partners about it. It’s not them anyway, it’s me. I’m afraid if I tell him he’ll think it’s him, and truly it’s not.

But our relationship is otherwise a dream. I sometimes want sex because of intimacy, not arousal, but not all the time like he does. I don’t feel sexy either... he’s always going on about how I should be more confident and act more confident when having sex but I just can’t see myself as sexy.

I hate this. We had an argument a while ago because we were having sex and he felt I was pressuring him to cum (he sometimes holds it and I know that makes it harder for him to cum, so I told him not to hold it, and he was upset). 

I miss sex, it feels so distant when I could get aroused easily, I enjoyed it a lot and it frustrates me that it’s not like I’m asexual, because I really do want to have sex and enjoy it, it’s not like I never wanna have sex anymore.

Born male, still male. But ever since middle school, I've found that I wanted to be female. I fantasized about switching bodies with women, about waking up as a woman, getting turned into a woman. Heck, even a Doctor Who style dying and getting regenerated as a woman. Didn't talk to anyone about those at the time and just hoped it was something I'd grow out of. ...but I didn't. It stuck around and kept growing. When I got a job, I spent some money on women's clothes that I'd keep in my car. I used that FaceApp app all the time, collecting a wider and wider variety of pictures of the woman I thought I wanted to be. I've started wondering if I'm suffering from Gender Dysphoria. The thing is... I don't want to be. Ignoring my religious objections, I don't think that it'd work. I don't think becoming a woman would help me in any way. I'm not interested in typical feminine things, so I'd pretty much be living as a guy with breasts. I'm positive that I wouldn't be happier. Heck, I don't even think I'd be able to pass as a woman. Plus I'd end up regretting it later. If you're trans, or considering it, I'm not saying you're wrong for doing so. I just don't believe it's right for me. The problem is that I don't feel safe talking about this to anyone. If I talked to someone I know, that'd change the way they saw me. Even if I told them that that's not who I want to be, that would always be something tied to my personality in their mind. (I did somehow manage to bring this topic up with my friend without him realizing I was talking about me... as far as I know, and he pretty much confirmed my fears.) And I feel even less safe talking about it to my therapist. She's been great helping me deal with some of the stress and anxiety that I've had for years, especially the stuff I got from working retail, but I'm worried if I brought it up she'd try and convince me to transition. Try and make me be ""comfortable as the woman I was always meant to be"". That's not what I want, though. I want to be comfortable as the *man I was born as*. That's who I was meant to be. I don't want acceptance, I want help. I just don't know where I can find that help when the only solution I see people talking about is to transition and have done with it.

That was more ramble-y than I had hoped, and I'm still probably forgetting something.

In them 2 years of sixth form, they were probably the worst 2 years of my life in terms of how I felt. Suicidal thoughts here and there (still get them sometimes like ""what's the point might as well kill myself"") and somehow I made a facade to pretend I felt ok at school and at home then I would cry myself to sleep because having no confidence in yourself and in anything really sucks. I had to stop doing the only thing I was good at (darts) because of A levels which I really wanted to do well to get into a top notch university (got rejected by Oxford which sucked), so at this point I wasn't good at anything. 

I had crushes on 2 girls during sixth form- 1 being a girl who applied to oxford like I did so we went to meetings and stuff together she's lovely and the other being a girl in my friend group (I'll get on to that) and she is so cute it's unbearable, but because of not having ANY self confidence (autism doesn't help with this either) I was just like ""eh I'm not good enough for them I'll not say anything"" and now the first one is pretty much out of my life and the second one is sort of I'm regretting everything. But my pussy ass bitch self won't do anything about it, coz I don't deserve them anyway. I'm probably gonna be a virgin forever but oh well ig.

The friend group I mentioned is a group of 4, 2 guys 2 girls even tho it seems to just be the lads and the girls separated (the girls were at a 80s new year party and didn't bother to invite us 2 lads so I've pretty much just given up on them) and, even tho they are the only friends I have at home, I don't really have them and I don't deserve them anyway.

Now I got good grades at Sixth Form and doing Physics at one of the top unis in England so that's cool and I'm trying my hardest to open up more and become ""me"" who I haven't really been coz I've kept some things hidden to not get bullied or humiliated, but there is still the issue with the self confidence and I'm scared it will never leave. Now I'm at home for Xmas and new year (going back in a week) all the negative thoughts have come back *especially after seeing crush number 2 again and not being invited to that NYE party- and new year kiss would've been cool ig* and the suicidal thoughts are more prominent again. I hope they leave when I get back to uni.

He currently works as a manager in food service, and while he knows he doesn’t want to do that anymore, he isn’t sure what he does want to do. He spent a few years in college before dropping out for this same reason (also, he hated school). He changed his major 3 times just to try to graduate earlier than anticipated and ended up dropping out because he was so over not knowing what he wants to do and spending thousands of dollars trying to figure it out.

He is very happy when he’s at home. We both consider work to be what we do to make money to survive and not necessarily anything else.

I have an, to be honest, asshole of an aunt. She knows/taught herself IT in the 90s and is successful in that field without a college degree. I had to go to her house this week to have her fix a computer issue I had, and during my time there she seriously asked me if my husband is depressed because he doesn’t know what he wants to do for a living. She also nagged me about his dropping out of college, as if it was my decision. It was especially frustrating because she also doesn’t have a degree and is living proof you don’t need one to be successful. Also, watching him make the difficult decision to drop out was not easy and not a choice he made lightly.

He is not depressed. He just isn’t one of those people who is defined and driven by what he wants to do to earn money. I’m also in a job that I wouldn’t call my dream career, and instead of spending time hating my job and looking for another one I just separate work from the rest of my life and only consider my job the place where I earn a paycheck. That doesn’t bother me at all, and in fact it makes me feel like I have an actual work/life balance that is healthy for me. 

I said something along the lines of: “I think he’s one of those types of people who doesn’t want his career to define him,” and she responded by clicking her tongue and rolling her eyes. She’s so holier-than-thou and operates under the mindset that you’re doing something wrong if you’re not living your life the way she thinks you should. It’s a chronic mindset she’s had her whole life, and she’s been alone for most of her life because of that reason. She can be insufferable to be around.

Everything would be easier if she minded her own business, but I can’t get over the implication that my husband is DEPRESSED because he doesn’t love working in food service.

So yeah. Pretty much the title. We were one big group of friends and I loved it, we gamed together, played together and they were my support network. But like always then there were arguments and they migrated into two groups overnight. Whilst I was fucking asleep.


I woke up from a message from the guy who runs the discord that said ""anyone who is in contact with these people or in the new clan will be banned from our group"".
So I created a separate account to hang out with all my friends. What I didn't expect were there to be spies from the original group. I was summarily banned from the original clan with no warning nor apology.
Enter shitty luck. I'm ill for a couple of weeks. Whilst I'm ill my google account gets hacked and my email used and a bunch of my accounts closed and by the time I realise it's too late.
So I go what the hell and make a new discord account and join the server that I wasn't banned from. Same username, different email.

The moment I join back and explain what happened I'm kicked and banned. No reason given. I fucking hate people.

So yeah. All my online friends and my entire support network has left me and I have no words.

They were my lifeline, my only friends anywhere and now they've just shunned me. I joined the group in the first place to keep my thoughts off of darker things, and it worked and I felt happy for a while and now I have nothing left.

I'd love to see more people from my background on tv and in movies. However, I don't want it to be forced. I usually find the implementation of a lot of diversity to be handled extremely poorly. If you have to announce your new black, hispanic or transgender character as a marketing ploy ''look at how inclusive we are'' then I'm already rolling my eyes. Whats wrong with just writing such a character, having their own flaws and strengths and me just viewing them as a regular character in  movie/tv show without overloading me with marketing surrounding those character beforehand. I need to see 20 articles a week about how Kevin Feige has hinted at a Transgender character in an upcoming movie. Why do such things have to be announced? Just write the damn character and let them behave like a normal human being in the movie without trying to make a whole woke statement. 

The real ''woke'' thing to do is to handle those characters just like how you handle your white male characters. I never heard Captain America have a ''boy power'' line in any of the Captain America movies. While the team up of all female superheroes in Endgame needed such a line. ''Don't worry she's got help.'' With conveniently all female characters showing up to help. That's the forced thing that makes my eyes roll. Why can't you just show Captain Marvel kick some ass, Scarlett Witch kick some ass, Wasp kick some ass etc. and when you do a team up shot you can have loads of female characters in there with some some equal amount of guys, because you know, equality is things being equal. 

Remember Sarah Connor or Ripley? Sarah underwent a traumatic experience in T1, had her whole inner struggle at the beginning of T2 and grow into becoming a very strong PERSON. They never shed a big light on her being a woman. She never had a scene like the Terminator not being able to defend himself and her saying something like ''I guess you needed a woman's touch'' while she blows him away with a rocket launcher. Or an other character saying something like ''I needed help from him'' and her popping up and saying ''But you're getting help from HER'' while blasting all her guns. Imagine Ripley fighting an alien and making a reference pro abortion rights. A tongue in cheek joke somewhere regarding the alien laying eggs in someone. 

Those female characters are regarded as some of the best and they never had this type of forced writing like modern day female characters have. They also seem to want to write PERFECT women without any flaws. Like how a Rey in the Star Wars movies. It's also noticeable in tv shows like Supergirl where Kara nearly breaks a guards arm because he touched her. Why did he touch her? Because Kara was trespassing into private property. Somehow the writers made a girl power moment out of that by standing up to her male oppressor.... while she was the one trespassing and the guy was just doing his job by removing her from there. Also look at the whole female Ghostbusters movie debacle. They even tried to spin the dislike towards that movie as ''men hating women'' In the end when you analyze (which people have done) you'll end up with 0.8% negative comments on it's trailer. Meanwhile headlines about it talked about massive hate and people brigading it's trailer. Redlettermedia did a video about it. It's one of their ''Scienceman'' videos.  So it also doesn't help when the media are making it very ''you're either with us or against us''. Dislike a movie with a woman in it? You must be a hater! Just look at the terrible girl power lines Jennifer Lawrence had in the previous X-Men movies. It's all so amazingly awkward. 

They just go way too far with their desperate attempts at diversity and writing strong diverse characters. A lot of the older diverse characters found their strengths in also having flaws and overcoming them. That's also what makes a character interesting. I would love seeing people from my minority represented in movies and shows, but I'm hesitant because they would just end up making us look back by forcing us in like some sort of know it all mary sue type characters. Just write people, write a human, don't set out to write a STRONG BLACK WOMAN. Just write a strong person and through her actions in the movie she will be loved as a great character.

But for some reason, I thought it was really fun and interesting. So I took the actual intro class for CS majors.

But got a 100 on pretty much all the assignments, a 100 on the project, and a 100 on the final. My parents were thrilled and told everyone their daughter is going to major in CS and get a good job.

But I always feel stupid. I felt like everyone in the class was smarter than me. Also, I heard my professor is one of the easier graders.

The final (and all exams) are curved so my raw score probably wasn’t 100 (although I won’t be able to see it since it was the final).

I forgot to take my meds today and it’s too late to take them now, so I’ve just been everywhere with my head and talk a lot.

“She just doesn’t shut up, does she?”

“Haha yeah, she just keeps going! We can’t get a word in.”

I didn’t mean to.. I was just really excited to see them.. I was happy. I was really happy. But those comments just shot me in the chest and I had to work really hard not to start crying. I let my dad take over. I stopped talking completely because I knew if I did I would cry, and they got mad at me for not “taking a joke”.

It’s just, every time I’m happy, I talk a lot. That’s just the way I am. I don’t interrupt people, I don’t overtake them, I wait until someone’s finished, so what’s the problem? It’s always been like this. I feel comfortable with someone so my brain turns off my “limiters” and I just go. With people I’m not comfortable around or know would get annoyed I just keep my mouth shut and live in my head until they’re gone. 

I just want someone to accept me. Who understands that I’m everywhere sometimes, even on my meds. That me talking a lot to them means I really enjoy being around them. I don’t mean any harm. I get why I need to be as normal as possible at work or school and I can do it well, but when I’m around family? Why can’t I be myself? Why can’t I take a break from those exhausting limiters in an attempt to appear 100% normal? I’m not normal, I have ADHD, I get that I can’t let it rule my life and in professional/social situations I have to keep it on the down-low but, why can’t my own family just let me be me? 

They wonder why I spend so much time in my room. I just talk to myself. It’s relaxing because I can just keep going as long as I want without worrying someone’s going to get annoyed with me. I can be myself when I’m alone, faking it is so fucking tiring. I hate it. If I can’t be normal then I just want to be accepted in my own home. I just want to feel accepted. I want it so bad.. I’m so tired of faking and feeling like being different is a bad thing. I’m constantly tired 24/7, while also full of the same level of energy that a 7 year old boy has. I’m tired because I can’t let that energy out. I exercise but it’s still there. It’s like it’s in a bottle in my chest, and talking is the only way it comes out. My mind is always going. There’s always something going on in my head and I can’t turn it off. The meds help, but it’s days that I forget them that I’m reminded of how hard it is. 

I’m exhausted and you know what? I’m fucking sick of faking who I am. I’m tired of being seen as the annoying hyper girl. If you don’t like it then just don’t try to be my friend. I don’t need friends who don’t like the real me. If I have to fake it around you then you’re an exhausting person and I don’t want that. 

I hate ADHD. 

In some ways it can be a gift, because if work gives me a problem then I can think of several different solutions in several settings and they really like that about me.

I bet you guys have seen a post or two like this one before, but I needed to get some feedback on this. I have been thinking about it a lot lately, and I honestly just don't know what to do or how to feel... It's not a complicated issue, I simply just used to completely borderline abuse my sister when we were both kids. I am three years older than her, and I always end up thinking that I should have PROTECTED HER, not made her feel worthless. I am the big brother, the one the younger siblings are supposed to look up to... But I utterly failed at it. And the most fucked up thing is that she STILL looks up to me in ways, to this very day, and I don't feel as if I deserve it. I feel like I don't deserve her love.

When my friends would come over, (I always had more friends than her, no real reason why other than I make friends easily) ALL she wanted was to tag along with us and have fun... But EVERY time, I would tell her to go away, and I wouldn't ever play with her. She would cry and go tell our mother, but it didn't really matter, if we didn't want her around our Mom would tell her to just stay inside. I can't even imagine what that must have been like for an 8-9-10 year old kid... Because I never had to deal with it. I always had people to play with and to have fun with and she hardly had anyone... It just makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it now. I want to cry but I can't. I feel as if any issues that she has now are DIRECTLY correlated with the way her older brother used to treat her as a kid...

I wish there were some way to make it up to her, but I know there isn't. The damage has been done, and there is no going back on stuff in the past. I can't even come up with an excuse for my behavior either... I mean, except for the fact that my brain was still developing and all that, but I knew what I was doing was wrong and I should have just let her tag along. I don't know... This was hard to write. I just don't know how to process these feelings. I have thought about them before but immediately just tried to push them away and not think about the issue. I will regret it all for the rest of my life.",True,False,[],False,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,463021,public,self,I used to treat my younger sister like shit,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/ej2303/i_used_to_treat_my_younger_sister_like_shit/,no_ads,0.0

But at the same time, I see a lot of hatred toward people who identify as transgender or non-binary, and as someone who struggles with gender dysphoria and has thought about identifying as non-binary, the way that I see people talk about people like me is honestly frightening sometimes. 

I understand that there’s a lot of toxicity in the LGBT community, and that it is prevalent in the trans and NB communities, I won’t deny that it’s there. For the most part, I don’t even really associate myself with the community that much, despite being completely pro-LGBT. And I try my best to seek out other opinions and take them into consideration because I don’t like being stuck in my own bubble/echo chamber, refusing to acknowledge any other opinion besides my own. But some of the things I see directed at NB folk honestly make me want to just retreat back to the leftist/liberal communities where I feel accepted and safe, and never step out of them again.

I see people saying that transgender people and NB people are mentally ill, and they aren’t going to “conform to our delusions” or whatever. And they use the phrase “mentally ill” as if mentally ill people are lesser people BECAUSE they are mentally ill. Yes, I do realize that we have mental illness. And I understand that not everybody agrees with us and not everybody is going to use our pronouns. But at the same time, I found it kind of ironic; if someone has depression, you wouldn’t tell them to kill themselves. If someone has anorexia, you wouldn’t call them fat and insult their body image. If someone has PTSD, you wouldn’t go outside and start popping off fireworks. But as soon as it comes to our problems, people call us delusional and stupid and refuse to accommodate for us like they would for other illnesses.

I have no sympathy for parents who pull this crap. If you wanted a specific gender that badly you should have adopted or done IVF. “Oh we could afford it-“ okay but you can afford to have an extra child you supposedly “didn’t want”? Fuck off 

I’m sure it happens with boys as well, but I know too many parents that constantly complain about their daughters, tell them they wanted boys, tell their daughters the reason they do masculine stuff with them is only because they wanted a boy, tell them how they couldn’t get the son they always wanted, etc. 

They don’t give a flying fuck about how their daughter might feel about hearing that. All they care about is how they feel. If their daughter is upset about it, oh well it’s her fault for not being a boy. I consider myself lucky my parents never said that to me,

One of my best friends is a guy (I’ve known him for about 1.5 years). I’ll call him A. He had a girlfriend of 1.5 or 2 years. Let’s call her C.  A is literally one of the sweetest people ever. C is not. When they were dating, I know she would text him CONSTANTLY saying stuff like “reply to me right now or I’m breaking up with you” and “you obviously don’t care about me if you don’t do what I’m telling you to do”. (I did not know about this until very recently. Prior to that, I had no clue, and bore no ill will towards her)

A and I share several interests: a sport, our favorite books/genres, tv shows, etc. (makes sense that we’d be friends, huh?).  She constantly disparaged our interests in a “joking” way. 

2 months ago, A breaks up with C for the 2nd time (pretty sure she was emotionally abusive, and I know she was pretty manipulative to get him to get back together with her) and they stop talking. 

Now prior to this, A, C, our friend H, and I would all eat lunch together. But they’re not talking now, so H and I decide that I’ll eat with A (because we have no classes together) and he’ll eat with C (because H doesn’t want to leave C alone/doesn’t want her to have to deal with this breakup alone). 

(Note that out of everyone, I’ve known H the longest)

H and I are talking, and I ask how C is dealing with the breakup. H says she’s still very upset. Then, H says that C really dislikes me (not sure if he said hate) and that she thinks that I like A. H actually laughed as H said this because “you and A definitely don’t like each other, and she’s just not thinking clearly bc she’s upset.”  Additionally, she thinks I like A because I don’t eat lunch with C and H anymore, so obviously I was only eating with them to be around A. That’s not why. It’s because C and I have nothing in common, she constantly disparaged interests I shared with A, and I have classes with H, so I see them often. (H also said that whenever she says crap like this, they make sure to try and reason with her/tell her I don’t like A). 

H then tells me that she’s been passive aggressive towards me for the last 2 months, and says “did you really not notice?”  The funny thing is, I didn’t. And the second H told me, I didn’t even feel angry at her. I just feel bad for her. In the last month or so, all of Cs friends, and I mean ALL of them, have gotten into arguments with her, and she’s cut them out of her life/vice versa.  

To make a long story short, I’m posting this because I DON’T feel mad, and I feel like I should. I feel like I should be pissed off that she’s been passive aggressive to me for a month, but I just find it sad that she’s dedicated a good portion of her time to disliking me, the efforts of which I have not noticed.  

Thanks for tuning in folks, I’m gonna put this out of my mind now.

My mom doesn't trust doctors or any medical stuff (except she's not anti vaxx which she likes to make very clear, that's like the only thing she's on board with. besides that her googling skills are equivalent to a medical degree). When I told her I thought therapy could help me she (and my dad) told me that therapists only try to make you worse so you keep having to see them, that's how they make money.

I just moved out to college and since my school offers counseling and basic medical services for free I took this opportunity to finally seek help for my mental health. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and my doctor has been trying to find treatments to help.

When I first started describing my problems to the doctor she was shocked that I'd never gotten help before. I don't want to go into the specifics, but she was amazed that I still considered my mom and I to have a pretty good relationship despite our disagreements.

I told my mom along the way everything that has been happening and I thought her opinion was shifting. She hadn't said anything negative about me seeking help and she offered to pay for medication. It was all going pretty well and I was finally feeling like I could be open with her.

Also while my family and I was staying at my grandparents' house around Thanksgiving I talked to my grandma (who is a retired social worker who also personally deals with mental health problems that she gets treated for) and my mom together about me possibly seeing a psychiatrist because my doctor recommended it due to thinking my problems were beyond the scope of her training. My grandma said she would've always advised one of her clients see a psychiatrist over a general practitioner because they have a lot more experience and said she was skeptical of the medication I was on and how effective it would be for my particular issues and assured me it didn't mean I was crazy. That was really nice to hear from her and made me feel a lot better about it.

Then just yesterday i was on the phone with my mom and the conversation of seeing a psychiatrist and my problems with medication came up again and she started saying things like ""well you've always been looking for something to be wrong with you"" and ""back in my day we didn't have to have labels or medication for these things, that's just the way you were""

I kept my calm during the conversation but it made me really mad that she seems to think I've been making up problems for attention all these years and finally told me to my face. Literally there's so much mental illness in my family history, it's not insane that i could've inherited it. I honestly think it's because she has a lot of the same problems I have but just thinks that's normal.

But like around age 12-13 she knew I was very depressed for a while but I remember she asked ""are you excited for christmas"" and when I said yes she was basically like ""okay well that means you don't have depression"". It's just been so weirdly dismissive.

I really don't want family drama, but this is just getting so ridiculous. I'm just trying to improve my mental health finally.

Reddit's gonna hate me for this one, but I promise I can justify it.  Maybe someone can change my perception?   I always hear the same ""don't have time"" or ""don't have the energy"" or ""I'll start in January, new year new me!"".  It's all bullshit.  Everyone is addicted to being lazy and some are so fucking good at it they'd rather work in 7-11 or a factory than train themselves to build new skills.  How do I know this?  Here's the backstory:

My parents had 3 kids by the time they were in their mid-20s, 4 kids by 30. The first time my parents made more than a combined $45,000 was just a couple years ago.  My dad has been a long time GM employee and my mom has either stayed at home to care for kids or worked for UPS.  

Growing up I often went hungry as we ran out of food stamp money pretty quickly, had to wear clothes that strangers gave us, and the longest I lived in a single home was 3 years.  When people ask where I laugh and say ""well I'm a bit of a mutt""... it hurts, but it's true, I don't have a home..

I always thought my parents were a victim of circumstances, but let's cut the crap, they're not.   They're victims of their own behavior.  They spend money at any chance they get, even when they don't have any.  They grow bored of the smallest project, even hanging a picture frame could have an endless timeline.  The garage is FILLED with unfinished shit.

Their excuses always feel so genuine ""we work hard, we try our best, but we always fall short.  We had kids way too young and we'd rather focus on your happiness""

Except they fucking didn't, I was constantly cleaning bathrooms, sweeping floors, washing walls, hand cleaning curtains, etc etc etc.  

At the age of 12 I paid my first electric bill with my birthday money.  

My parents are intelligent enough to have good jobs, but they don't.  My parents are strong enough to have good jobs, but they don't.  My parents are white, and as ugly as that sounds, there's no excuse there either.

Fine, I admit it, my parents suck.. but that doesn't mean other people do too.. right?  Well................  I haven't met someone that is poor that has done a damn thing about it other than bitch.

When I lived in Miami and Chicago, I had tons of poor friends because I was poor.  Their behaviors were the same, here's how the cycle works:

- sad ""because poor""

- complain about job and being out of shape

- have mental breakdown and lean on friends / family

- finally get the energy to make an effort only to smoke pot, get wasted, or stuff their face with fast food.

- start over

My first year out of school I made $11,400.  That was 2014.  This year I'll make ~$250,000.  How?  I fucking ground myself to the bones working on things I hated because I was desperate to get out of poverty!!

When I started working like this my friends were NOT supportive. 
 I wasn't around as often and I couldn't party on week nights.  They thought it was a waste of time, they thought I'd spend my life chasing money, they thought I'd never be happy.  Truthfully, I have always been riddled with depression and anxiety, but you know what?  I'M HAPPY NOW!!!!

I work less than I used to, I get to sleep in, and in general I can do anything I want.  Hawaii?  Sure.  Oktoberfest in Munich?  Hell yeah.  Anything I want, it's mine to have now.  

You know what it cost me?  5 years of mind-numbing, dogshit work.  But look where I am now, only 27 years old and on top of the world.  If I don't want to work in this business in the future, I won't have to because I will have saved enough to do whatever I want.  I don't hear from my old friends anymore, I reach out now and then, but they're usually too busy working the late shift on a Saturday.  It's okay though, I've made new friends with similar work habits to my own.

**TL'DR -**  The poor people in my life all have the same, self-destructive behavior and refuse to do anything about it.

My sister’s best friend recently turned 18. We have been flirty (mostly her) in the past but since I’m a shy 23 year old guy I never really thought her like that. She’s confident and aggressive. Due to our age difference and difference in personality I never thought of her that way but it’s clear she has hinted at being interested in me. So three days ago she sleeps over at our house. My parents our out of town and she and my sister were camping out in the television room for the night and I went to bed. Then next thing I know is I’m naked and she’s on top of me. I vaguely remember taking of my clothes but I was really quite sleepy. Then she started riding me. At this point I realize what is going on, that I’m wearing 0 protection, and that I’m not losing my virginity the way I wanted to. I tried to say something but it came out as more of a moan and so she put her hand over my mouth and told me to moan quietly. I must admit I liked that she did that but at this point I was so scared at what was happening I just kind of froze and let it happen. I didn’t last much longer and came inside her. She then left to take a shower and I started crying. That wasn’t how I wanted to lose my virginity and I was upset I didn’t say anything and I was upset because it felt so good. I was also worried my life was over because she might be pregnant now. She came back to my room after and told she’s on birth control and that I don’t have to worry. Then she got in bed with me again and started touching me. She was saying how horny I made her and I must admit it turned me on but I really wasn’t in the mood to be touched. I suggested that maybe we just cuddle the rest of the night but she insisted that she would make me feel good. So I let her give me oral and a hand job and then went down on her. After that we cuddled and right before I fell asleep she fondled my penis and said she likes holding it. I must add also that she liked squeezing my butt and my nipples. It honestly really just felt like she “owned” my body in a way. When I woke up the next morning she was not in my bed. I felt completely dejected and mortified. I feel like I should have done more but her confidence and aggressiveness was kind of intimidating and I was also feeling pleasure so I was making myself confused. I hoped it was a dream but she snapped me a pic of her vagina later the next day saying how she wants me to eat her out again. So far she’s sent me a nude everyday.
