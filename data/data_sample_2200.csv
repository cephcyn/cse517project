I'm always nervous I'll say the wrong thing that will tell them not to hire me. I'm a nervous person, who relies on crossing my arms and legs to relax. I've been told that's a turn off for most employers when conducting interviews. I need to get a job before the fall so I can move forward in my career. It also doesn't help I have the pressure of my parents asking me each day how my job hunt is going. I'm not trying to avoid getting a job, I just wish I wasn't the way I am and could just GET a job with no issues."
3162,dd8yzf,tyewcic,"I’m terrified of graduating college, help.","Hi reddit,


So I am a super senior public health major at a state school doing everything I can in my own power to not graduate college. 


I went abroad spring 2018 to Australia and after that, I have been terrified of graduating. And the biggest problem is that I keep getting in my own way.  


I always skip class. I always do assignments late now and even don’t do some. I’m always getting in my own way because I’m just so scared of graduating.


I have been given so many chances to finish and I’m still doing the same things.


And to make matters worse, my parents have paid for school throughout and I have no debt, so I feel like an even bigger asshole.


This is my third time taking an integral course to my graduation, and it isn’t a difficult class. It is a seminar on graduating. And I can never bring myself to go. I can’t bring myself to do the assignments. I don’t know why I’m like this and why I keep getting in my own way.  I got an email from a professor telling me, yet again, that she is concerned for my performance in this course. 


And I just don’t know what to do, and don’t know if anyone in this subreddit could help me with this issue and if they’ve ever gotten in their own way to do things.


What are some steps I can take in the right direction to do what is right? I feel like my head is just all over the place lately and I have no idea what to do 


Thank you"
3208,dcywq8,inrealphife,How to address relocation with your employer,"Kia Ora reddit whanau,

I am looking to relocate to Australia from New Zealand in September 2020 but ideally I would relocate to the Sydney office of our company.

I do intend to move back to England for around four months between my move from NZ to AU but I wonder what the best way to handle this with my employer would be?

I’d plan to leave the company in/around June so do you think it would be too early to raise this with my employer? I also feel compelled to check with HR that this is indeed possible. 

Any advice is very appreciated.

33137,84005y,unmotivatedtrashacc,"I have no motivation for life, even after being homeless","To give a little background, growing up I was a total lazy ass. I would never invest the time I needed to in my school work, which is stupid as hell because I have the intellect to get straight a's without much dificulty. I did just enough and only just enough to scrape by. In high school i thought I had something together. I went to tech school part time while in high school for automotive and thought thats what my career was gonna be, but I was wrong. I hated working in a shop, and couldn't even manage to keep a job wherever I went, normally due to poor work ethic. So I decided to try to go back to school. I tried to do community college classes and I picked up a part time retail job. I eventually dropped out of college, same piss poor motivation kept me from doing enough work. I kept this retail job and started working more hours. That retail job was the only job in my life I kept for more than a couple months. I worked it for 2 years without issue, but truthfully its only because its literally the easiest job that gives a paycheck stub. In an 8 hour shift I only had about 2 hours of actual work to do, rest of the time I could watch anime in the back and only have to worry about customers. My lack of motivation kept me from getting a better job, and eventually my parents righfully dropped the hammer on me. I got the boot out of the house, and as a homeless person I didn't do much of anything. I would bum off people, use the available aid for me, and try whatever to get high on something. I found a place to sleep, it sucked but it wasn't bad enough for me to do anything about it. Anyways a couple weeks ago my parents searched and found me and brough me back home, they stated that they hoped making me homeless would motivate me to get off my dead ass but they were wrong. They didn't have the guts to leave their only son homeless.

I don't get the point in life. In my world life is 95% grind, 5% pleasure, and that 5% just doesn't seem worth the 95%. I feel like I wasn't meant for this world. I don't have the ability to take care of myself,  and mommy and daddy wont hold my hand forever. I'm 22 years old and I'm lifetime loser and the future looks even darker. I thought high school was a miserable experience, but looking back on it seems I peaked in high school. Life just feels miserable all the time, my laziness and lack of motivation will keep me from holding a real job. Those little bits in life that are enjoyable just aren't enough for me. Truthfull I've considered suicide as an option. I just feel like a product of natural selection. I'm just one of those people that just doesn't have the genetic make up be a successful person. I'm just a burden to people around me cause I can't take care of myself. The only thing stopping me is the fact that people will feel guilty and blame themselves if I do it.

It feels like my only purpose in life is to be miserable. I can't do the grind, it's so miserable to me. All I'm good for is staying alive so people don't regret me dying, that's it. I've tried to force myself to motivate, but I just can't. I can do it for 2 weeks max before I will revert back to my old lazy ways.

So what should I do? What can deadweight do?"

Saw each other multiple times throughout the week. After the first week, I pretty much got the idea that she has a hard time trusting guys because of past relationships so I made sure she knew that was a serious guy and not here to just mess around with her. Things went great for about another 2 weeks but all of sudden about 1 1/2 weeks ago she’s starts being dry through text conversations, barely calls and whenever we set up a date, she ends up giving a busy excuse the day of our date. So the questions I have about this is 

1) Am I in one of those situations where I have to pull back for a while because I’m chasing her to hard and let her come to me or is this something else?

2) Since it feels like she’s pulling away, is this the end of things?

Any advice whether it’s from your own personal experience or just advice you heard from other people would be greatly appreciate. Thank you."

Ever since, I have always liked her, but because after our little no-contact period after we had broken up, I chose to throw my emotions on the back of my mind and forget them because I believed that they weren't appropriate anymore. At the time it seemed like a good idea and it worked, but after four years of being around each other one way or the other due to school, in the end, my plan didn't work out worth of garbage. Four years later, I still like her and now I hate the fact that I do since I believe that this shouldn't be something to exist anymore. I don't know how she feels about me but I can say that she's moved on and due to that, I don't know what the hell to do with myself, especially since we barely talk to each other anymore (probably since I pushed her away in attempt to forget my feelings for her years earlier). Soon we'll both graduate and we'll disappear from each other's lives, and my plan is to simply let time pass and not let myself ponder anything no matter what, but at this point I'm so mentally exhausted that my very feelings are starting to annoy me. What can I do to get rid of them? I don't need them dragging me down later on and I don't know what to do with them now because the idea of telling how I feel feels inappropriate and unreasonable, especially since its been four years since our breakup.

They approve of him and always say he’s a good guy and is mature, which I agree with as well. However, whenever he comes over to me and my parent’s home, we are not permitted to go upstairs to my bedroom. Of course I understand why. They probably don’t want us to be having sex and all that. Who would want to be in the house while their daughter is being screwed? So obviously I get that. But the thing I don’t understand is.. I had an ex bf who I let meet my parents as well. They were fond with him and welcomed him to our home. It only took my ex bf 2 months in the relationship with me and him for my parents to let him go upstairs in my room. They knew we had sex. They knew we would sleep together in the room. So I don’t understand why they’re making it so difficult with this one. I come from a Chinese household, whereas my current bf is Arab. Maybe it’s a racist thing? Idk. Cuz my ex was Filipino and they seemed way easier on him than they are on my Arab bf. The sad part is my ex cheated in the worse possible way. So their excuse is they’re trying to prevent me from getting hurt again. But this guy is different. My parents make us sit in the living room where so many of my family members walk past, so what privacy do we even have?"
28786,8kpucf,warmbun,I feel guilty for something I didn’t do. In high school a girl accused me of saying the n word and being racist,"So here’s the story: 

Back in fifth grade being asian and growing up in a white area, I did not know what the n word was. This white girl who ended up bullying me kept telling me to say it or she would beat me up. She beat me up anyways and wrote the word on the wall saying it was me. I was harassed for years by this one guy and in high school a teacher believed it and she was really mean to me. Later on in high school the teacher died and the counselors had to talk to me about her. In the end, no one believed me and it caused a lot of problems with me socially and I’m scared of interacting with people. I never meant to hurt anyone and I never wanted to be racist. Not everyone in my school knew about and I’m not exactly sure what the rumors were, but the people that did know about it physically hurt me and told me to kill myself. 

I know I didn’t do anything wrong, but sometimes I feel so guilty I cry. I know it’s been years and I shouldn’t worry about it, but I want to stop feeling guilty about something I didn’t do. "

Granted, my girlfriend and I have argued and had disagreements but it’s nothing out of the norm of being in a relationship. I stated my discomfort with him and she finally blocked him on everything.

Supposedly he’s been reaching out to everyone my gf talks to in order to convince her to let him apologize but both of us think it’s pointless and she has no desire to hear him out. Today, her friend described how he bought trash bags and was laughing oddly out loud, saying he was getting them for trash, but then did a gun gesture to his head and talked about how “he had messed up”. Ever since hearing about the killing me thing, I’ve been on edge enough that I bought a pocketknife in case something happens.

Will this fix things? No.
Am I selfish? Yes.

I am a worthless piece of garbage who just svrews everything up. Its my fault that she is probably now crying. It's my fault that I am now crying. Everyone is mad at her and I but it should only be me. 

Maybe if I do this it'll distract everyone for a week or two. Give time to help her stop beating down on her. Maybe it'll help them see how worthless I was anyways.

All I know is if I don't do it now it'll be too late. We don't want a repeat of last time. We mustnt fail again or everything will be even worse.

How am I going to do it? Not sure. Maybe I'll just lay in the highway. 

Maybe jump off a ledge. Not sure...

I just want to stop existing because I know it hurts everyone else. Only a few people would miss me but I hope they'd move on.

That's my one fear. What if she doesnt. What if she follows suit. I know Id never know but it's immoral to put her through that.

But I've already screwed up this much... I dont even know why she loves me... Im literal garbage...

The only other person isnt a person but my dogs... Would dogs get over a death if they didnt know? I mean my parents would still take care of them but would doing this hurt them?

My jobs would also be upset. But mostly due to lack of a worker. Granted One is a dying job position and the other could easily hire someone new.  

But funerals cost alot of money... Hopefully they'll just throw me in the trash where I belong.

Sell all my stuff.

Make a profit...

664,dqkyup,yawaworth1994,How do I build a social life?,"Some brief context: I am a 25 year old male. Growing up I had abusive parents, little to no family, and was constantly moved about. During my teenage years, I was swallowed up by depression and severe social anxiety, which resulted in mental health issues the likes of which I consider myself lucky to be alive after. The ages of 15-19 were so dark I am surprised I didn't kill myself. I dropped out of sixth form/high school and did not attend college/university. I spent years 19 - 25 rebuilding my life. I learned to code and became a software engineer. I entertained a girlfriend for a couple of years. I have spent the last 2 years at a company with a hyper social culture where extroverts succeed, immersing myself in their way of life and essentially trying to put myself through a crash course on social skills. I still struggled a lot with little to no social life and bad drug/video game habits. Recently after finally coming into work and not feeling panic and I have been able to turn my habits around and kick video games/drugs/other forms of escapism altogether.

Despite tremendous progress, I am still faced with the same problem that has plagued me all my life. I have no social life and find it difficult to form and retain friends. The people I like never seem to like me back. I am familiar with the normal advice on making friends - go to things with people that have with similar interests and form connections that way. I've found this to be a horribly ineffective way of making friends, my main interest up until this point has been turning myself from a troglodyte in a reasonably well functioning member of society and that's just not something a lot of people seem to want to bond over.

Any advice is hugely appreciated!"

21895,9j4hdm,hypse,How do I tell someone they are not welcome (in my friend group)?,"This sounds very mean but let me explain.

Also heads up, I do mention a particular sexual activity.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends and I are first-year college students so our friend group does fluctuate and is somewhat messy. Anyways, there is this guy who was introduced to us by an ex-friend (ex because he was an asshole and overall a horrible friend); let's name this guy Ryan and the ex-friend Jeff.

First and foremost, this guy Ryan is a dick. He recorded one of my friends (let's name her Amy) giving him head without her permission and sent it off to his friends. He apologized after Amy found out and supposedly deleted the video-- supposedly because we never saw him do it, he only said he did so. After that she stopped talking to him and most of us cut him off entirely.

Then, Ryan and Jeff got super plastered and damaged $300 worth of valuables of Amy's roommates stuff. They had to call an ambulance after they blacked out and one of them seized-- and ultimately damaged Amy's rep in our scholarship program. Mind you, they never paid them back for any of the damages.

Now, Jeff got the hint that a few of us weren't too fond of him and kept his distance from us.. but Ryan on the other hand just turned really creepy. He kept trying to talk to Amy for a week, even though she told him to just stop talking to her altogether. Then, my friends and I went to this party-- didn't tell him or anything. When we got there, he somehow found us and began following us around. When I separated from Amy, he came up to me and asked very aggressively where she was. Even if I knew I wouldn't have told him but he kept asking and I told him she was outside (which it was likely she wasn't). 

I realize this is getting very long so I will try to shorten the rest. 

Still at the party-- He just stood there and watched us (like five people; two couples, me and Amy) and even recorded us. He did not dance at all, just watched. Then he followed Amy and I outside, so we went back in-- he followed, went back out-- still followed. It went on like this for ten minutes until a group of people separated him from us. 

FF; Some of us will go to the dining hall for lunch or dinner and bam, he's there 5 mins later (I blame snap maps). He will walk around for a bit before deciding to sit with us and make things very awkward by just staring at us. We all see him before he sits down and someone will say they're going to say something if he sits down-- but none of them do!

I'm wondering what's the best way to go about this. He makes ALL the girls uncomfortable. I only put in the staple incidents where he really irked us but.. this guy is so creepy and possibly unintentionally so but he really angers me! Especially after what he did!

I'm starting to have doubts about our relationship and I honestly wish we did not go together, because she wants to see me a lot and its starting to get too much. I will literally be seeing her in every lecture, lab practical and advisor meeting and I honestly need some space.  

I did Biology, Chemistry and Maths and got BCB respectively. I know these aren't awful grades, but I was predicted AAA and was originally going to go to a uni much further away, this was my backup option. Part of me wants to reapply next year somewhere else. My high school has given me the chance to resit, lots of other people are doing so. I didn't do it sooner as I felt like I should give things a go and didn't want to be left behind. However I really want to go away now.

I haven't paid anything yet and have a bout a week to decide. I know this could all be temporary and two weeks isn't a long time, but honestly I'm not homesick or not enjoying myself. I've made friends and honestly think Uni is for me, but I want to do another course at a place further away. Any advice?"

24908,95muyk,Scaredsisterless,I think I’m getting scammed by my sister (again) - what do you think?,"My relationship with my sister has never been easy. We just started talking via text and phone calls after not speaking for a decade. The reason we didn’t talk for so long was because while at my wedding, she stole all the cash from the wedding cards (over $2k) and blew it all on heroin. 

We were raised in serious dysfunction, but where I went one way to escape the cycle, she repeated it. In the last ten years she’s been in and out of rehab and she’s now (she says) 3 years clean. She’s moved away from our mom, the one that enabled all this shit with my sister, and has a job and an apartment and seems steady. 

So, I’ve started speaking to her again. She reached out on social media to apologize and ask about paying me back the money she took. One thing lead to another and I let her back into my life - with huge safeguards in place, for obvious reasons. She knows the state I live in, but not the town. She knows my phone number and my married surname. She doesn’t know my house address and as far as I know, I’ve done a decent job of keeping my info as private as possible on the interwebs because I’m scared of having my identity stolen or something happening by other members of my family. 

Anyway, this morning I got a phone call from a pay day loan scam place looking for my sister. I immediately freaked out. How did this place get my number and why are they calling me looking for my sister? I haven’t talked to her in 10 years until just a couple months ago. I don’t want her to try to steal my identity or something. I’ve worked so hard to get to where I am in life and I honestly have a lot to lose if she got ahold of my personal information. Nothing about this feels right, but I’m also dealing with the filling of the void inside by having this relationship with her restored. Should I cut her out again, or take extra steps to protect myself in keeping this door open? "
17976,b9yalj,danielgoncalves7,Borrowing a digital camera to my uni colleagues doesn't seem like a good idea,"Ok, so here's the thing. I'm 23, studying in an uni.

There will be a meeting with teachers and such this Tuesday, and people who were elected by our colleagues are in charge of the organization. I am included in these people, and was put in a team that is meant to organize food and beverages. All is cool so far.

However today I was talking with everyone else in our Facebook group chat and I ended up asking what they were planing to do regarding photography, and that I had a semi-pro camera. Out of a sudden, a girl, who was on my team around the food, volunteers to take the pictures, and everyone else agrees without ever actually asking for my consent and how comfortable I kinda was with it... They said since I had something to do, it was better to give away that function to someone else, even though that ""someone else"" also had something to do... I just went with the flow and complied.

I mean, I don't really mind that much. Organizing the food part is pretty easy, and after that I can just stay outside reading a book or working or studying, whereas taking pictures would actually take some work and effort, and I really don't find myself having fun taking them. That said, I really don't trust the girl or any of these people and I feel kinda stepped on. Then there's the added obvious fear that if something happens to the camera, nobody will take responsibility. 

Ideas? I'm feeling a bit resented but I'm not sure if it's that legit or if it's just a petty feeling I should overcome. What do you guys think? Should I say something, at least express what I'm thinking? "
36550,7smlw8,Nazzyboy,I might be about to dump my girlfriend (21F),"Need some advice here guys, me and my girlfriend have been going strong for three years, today is our three year anniversary, and I’m afraid I’m about to break things up with her.

She’s been texting her Ex boyfriend, (they were only together for about 1 month) for a week now and the messages have been non stop between each other. I accidentally caught a glimpse of her messages to him through the lens of her glasses and they were incredibly long. I’ve asked if she still has feelings for him and she’s hesitant and won’t say anything.

She’s done this three times before with three separate people all of those times she’s stopped talking to them. This time she’s not budging and I’m afraid. She says she still loves me and doesn’t want to leave me but she also won’t stop talking to him. I’ve given her an ultimatum him, or me but she can’t decide and said to sleep on it.

The three times she’s previously done this I’ve given her chance after chance. I’ve never done anything like this to her, she’s also asked me to stop seeing and speaking to multiple people, because she didn’t like it, which I have done without hesitation. It’s so hard to leave her, I know I have to but I can’t let myself do it.

She’s coming round my house today in an hour, I’ve said we’re splitting up over text but she should come round today to talk about things. I’m not sure what questions to ask. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
26432,8xjj79,Trsddppy,"i have 2 ideas on how i want to help people, but im not sure where the need is greater? (social workers will have the best advice)","I’m a fairly regular guy in my 20s looking for a way to improve the world. I don’t really spend much money on myself, and I have 2 ideas on how I want to spend my extra money, both helping people a social worker might see often.

1. I want to adopt kids who are too old to typically find a good foster family. A friend I had in high school got thrown into the system at 16 and couldn’t find a home that wasn’t abusive until her social worker actually adopted her. I want to help people get out of that system and into the world.
2. I want to help young adults who are trapped by their parents. People in the 18-23 range who have been abused consistently their entire lives and are desperate to get out but don’t have the financial independence to do so. I hadn’t considered this until recently when someone on a dating app told me she’s trying to marry herself off to whoever to get away from her father. I’ll be moving out of my parents house later this year and I told her she can stay with me at LEAST until she’s financially independent. (Don’t worry, no creepy sex favors). The way I want to expand on this is to buy apartments and “rent” them out to people in similar situations for basically nothing, first month totally free probably.

TLDR: So my real question, where is the need/impact greater? A home for older kids/teens or help with financial independence for young adults? And practically speaking, how challenging would it be to “advertise” to people who want to escape abuse?

In case you are wondering why I want to do this, I’m a socialist born into an upper middle class family."

18203,b8hys1,wawatertermemelonlon,How do I cope with my dog's death?,"I just need help and I guess get it all off my chest, sorry for the long post. Advice I tried to find on the internet only made it worse for me.

She was only 2.5 yo and had a weak heart. Caught kennel cough about one week ago and changed from a hyperactive jrt to a heavy breathing poor baby in two days. The meds didn't help at all, she was doing 2 breaths a second, and finally her heart gave up yesterday while she was in my arms.

[Tmi alert]
First she pooped on me, then there was so much foam coming from her mouth and nose. I cannot get this image out of my mind. 
[End of tmi]

I performed cpr and took her to the vet immediately (I was going to go there in half an hour anyway and I'm so angry at myself I didn't go there sooner, although the vet said it wouldn't change anything, that because of her heart condition the cough is lethal).

I have never loved anyone more than her, I don't think I ever developed such strong feelings to any human. I remember laying in bed with her every night (back when she was fine) and almost crying because I loved her so much and was so overwhelmed with emotions towards her.

Another thing is that about a month ago I decided to move out from my parents' and with my bf we found an awesome flat just by a lake. I decided on it mostly because I imagined going for walks with my dog every morning, it seemed so perfect. Last summer I took her to this lake a couple of times and she loved it, but it's quite far from my parents' house and I don't have a car so it was quite a trip. I couldn't wait for warmer days to come to spend hours outside with her. And she died on the first warm day this year. I try to tell myself that at least she was able to play in the sand a bit, watch the ducks, run around in the grass... Now all my new pretty flat does is remind me that I don't need it and that there's no point living here since she's dead.

I try to make myself think it's for the better - I got behind with my school work and I gave up my job just because I felt guilty when she was home alone (my family isn't home most of the time). Now maybe I can focus on my life instead of focusing on her only. Maybe it was a bit unhealthy of me to behave this way, but I felt so guilty always when I had to leave her alone.

Also I'm afraid it's my fault that she caught the cough - here by the lake we've met a couple dogs that weren't homeless but looked uncared for, it's very likely she caught it from one of them. She's met hundreds of dogs in her life, I had no idea this disease existed before she got it, I didn't know but again I feel so guilty.

I try to tell myself that she was happy, I gave her the best life I could, and I know it's just the second day and it will probably get better but I feel so hopeless right now and I don't know how to cope. I've never lost any pet before, I never even lost a relative or a friend so it's all so new to me and I experience it on the creature I probably loved the most ever in my life.

Yesterday I took 1mg of alprazolam when usually 0.25 is more than enough for me and it did nothing. I try to distance myself from life by playing stupid games on my phone but she still comes to my mind all the time. My family wants to spend time with me because they're also heartbroken, it was also their dog, but my sister is crying all the time and my mum keeps talking about all the memories she has and all of it makes me feel even worse. And I feel guilty again for leaving them to cope with it alone. I used to come home very often because the dog loves them and I wanted her to be able to spend time with them too, now I just can't come there.

I know it will pass but what can I do now? Normally every time I felt bad the only thing that kept me going was her and now I lost all purpose in life. She literally helped me overcome any suicidal thoughts because I knew I couldn't leave her. I haven't eaten anything for two days and all I want to do is sleep because it's the only way I can run away.

Some people say it's best to get a new dog asap and maybe that's what I should do but I don't think I'm in the right condition to take care of anyone right now.

I just miss her so much "
7768,cosdug,xemotrashpanda,My friend is asking me for nudes.,"One of my friends (male) is asking me for nudes as a sign of trust. He says that we're close enough now and he wants me to send them so that he can ""enjoy and critique"" them. I feel like if I send him he might use them against me later. Also I'm not really comfortable showing him my body because I know he's an absolute porn freak but I'm scared if I say no I might lose him.

What should I say to him? It kind of pisses me off with how sexual he is towards me and I don't like it. I'm afraid of him having strong sexual feelings towards me which I feel like will happen if I do send them. Also he has some really weird fetishes like one time he wanted me to pee on him to which I said no. That made him feel a little down but I fear if I refuse again this time, he'll end our friendship for good. What should I do?"
30900,8bwf2h,thesmellnextdoor,"Should I quit the job that I like for a job with much better career potential, but that I may not like as much?","I have a job that I like. It's super-easy, I am left alone, there is zero stress and I can pretty much spend the whole day reading, most days. On the flip side, there is no advancement opportunity, it's only part-time and I make just barely over minimum wage. I've been there for about a year.

This week I started a second part-time job which is basically my ""dream job."" It's in the legal field which I went to school for and what I want to do as a career. I've only worked there 3 days so far, but my boss seems nice and says I'm doing good. If I can last at this job it would become a career. I make more money there and would be able to bring my dog to work if I worked full-time.

Today my new boss asked me if I would put in my notice at my other job because she wants me to work for her full-time. This is good news! But I am worried about the stress of this new job. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up and could wind up getting fired or burnt out. If I leave the other job, I will not be able to get it back. There's only one slot to fill, so once they replace me, I can't return there. The other job is a dead end, but it's been nice there. I am comfortable there. The new job is full of opportunity but is also stressful and can be overwhelming. What if I fall apart and can't handle it?

I know what I should do, but what would you do and why?"

21833,9jf3xn,roooooob,"My car salesman told me he'd pay my $1,000 bill and now he's saying he won't. How do I handle this?","I got an e-mail from my salesman (let's call him Joe) back in May.  Joe had sold me a car lease a few years and he was checking in to see how everything was going and if I would be interested in leaving my lease early to enter into a new one.  I agreed I'd come down to talk to him but I was happy with my current car and even thinking about purchasing after the lease had ended (*I know that's a bad idea but it's had to find a cheap stick shift car these days.)*

&amp;#x200B;

I meet with Joe, he shows me a few cars, and we agree on a reasonable price for the new car.  He inspects my old car, and turns it over to his service division to do an inspection as well while we fill out all the paperwork for the new car.  Before I sign anything, I ask very clearly if I will owe anything for the old car.  No hidden fees, final payments, or anything.  I made sure to say ""I will owe no more money for the old car"" and he agrees.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks later, I get a bill in the mail for \~$1,000 for excess wear and tear on my car.  I email Joe and forward him the bill with the explanation of the charges.  He tells me not to worry and that he'll take care of it.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks after that, I see that my account is still being charged.  I again email Joe and ask what's going on.  He again assures me that he's taking care of it and ""we're all good.""

&amp;#x200B;

Another few weeks go by and I start receiving phone calls and letters from a collections agency.  They inform me that my debt with the car manufacturer still stands and it's now in the hands of collections.  I email Joe again with copies of the letters and he tells me, ""he thought this was already handled.""  I ask him to get to the bottom of this before my credit gets affected.

&amp;#x200B;

The next time I hear from him, he has a very different approach to the situation.  He tells me I should pay them if I want to protect my credit.  I ask him why he hasn't paid it like he said he would and he tells me he never said he would, despite emails I have to the contrary.  I forward him the emails and he tells me he wasn't talking about my bill.  There was no other subject being talked about in the emails.  He tells me I never sent him a bill or a statement or a collections letter.  He ignores me when I send him copies of these emails with his responses.  I've contacted the consumer affairs department for the car manufacturer.  They did an investigation but told me they could not do anything aside for insisting the dealership communicate with me to find a resolution.  I've tried to contact the general manager but Joe won't put me in contact with him and I only get voicemail when I call the office.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't have made the sale with him I knew there would be back charges.  I asked him if there would be and he said no.  I don't know what to do now.  I don't think there's any legal footing here, but maybe I can apply some PR pressure?  What do you all think?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR -- My car salesman told me I would not have any charges for a car I was turning in.  I was charged later.  He told me he'd pay the charges.  He never did.  Now he's telling me to pay them myself."

Living here is extremely awkward with their different standards of..well everything from what I am used to. I'm told I'm lazy and entitled because I am not constantly bowing down to thank them or knowing when I'm expected to start scrubbing a mess I didn't notice. I can't connect with any of them over anything, and the foster dad can't understand my accent at all with his hearing loss. It is frustrating and I feel alienated. They are good people and doing a good service, but I need more social interaction than I'm getting here even if it means I'm being abused at the same time or whatever.

My only living relatives are my dad and little half bro, who I haven't seen in many years. I used to live with him as a little kid, and he used to physically abuse me and let his friends molest me. He went to jail because I snitched to police and he never forgave me. When I see him, he calls me a slur for gays and says I'm not his son. I know he's not a nice person, but I still want to get back on his good side if possible. I just don't know how to open communication with him again. Guides online say to accept blame, but he sees phrases like, ""I'm sorry,"" as bending over backwards for someone and gets angry because it is super fake. In his words, a real man is never sorry for his actions.

I don't know if he'd ever want me to live with him. I want to at least go back to a familiar place even if it's not the most welcoming."

30521,8d5a9u,runsillyrabbit,I think I’ve lost my brother to a porn star,"I feel like I’ve hit a wall, and I don’t know what to do. 
I need some help. 
This story is intense and seems like it can’t even be real.
So my brother and I have always been super close. Our parents are very childish and used to fight a lot and neglect us a little in a way that meant we only had each other. 
Long story short I felt like, in a family full of nutcases he was my only saviour. 
He honestly has a heart of gold and I’ve always felt I could count on him, we are now in our mid-late twenties and have lasted as best friends into adulthood. 
But two years ago he met this girl... 
She came into his life as someone who already had a partner and for some reason he was smitten. 
She would often come by our house and hang out with him but when I pulled her aside to see how serious she was she told me ‘I will never leave my boyfriend’ and I told her then if that’s how she felt to stop leading on my brother and let him go. 
I also offered him the advice of if she isn’t in it for you then don’t waste your time, you’ll meet someone else... so they stopped being friends for a little while. 
All good! 
THEN the bombshell came. 
This ‘innocent’ girl my brother still seems to have a major crush on, posted on Facebook that’s she is ‘going into the new year single!’ And I was like ‘shit! What happened to I’m never leaving my boyfriend?’ 

I walked in to ask my brother if he knew about this but before I even spoke he shoved his phone right up into my face and said ‘WATCH THIS VIDEO!’ 
So my boyfriend and I stare down at his phone and low and behold it’s a porno, my brother shows me fucked up videos all the time so I’m just waiting for a midget to come out or a horse or something and then I realised, it’s HER!
A little younger but a lot more naked, and there’s not just one video, there are like 20. 
She’s signed up to ‘Girls out west’. 
Apparently what had happened is, one of her boyfriends friends had found these videos and sent them to her boyfriend, (bare with me) and he confronted her about it, she went with deny, deny, deny and he dumped her for being a liar. 

Don’t get me wrong, if that’s what you want to do with your life, go for it! 
But don’t lie when your God damn face is on the TV!
So I asked my brother what he was going to do and he didn’t really give me an answer which to me means he’s already put her number on speed dial and saved her videos in his phone to ‘watch later’ 

This was around Christmas time and we were joyfully passing her video around the Christmas dinner table having a laugh at how my brother thought this ‘lovely’ girl was his soul mate and she’s just a gross liar. 
(My family are Aussies and very open so this isn’t that weird to be passing a porno around the table lol) 

A very minuscule amount of time goes by and he is already hanging out with her all the time and it starts to become a thing.  
Rebound gone wrong. 

She’s coming over our house and sucking up my Mums ass and they are all besties and I already don’t like her because she’s a liar and clearly shifty. 
But then I start to realise other things about her personality. She’s a fake, she’s highly insecure, she’s different to me when no one is watching, she’s manipulative and all in all not a nice person. 

I respect my brother likes this girl but I do give him my opinion a few times. I’m very subtle and gentle with him so he doesn’t get mad at me, but I’m also very blunt about how I’m worried he’ll get too caught up in her and it will end badly. 
He accepts my concern but does absolutely nothing about it. 

Move forward a year of their annoying bullshit, talking in baby voices and feeding each other McDonalds chips /vom. 

Then America happens.

When we were little my Dad promised to take us to Disneyland in the USA and then when they got divorced he made it out like it was all Mums fault we could never go and vice versa. 
I was old enough to know it was all bullshit but my brother was heartbroken. I still remember him asking me in his little nappy if we really weren’t going to go and see Mickey... 
I promised him that one day we would go and I would take him no matter what. 

Flash forward, our trip has finally come, we can finally afford it and we are ready to go, I’m bringing my boyfriend so only fair he brings his girlfriend even though I hate her. I’m fine with it. 
She doesn’t want to go and tries to stop him from going. 
It almost works.
I pretty much die of heartbreak because he doesn’t want to go without her when it’s OUR trip that she isn’t invited on anyway. 
Eventually he mans up enough to Insist and the trip I’ve booked for 5 weeks he agrees to go on for 2 weeks. 
Better than nothing? 
Wrong. Nothing would have been better. 

Long story short she ruined the whole trip. She complained about everything, she refused to eat at places I can get food ( I’m vegan) she only wanted meat places. She whinged about how sore her feet were and how this ‘wasn’t a holiday’ because she wasn’t relaxing, she pulled my brother away from us for ‘private time’ the WHOLE TIME. 
And just constantly put a large black cloud over our whole trip. 

Then, just as they were leaving after their 2 weeks my brother suggests we buy an extra suitcase so he can take any stuff back to Aus so we don’t have to lug too much around for the rest of the trip. 
Kind of him, as always! So we do that! 
....the night before they are leaving, she says she doesn’t want to take our case. 
Which means we have to pay $50 per suitcase for the rest of the trip, which is 6 more flights x3 suitcases at $50 which is about $900 extra because we have an extra suitcase. 
She obviously won’t confront me about it so I have to privately chat with my brother and convince him to do the right thing and he eventually agrees he did already say he would do it so he will...

But then as soon as he goes back to her it’s all over again and she says they won’t be taking it. 
So they don’t. 
And we are now stuck with a very expensive and inconvenient problem for the rest of our trip. 

When we get back to Aus I come home FUMING at my brother for allowing this to happen to us. 
But I decide, kicking and screaming won’t solve this and he won’t listen. I chat to my Mum and my Dad and they both agree that I should just discuss it with him. 
So I try, but at this point, she’s CONVINCED HIM that it should be me who apologises to her for treating her so badly in America. 
... 
I’m getting so angry thinking about this now. 

I obviously disagree and we fight and part ways. 

Since then, my parents have taken their side, not given a shit about how hurt I am that this is happening to our relationship. 
It’s been just over a year since we go back from America, and I haven’t spoken to my brother. 
I’ve tried getting coffee and texting him a bit but he’s not interested. 
She has literally pushed my out of my own family and my brother has let this happen. 

My Mum tells me to stop being so dramatic, but now that I’ve moved out, I go to my own Mums house and she is sitting in my seat, sleeping in my old bed with my brother, going to what is supposed to be my family outings and I’m not invited because I’m the problem?

I don’t know what to do. I’ve lost my brother and I’ve lost my family who are supposed to support me. If I didn’t have such an incredible partner I don’t know what I would have done. 
This horrible girl has taken almost everything from me. And now she’s talking to my Dad about how she wants to have kids already, SHES 24! 

My brother is at a point where he’s in a dead end job that he hates, still lives with Mum and has no money. 
And now she wants kids? 
Can you see the future of this? She gets pregnant, they go into massive debt for a house, she eventually gets shitty that he can’t afford anything for them and she can’t live her lavish lifestyle anymore. She leaves him, takes his money, takes his kids, and he has nothing and no one. 

I’m heartbroken. 
I can feel an actual hole in my chest where my relationship with my brother used to be. 
I’m watching this all happen to him and to me and my boyfriend totally agrees my dad totally agrees, but no one is hurting like me about it. 

I can’t let this person be the mother of my niece or nephew and the future downfall of my brother.

I’ll try anything! Voodoo! Black magic? Sell my soul to the devil? Hitman? Maybe just some good old fashioned fisty cuffs? 

Please help! 
What can I do? 


TLDR; My brothers girlfriend has ruined our relationship and I’m heartbroken, now she’s trying to ‘lock him down’ and have kids etc. What can I do?"

He’s the only one that can do anything with his life and he wants me to be a wait for it... art major. Who works at a super market. Some friend. I know when I hear even one of my classmates wanting to go to grad schools I give them advice such as going on reddit subs that give a lot of info and I’m glad for them, I don’t say well I think you aren’t good enough for it and there’s a lot of competition so it’s best if you major in BS that you don’t like and can’t be successful in because yadayada

Within 2 weeks he's with a new girl who uses with him....and who has now got him to start shooting up heroine. I had told him that if he would get help I would be with him forever and he said he didn't want that and seems so happy with this new girl.

17125,bek79y,ThisIsTosh,Living my worst life &amp; i want out,"Hello.
I am a 20 y/o female. I am a premedical student and have hopes to become a surgeon in the future. But I have hit a depressed state in my life. Growing up I lived a nice life. Family in a suburban home, middle class living. Unfortunately when I was a late teenager my parents passed away. 
So now I have only my income while in college which is very little because I’m always busy with classes and can’t work a full job.
I hate where I live. It’s infested with bugs. They are everywhere and I have tried everything to get rid of them. They go into the bed and I can not sleep. I have not slept in 4 days now because of this. 

To make matters worse there is a loud noise in my apartment that is now causing my ears to ring and gave me a terrible migraine.
And I hate my roommate (not trying to be mean) but he’s absolutely gross. He doesn’t even care about the bugs and he always leaves huge messes and is a hoarder.
School is important to me, I have a 3.9 gpa because I’m hoping to get into an Ivy League for med school. But my lack of sleep this week caused me to be to exhausted to study and I skipped an exam. 

I begged my boyfriend (who lives in a really nice home) if I can stay with him for a couple days to give me a break from this place. I truly just want to sleep. But I have a feeling he will say no because that’s just how he is. 
I have no where to go and my mental health is deteriorating.

I’m not saying I sound incompetent it’s just that I wish my standard of writing matched how I spoke. I did not go to a private school nor was I surrounded by “smart” people growing up, so I find myself struggling to match everyone else’s standard.

2668,dfqnkm,Percy0311,How do I stop taking problems home from my workplace?,"I don't know if this is even the right place to post this here since it's mostly vent. Basically,  a new coworker of mine made some off-hand comments about me always being late to work, (I usually get there one or two minutes before my shift starts, while he always arrives 10-15 minutes before, which I not find pointless) and I just find him personally very loud and uncomfortable to be around with in general. He also made a couple of flat out racist comments today at work about something on the radio, which no one but me seemed to mind, and I didn't speak up because I generally don't like drawing attention to myself.  Nobody else seems to have a problem with him, my other coworkers think he's a great fit for out team (and yes, he is a good worker and a very fast learner) which kinda makes me worry about my own position since I just started working there about six months ago and am very quiet and introverted myself. 
All that being said, I don't even want to care about any of that, and I don't know why I do. I just want to come home to my husband at the end of day, cuddle up on the sofa with our cat and not worry about what happened at work today or what's gonna happen tomorrow. I'm not letting that stress out on anyone, but having these things in the back of my mind just ruins the whole rest of my day.

tl;dr  I just want to leave the stress behind me as soon as I leave my workplace and just focus on my freetime without constantly worrying about work.

She told me about her problems regarding how she hates the fact that everybody hates her, family problems, the fact that she doesn't have anyone to talk to and stuff. So after that happened she was really into me like touching me hugging etc. But the catch is that she has done this before to just play with other guys. She claims that she has changed but idk whether that's true. To understand whether she is into me or not I started not giving her attention, avoiding her and stuff, talking and flirting with other girls. Whenever I did that I could see that she was getting uncomfortable , jealous you could say but I am not entirely sure. So I kept going until like see literally just hugged me and she was like why you don't hug me  and talk to me like you used to. So I started giving attention to her after that cause I was like ok she probs likes me. Then there was a party, and I really flirted with her and she flirted back. We were laughing hugging but nothing more. In the same party I flirted with other girls and whenever I did that she just came and hugged me or she playfully punched me to get my attention. We went for a walk and she grabbed my hand as if we were gf and bf. And the there was a time we stayed alone. We were laughing and everything but I feel like she never gave me the chance to make a move. After that she just stopped doing everything she did. And the worst part, a douchebag literally asked : ''WHY YOU DIDNT DO ANYTHING WITH HIM(him=me) '' to what she didn't really react and then I went to him and told him to fuck off. After that we haven't spoken and when she left the party she was the coldest she is ever been torwards me. We still exchange memes and react to them like haha and stuff but we re not talking like we used to. Some of my friends say that she just wanted to play with me or that she just wanted me to like her and nothing more. .Those friends also call her a slut though so I believe they are biased against her. Did she just play me? Does she just wants me to like her but not be with me? What should I do guys I really don't know and it's really making me sad cause I really like her and I believed that she changed but after... Idk. Is it me? Like did I take too long to make a move?

21473,arip7w,10cd,Yet another friend crisis where objective advice is needed,"For context I’ve been friends with these people for around 15 years.

So there are about 10 of us in a friendship group. I recently got really close to somebody who I previously wasn’t despite being in the group for the last 3-4 years, so much so I was asked to be his best man at the wedding. This, as far as I can tell is where the shit show started. 

Fast forward.

I was at a party with 2 of the guys yesterday including my newer close mate who’s getting married and their partners. It transpired that another 2 people in the friendship group had said unkind things about the soon to be married friend. They were having a conservation that was around shall we get rid of them from being groomsmen. I thought that was the end; it wasn’t.

My wife told me this morning that those 2 friends have a particularly unkind nickname for me behind my back; ‘4 hour 
10cd’ as they can’t stand being around me for longer.

The advice I’m wanting is how to proceed with this and how to get the unbiased facts. There are people in the group who I think I can still trust if you advise me to speak to one of them. I’ve already reached out and said I need to speak to someone. What would you ask?

How would you react if for example they are saying these unkind things?"
38358,7mvqj3,HighestMatthias,on Life,"I stared blankly at the screen for almost 5 minutes trying to come up with a title and a nice summary of what I'm trying to ask. 

I've undergone a lot of personality and moralistic changes over the years. These changes have brought me these feelings of weightlessness and empowerment. However, I've noticed that I am now a lot less likable than when I was, say, 16 or 17 (I am now just about 22).

I was diagnosed with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) when I was 15. I struggled with self-esteem issues that largely had to do with being homosexual. Once I had analyzed myself enough and finally forced myself to confront my truth, I realized that I was my own biggest obstacle - and, looking back on it, people seemed to be *drawn* to that. 

To summarize, I was the kid that everyone knew *of*, but hardly anyone *knew*. I was so caught up in my own mind that I didn't see how easy I could've made my adolescent and teenage social lives. 

Now that I feel as though I've removed (or at the very least, deconstructed) this self-made anchor, people seem to become *repelled* by the new way I carry myself. I am no longer pitiable, or even cute. The phrase ""misery loves company"" was never so relevant before in my life. Since this change, I've found it harder to maintain a social life, and can count my friends on one hand. Though, I don't see that as a bad thing.

I want to know how to passionately pursue what I desire, attain the know-how to do so, and make and foster new friendships. I've noticed as I've entered the doors to adulthood, adults are not nearly as friendly as children. I feel as though I've retained some of my inner child, though I've let most of it go due to me associating it with depression and misery.

Is there some sort of formula you guys might have had to achieve financial independence? How do you keep yourself motivated? How do you tear down emotional walls built with trauma and let new people in? "

27834,8pzi6h,MeowCows56,"Please help, creepy 18-year-old guy will not leave me alone (F16)","I don’t usually post on reddit, but I really need some help. I’m sorry this is long, I’m desperate.

I am a sixteen-year-old girl. I have been attending these extra-curricular classes about twice a week for four years now. I’m the second oldest there, with the oldest being an 18-year-old guy. I’ll reference him as “CG” (Creepy guy) to keep this less confusing.
CG’s been there longer than I have. Ever since I met him four years ago I was creeped out by him. CG has always followed me around the class. If I went one direction suddenly, CG would quickly follow. He would always try to sit and stand next to me no matter what. My two closest friends (K and C) have both noticed this. 

CG is a very physically aggressive person (I have reason to believe he has anger issues). He is very large and taller than me. He does odd things, like putting on a (bad) Russian accent for no reason and making violent threats towards people. He’s also never had a girlfriend (he tells us all that quite a lot and is quite angry about that). I’ve always been quite uncomfortable around him, but I was always polite when he spoke to me (I never made an effort to talk to him though). Unfortunately, as of this year I have had to get to these classes early. CG has started coming early to “keep me company”. He’ll patrol up and down the street until he spots my car arrive, then he’ll follow me inside. I always figured he had a bit of a crush on me, but I thought it’d hopefully go away if I was very careful not to lead him on.

A few weeks ago, CG asked me out before class. I told him I was dating another boy (also 16) in the class. CG hadn’t known prior as my boyfriend and I hadn’t made a big deal out of it (due to us not wanting some kids in the class to know). He got quite intimidating but, my boyfriend arrived shortly after and it was okay.

However, ever since CG has been very persistent about being near me. I’ve become quite afraid of him. He has been getting quite close to me. No matter how carefully I plan where I sit or stand, he will (very obviously) move to be next to me. I’ve already notified my teacher, and I’ve asked her to not put us in groups together. This doesn’t stop him from coming near me though. He has been getting increasingly closer to me over these few weeks. I’ve tried to ignore him by rambling on and on to C and K. They’re also trying to get between him and me. He still tries to force his way between us though.

CG is stronger than me, and I’m terrified he might try to touch me. I suffer panic attacks and I don’t know if I would be able to adequately stop him if we were alone. C and my boyfriend both think that it won’t come to that (they both think CG is a kind person), but K is also very worried.

7282,cr1wfc,The_Circus_Lady,How do I tell my crush I’m not a lesbian?,"So.  I like a guy right now (lets call him John) and we see each other a lot (classes, hanging out with friends, etc).  Our friend group, which includes both me and John, and everybody’s always making gay jokes about each other.  (Don’t worry, these jokes are never malicious or meant to hurt anyone, and everybody is ok with them and makes them). I am bi, so I occasionally bring up some of my old crushes, most of whom are girls.  In fact, it just so happens that I’ve never brought up any old male crushes of mine around him.   Just a weird coincidence.  In the past, John has made some comments about how his friends always make gay jokes, and how they themselves are gay.  He didn’t drop any names, but I’m worried that he might have been talking about me.  He might just possibly think I’m a lesbian, and that I only like girls.  I don’t.  I like both.  What would you guys consider to be the best strategy for subtly letting him know that I’m interested in guys as well?"

7410,cql14p,bigtina92,My cat killed a mouse and now he’s acting weird,"So I need some help here because I don’t know what to do. Or what my cat is trying to tell me.

My boyfriend and I just got our first apartment together. After about 1 month, and everything was settled down, we moved my cat in with us. Ralph is a 4 year old Maine Coon. He’s extremely loving. 

So Ralph is with us for a week and we have one particularly nice day over the weekend. So we opened all the windows and our sliding door (they all have screens). 

Then Sunday night I hear him chirping and sliding around everywhere in our bedroom. I turn on the light and he has a dead mouse! I was shocked cause 1. I am a very clean person so I was so surprised there was a mouse in the apartment.  And 2. I don’t know how it even got in here. 

We mustard it up to bad ventilation and maybe having our windows / doors open all day wasn’t the best idea. So then Monday night comes and Ralph is laying on our bedroom floor just staring under the dresser. 

So I’m thinking “ok that’s where the mouse was so he thinks there is more” 
 
Everyone goes to sleep and that’s it. 
Tuesday night he’s back in the same spot. So I ignore it and go to bed. Then at 2:30AM, he has another dead mouse?! 

So now I’m like “I need to call my landlord in the morning” 

This morning we think we found how the mice were getting in so my boyfriend blocked it off with steel wool and insulation. So we figured we didn’t need to get in touch with our landlord.

Now I am laying in bed and Ralph was in bed with us- as soon as I turned off the light he jumped off and resumed his spot in front of the dresser.

Does he know if there are more mice? Obviously cats have great senses and are so much more alert. 

I’ve never had mice though so I’m trying to understand his behavior to asses the problem. 

I should mention he’s been an indoor cat since he was a kitten.

I felt guilty at the time and that guilt has only gotten worse since discovering that they spent 3 months trying to fill my role and they want to train me up for the long-term. Because I took the job knowing I wouldn't stay I would like to give them as much notice as possible so I don't leave them in the lurch, but given that there are only 8 months until I go I also want to have been here long enough that it doesn't feel like I only just got here (so the training hasn't been wasted) or that I clearly never planned to stay in the first place. I want a good reference from them and I don't want me colleagues to feel like I've been lying to them about my long-term plans (even though I have). I get this sudden rush of guilt whenever anyone says ""Next year we can do this"" when in my head all I can think is ""I'M NOT GOING TO BE HERE!!!!!""

What's the best approach?"

I will call my friend “A” and the guy “B.” B has been acting really clingy to her, as in whenever they see each other, he engulfs her in a huge bear hug and often jokingly refuses to let her go. If her hand is ever free, as in not holding or doing anything, even if she is crossing her arms or something, he grabs it. Now, I have talked to A about it and asked if they are in a relationship. She said they are not. I asked B about it, and he said they are not as well, but he would like to be. I’ve known B longer than she has, and he has some issues. He has very little verbal boundaries, such as saying “You could cut the sexual tension in the room with a knife” when a whole group of my friends and I were having very normal conversation, and none of us are in any form of romantic relationship. He also asked me and A our “favorite sexual positions” completely casually as if he was asking about the weather. Me and A have never been in a relationship, but B seemed completely serious. 

I’m a little worried about A. B seems really unstable, and I don’t know what to do about it, if I should do anything at all. Maybe I shouldn’t interfere at all, and I would just be meddling. Your help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

Like no matter what I say or any idea I think of they will support whatever is the opposite of it. 

For example we are very gaming people but recently the ps4 controllers of the college ps4s were stolen, and I suggested that we could pool our money to buy a $60 ps4 controller now to use ourselves since we couldn't play without it now and we're gonna share it next year anyways, might as well buy it now. Im being very reasonable but they immediately jumped on the idea to demolish it saying how that's a bad idea, just buy it next year, or get it myself, completely non-sympathetic to my idea, one guy literally said to me he didn't like the idea just because it was me who said it. 

Now I'm thinking how will I be able to live with them for the next two years if I just realize how negative they are to me and if they keep rejecting my ideas just because it was me who said it.

So what can I do, just buy the controller myself and use it myself? I understand that we are all still stupid stubborn teenagers and they might have their own demons to battle, such as their family, exams, stress, girlfriends. What can I do to make them understand how their negativity is really hurting and frustrating me, as I'm trying to be the bigger person but it is really hard and the easy road would be to become selfish."
35178,7xep62,savalana,The dreaded in laws,"This is going to be really long but basically boils down to how do I get my lazy in laws off their fucking asses?

My husband has to travel for work and this time was a several months long thing and I didn’t want to live alone with our daughter cause I never signed up to be a single mom; which I basically am. So hubs suggested moving in with his mother and sister and to make everyone’s life easier. Another adult in the house for the heathen nephews and two more adults to help with the toddler. I’ve mostly gotten along with them so I didn’t think it was going to be horrible. I had roommates in college so I thought I could do this.
Fucking nightmare. I’m paying rent and bills to live here. I buy almost all the groceries. They are not providing for either of us in any sense. They seem to think I’m the housewife and this is the 1950s. No lie, my mother in law came home from work today, sat down on the sofa, and didn’t help with shit. Dishes needed to be unloaded from the dishwasher and the drain rack, dinner needed to be made, and the toddler was screaming. Never fucking moved. Not a finger was lifted. I went grocery shopping today, took the kid to the doctor, scrubbed the bathroom, took out all the trash, and all sorts of other crap no one else ever fucking does like dust.
It’s something like this ALL the time.
I told hubs to tell his mom and sister to knock it off or I’d start charging to play the maid. He said he did. Not a fucking thing has changed. 
I *only* have another 6 weeks here but for fucks sake I’m ready to pack up and live in a van down by the river bc it would be preferable to this bullshit. It would have been easier if I had stayed by myself and been a single mom bc then it would only be two people not 6 people to clean up after and two disgusting kids that don’t ever wash their hands and bring home ALL THE CRUD EVER. My sister in law gave me a dirty look for spraying lysol when one of the cess pools brought home the flu. Really? I am a T1 diabetic and could die from complications from the flu. 
I may bite my damn tongue OFF of I bite my tongue any harder than I do most days.
I’m normally very nice and loving but I have had enough. I am snapping at my own daughter bc I am in a bad mood. I don’t have the energy to play with her bc I’m cleaning up after everyone else all the time. And my mother in law keeps telling me to just let it go and not let it bother me and to let it wait until tomorrow. Fucking disgusting. This from the woman that can just leave coffee grounds on the back of the sink and around the trash can when she empties her reusable coffee filter that has never seen soap... her cleaning day will NEVER come. I found a mixing bowl in the cabinet that looked like it hadn’t been used in a while in the cabinet when I first moved in. Went to use it to make dinner. Full of cobwebs and dead bugs. Told her about it and all she said was ‘hub’. Told her I wanted to get her help cleaning all the cabinets. Never happened. Ended up doing it on my own so my daughters bottles and cups could be in clean cabinets.

I am not OCD or a ‘clean freak’ at all. Just a mom that needs my daughter to have a clean, safe environment. And it would be nice if the two lazy cunts would help from time to time without giving me an eat shit and die look when I ask them for help."
9875,cefjgg,Reaper2256,Am I an idiot for leaving a very well-paying job?,"I’m a 20 Y/O M from Washington state. My dad got me a job at the place he works, doing pipeline testing. The company is based on the other side of the country, and the jobs are scattered everywhere, so I could be sent to any state at any given time with no days off for who knows how long. So far since I started in late October 2018 I’ve gotten a total of 3 breaks, adding up to about 20 days home in total. I make pretty good money, to the point where I can kinda buy most of the things I really want and have the capacity to save up for the things I can’t buy. Even more, if I stay for a few years I have the opportunity to eventually be promoted to a superintendent, who makes $630 a day (including per diem.) that’s obviously pretty great pay, the job is VERY easy, I’m pretty good at it, I generally don’t mind a lot of the people there, and I get to work with my dad which is nice.

I hate it though. I can’t stand being away from home for so long, I have no hobbies that can transfer over to other states as my main hobby is making music, and I can’t bring most of the things I have in my “studio” with me. I’ve never felt such a longing for just being able to come home at night and actually do something I enjoy. When I’m working we get up early, come home late, and go straight to bed, which IMO is actually the easiest way for me to cope with it since I don’t have to sit and think about how much of my life I’m already wasting away. I miss my brothers, and my mom, and my friends, and my music equipment and everything that I enjoy being stuck at the house, whilst I’m out in the middle of nowhere purely working.

I have a plan kind of, my parents want to go in halves on a big piece of property where I can build myself a house and they can get themselves a house as well. We’ve been through quite a few struggles in the past and felt like having our very own space (whilst still having enough space in between our living areas to be separate from each other) would be the ideal living situation for all of us. My plan was to:

1.) Get my car paid off

2.) Get the house paid off (it’s actually a 2-story pole building with an apartment on top and a studio on the bottom)

3.)Get X amount of dollars in savings

4.) Gather up all of the expensive music gear that I’ll probably ever need (I have a list, and that list comes to like $40,000 for now, but obviously it’s gonna be a “get something here-and-there thing throughout the time I’m employed here.)

That’ll probably take me like 3 or 4 years. After that the only bills I’d have would be my half of the property payment (unless I decide to pay my half off too) and my utilities/insurance/phone bill. After that, I guess I’d quit and find a normal job that pays less but lets me have time at home to life a normal life. I just feel like people look at me funny when I talk about leaving this place. They always say “you’re young and you’re not tied down and you can travel and stuff” and I understand where they’re coming from, but I want to live an actual life, not dedicate 20 years entirely to this thankless company. Will I regret leaving?



TL;DR: I make great money at a company that has long term opportunities but I hate that I have to travel and sacrifice having a life with my family and friends to work here. I have a plan, (paragraph 3) to pay things off and then quit. Would I be making a mistake?"

a follow up paper said mice with damaged ears lost 60% of their respiratory drive to CO2, meaning 60% of the cells responsible for telling the body to breathe were gone, which is called ''Ondine's Curse'' where I could stop breathing during sleep, and not wake up since your body needs to sense CO2 to wake up and according to those papers, those sensors are in the hair cells of your ears."

He's been able to make the payments on time so far, but the dental business isn't doing very well right now and things don't look good. 

My parents are about to burn through the last of their savings account to keep up with these payments. They were told that if he misses even one payment, the IRS will take everything - the business, their house, their cars. They can't afford to take out any more loans, so that's no longer an option. 

My mom, who has taken over the financial side of the business since finding out about the payroll tax mishap, is extremely depressed and suffers from regular anxiety attacks. She barely sleeps anymore and is on a mix of anti-depressants and sleeping pills at any given time to combat her extreme anxiety. My dad is also on anti-depressants but he's better at putting on a brave face and staying optimistic. I'm really worried about them financially but more so I'm worried about their mental health. Neither of them have many close friends anymore due to their stressful life and my mom refuses to go to therapy because its 'too expensive'. Yesterday she put her car on Craigslist in an act of desperation to come up with some cash. She absolutely hates this job, but she feels trapped. I'm sure my dad feels trapped too.

I'm recently financially independent, but not to the point where I can help them out. My older brother has offered to cover them next month, but he can't afford to take on any more burden than one month. 

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation before? What the hell do I do? I feel guilty living far away from them. I can't bear to watch them struggle like this any longer. It's really bumming me out and causing me to feel second-hand anxiety.

I started at this company as an intern and was hired on to work part time after that. I started full time after college about 7 months ago. Total, I have been in this position for a year and a half and with the company for over two years.

I applied for a promotion at my company 3 months ago and was turned down as they found someone with a senior role to fill it. Not entirely relevant, but had I known they were looking for a senior role, I would not have applied.

After being turned down I started applying for positions outside of my company. Right after I had a couple interviews externally, this same position was opened again a few weeks ago. I applied, and was turned down again.

The person they gave the position was in the same role as me.

I am going to continue searching for jobs elsewhere. However, in the meantime, I am finding it very difficult to stay motivated in my current role when I feel my work isn't paying off for promotions to be given to people with less experience and exposure than I have.

As the title says. I think this is not normal

For example, I have a dayoff today. This morning I was productive for updating my website, but from the afternoon to the night I did nothing other than eating sleeping resting and watching movies with my wife and now I am ready to sleep but with guilty feeling for doing nothing productive.

I was trained this way by my parents since my childhood. Even when I was sick, if I was just laying in bed they would yell at me for doing nothing, even though they clearly knew I was sick.

Now I am an adult and this has been bugging me. This makes me unable to enjoy leisure time such as dayoff or vacation.

Is this normal?

If not, how can I cure myself from this?

Please advise

Thank you"
3408,dbsswx,SwordnBoard291,Help with asking for a raise,"Hello all. I'm not sure if this is the right place or anything, but I could use some help in some fashion. 

Quick overview: I'm 32 and stuck in my parent's house due to a combination of things, mainly my overprotective mother needing support from my alcoholic father. I want to move out on my own, but I don't think I make enough money to support getting an apartment. 

I work an hourly position for a company (everyone else works for salary, I've been hourly since I started) where I do computer work for a variety of buildings we have throughout the country. I do website updates, edits, map editing, and a variety of other things. I've been there for five years. Four of those years, I have gotten a small increase in pay, but last year I was told I 'didn't work hard enough' to warrant a pay raise. I was running out of work to do and had put on my own self review that I needed more responsibility. 

Long and the short of it, I want to ask my boss for a significant pay raise or promotion so I can make enough to move out of my parent's house. I'm hesitant to look for other work because I feel I'm unqualified for it. I just need to get out of this hell hole. Any advice on how to approach my boss with this would be appreciated. 

TL;DR: How do I ask my boss of five years to give me more money?"

My gf’s mother is the sweetest person on the planet, she’d give you the shirt of your back so you had a spare. I can’t be in a room with her without wanting to break the room, for several reasons:

1. She’s a hardcore baptist. I’m an atheist. She knows this, and has been told by gf to back off, but constantly bowls me over with her religion. She tells me to pray, to read the Bible to solve sleep issues, etc.. 

2. She overreacts to EVERYTHING. She doesn’t have to, it’s not like she can’t handle it, she just literally acts as though things going wrong mean the earth will explode. 

3. She panics over nothing constantly and refuses to listen to reason until someone bucks up the courage to tell her to stfu and listen, and gets whiny about it.

4. She sings. Constantly. Nonstop, not songs, nonsense. No tune, no rhyme, just jabbering in what could be considered a musical way by only the deafest of living things. 

5. She has major body issues that the whole family enables. Every so often someone will force her to eat but she acts like it’s torture, and refuses to do anything about it. (Once at dinner, half a taco. *HALF*)

6. Everything is attributable to Jesus. Bread baking right. Surgeries. Things that she asks people to do are done because ‘Jesus helps’.

I called back the same day after my app ( they put a new cast on) because I ask a question about my cast, the Dr got on the phone and told me he sent my x rays to another Dr and he said he thinks it can heal without surgery we just have to keep a close eye on it, and make sure it doesn't shift anymore. But MY Dr said in the long run surgery is going to be the best.

Some things that im hesitant on about surgery( pros and cons)

Said housemate never talks to any other residents about this and will immediately go to the agent to file a complaint.

Im pretty sure that most agents would tell her to deal with it on her own, but mine doesn't for some reason. And she's the head of the real estate agency so there isn't anyone higher up.

10841,c9l2rx,pazzapaz,My mum got beaten up by my neighbour and I want revenge,"So here’s the context, this was 7 years ago when I was in Secondary 1. 

My mum has been dealing with some depression ever since I was young and we since we had issues with the previous neighbours, we moved. So in this neighbourhood, my mum’s condition did not improve and worsened as she start hearing how my next door neighbour (literally 2 metres away) was talking shit about her to other neighbours in the area. [note 1: I do not know whether it’s true if this neighbour was talking shit about her due to her condition]

So one fine day, my Sister didn’t come home and only came home in the morning and this neighbour happened to walk past my house [note 2: I live on the first floor]. He was already triggered by my mum “accusing” him of talking shit about her and moved out with his Wife and children but happened to be come by his mother’s house aka my neighbour to grab some things. Since my Mother was scolding my Sister, he thought that my Mother was shouting at him, he shouted some vulgarities towards my apartment. 

My mum always said that he has been “kicking our door” and that when he shouted at my apartment, my mum got really triggered and went to kick his house door. He came out of his house and shouted right outside of our door (can’t remember the context) and even came up to the steps towards my door [note 3: there is 4 steps leading up to my door] 

Out of natural reaction, my mum was afraid that he would open my door and charge to attack us since he was getting really aggressive. I don’t know why but she opened the door and attempted to “push him” away BUT he managed to drag her out of my house and she rolled down the steps and as she got up, he PUNCHED her and she fell into the drain [note 4: the drain is about 2 metres from the steps]

As I was standing right infront of the door, and witnessed this. As a secondary 1 student I was so defenceless but I had to defend my mum from being continuously attacked as he launched a few more hits on her. I did not remember this but somehow I managed to scratch him real hard and he actually pushed me towards the wall by dragging me by my hair. My mum wanted to protect me when I tried to protect her so through the confusion I had no idea how many times we were pulled and pushed and how many times my Mother was hit. 

All of a sudden, my eldest Sister came out of the house and landed a metal spatula on his head. He only stopped after he realised he was bleeding, and said words in Chinese “woah you brought weapon” lol I salute my sister for her quick thinking because she could have brought out a knife and stabbed him but she could be charged for that. My Sister was 17. 

Few weeks passed and we all made police reports since there were injuries and both parties went to the hospital. My mum had her nose broke and I have picture evidence of her bleeding and I will forever remember how her eyes looked like. Filled with fear yet she had to put up a tough front of her children. The guy had some stitches idgaf.

Months passed and police advised us to go for mediation session so that we do not have to go to court. My family belongs to the Low income group so we do not have the funds for any legal proceedings. My eldest Sister and I had to go for the session as well since we were witnesses. 

During the session, my mum appeared to be very mentally unstable because of the trauma she faced and blabbered some irrelevant information to the mediator which I believed caused a bad impression of her. Whereas the guy, about mid 40s, 1.7+m, had a company of his own, no idea how big the scale is, threatened us that he has the means to go through a legal process aka SUE us LOL 

What enraged me the most is that the whole duration he denied the fact that he landed a finger on any of us, when my family side admitted to everything that happened. He even insulted my Mother. It was worse when the mediator was not even trying to listen and made it seem like we are making a fuss trying to seek for justice to be served. Eventually they settled the issue since no one wants to waste money on a lawsuit and his Mother was still our neighbour.

I’m 20 years old now and recently I got reminded of this fking guy who punched my mum. Because of this, my Mother was so traumatised and for years, her condition worsened so badly she was diagnosed for schizophrenia, “hearing” his voice everywhere. She gets nightmare for it. And to me, justice is not served. What kind of guy lays his hand on a woman? AND CHILDREN. 

I need advice. I don’t want to put this behind. I cannot forgive. He ruined the peace in my house. I know he has children similar age of mine. I don’t know their names, but I know his. What should I do?"
10525,cb451g,scaredepressed,Do I have attachment issues?,"Do I have attachment issues?

I  have been in a relationship for almost 5 months now, and it's been  probably the bumpiest relationship I have ever been in. We're complete  opposites, but we work well in different ways. We have almost broken up a  handful of times and all of my friends agree that she treats me like  absolute garbage and that they don't understand how I haven't dumped her  yet.

Me neither.

I  know what heartbreak feels like and I know that after the two first  initial weeks of breaking up with her or vise versa, I would feel really  hurt, but then it would be okay. So I don't think it is that, that is  stopping me.

I  can spend days with her, and not get sick of her. Then literal minutes  after leaving her house or her leaving mine, I am overwhelmed with an  instant feeling of sadness and anxiety because I miss her. Like yes,  missing somebody is normal, but STRAIGHT away? Isn't that wrong? She is  on my mind basically 24/7, I am always always wanting to talk to her  which I know is unhealthy so I don't push that on her at all, but  personally I am just wanting to always be with her and always talk to  her.

We  can be texting completely fine, but if I feel like her mood has changed  or that she's starting to text differently, my brain will start  completely overthinking and I'll feel like I'm doing something wrong.

I  feel like I would do the ABSOLUTE most for this girl, although I have  never been treated worse, or not been in a relationship quite like this  one.

There's probably more I could add to this but I feel like this is enough to get a general gist of things.

So reddit, do I have attachment issues?"

What should I do?,"My boyfriend [M20] and I [F19] have officially been together for 5 months, and it immediately became a serious, hopefully long-term relationship. I met his mother and stepfather fairly early on, and had a seemingly good relationship with both of them. She is a very strict Catholic (which I have zero problem with, as I too was raised Catholic). I had been around my boyfriend maternal aunt and her husband a number of times and even spent Thanksgiving at their farm with the family. I was very concerned about them liking me as it's important to me to have a positive relationship with them.

Fast forward a few months and my boyfriend and I were broaching the possibility of having sleepovers at each others' houses (we both still live with our parents). He said after a long conversation, his mother agreed if he slept on the couch, and because of that my parents begrudgingly agreed so on the weekend, my bf slept on one couch while I slept in the adjacent one. I guess he forgot to text his mom or fell asleep before he got a chance to, and we woke up to a number of angry texts, which I found reasonable and understandable. He apologized and we got on with our day, and I thought it was over.

My parents told me that night that his mother was sending them anti-abortion videos via email and wanted to have a conversation with them. Yesterday evening, my boyfriend and I got home from my work and found his mother just leaving my house. I was confused but figured she just wanted to talk about the sleepover. The next day my mother pulled me aside and asked if I had been intimate with my bf and I said yes I had, why are you asking. She proceeded to tell me what my BF's mother had said.

His mother said that she went through her 20 year old son's trash in his bedroom and found a used condom. She expressed that she did not want us to be having sex and her worst fear was me becoming pregnant. She told my mother she should ""march your daughter down to the doctor and get her on the birth control pill."" She also said that her sister, my BF's aunt, said I am very sexual and I don't know how to behave around my boyfriend in public, which is completely untrue. His mother said she had to stop us from being inappropriate at the table while we were playing cards with them, which my boyfriend was appalled about. 

She went on to say that she doesn't believe in abortion and would never encourage her son to leave me if I became pregnant. She then asked my mother how my older sisters marriage's are, which, in my opinion is radically irrelevant. According to her, her son and I are spending too much time together and I just think she thinks I'm taking him away from her. 

I am mortified and embarrassed (even though I feel like I did nothing wrong). I am beyond angry and extremely hurt as I have been nothing but respectful to her. My boyfriend and I are adults and our decisions should be respected, and I deserve to be treated with respect. My own mother respects and trusts my choices so I have never dealt with this. I am still shocked and discussed this with my boyfriend yesterday, who is very angry and feels disrespected. I don't know what to do from here. My instinct is to sit down and express my feelings of betrayal and anger of how she spoke about me and judged me, but I don't know if there is any point as she seems to be stuck in her ways. 

I feel like I can never be around her family out of fear of being judged. This is also extremely triggering because of my past so I'm having trouble figuring out how to be objective. Please help!!!

**TL;dr: my boyfriend's mom slut shamed me to my mother and I don't know how to talk to her about it.**"
23357,9dcerh,Kyrstyy,Am I the problem?,"My brother in law (not actually but we all act like me and my BF are married) and his girlfriend just broke up a month or two ago. I’m very good friends with his GF and have been for years, but right after they broke it off she began sleeping with a lot of men and doing things that I wouldn’t put online. He has no idea of any of this, and still loves her (I think) Right now they are camping outside with their 2 year old because his family HATES her very much after what she’s put him through and although she is not completely to blame, the family doesn’t see it that way. Their relationship was very toxic and she had been trying to end it for months. 

It upset me that she decided to come over tonight because we all know the one reason why. He doesn’t know about the other men and she is my good friend so I don’t think it’s my place to say anything, but it just feels all wrong.

He did some pretty horrible things when they broke up including messaging her little sister for you know what. She knows this, but doesn’t seem to care anymore. Do I voice my concerns to her more than I already have? Or do I step back and let this disaster start up again? I’m not exaggerating when I say they’re are toxic to each other. I love them both and want them to be happy, but I don’t think being together is a good idea. Pleeease help me butt out of this or butt in more I’m not sure what to do. "

Im a firm believer in doing what you love for less, but at the same time, as I approach 30, I’m making great money that I’ve never seen before and I really feel like I’m growing up for the first time as I’m finally able to make grown up purchases.

Well my bff had invited me to hang out for a few hours after I got work , and because I was free I agreed, I stopped by and told my boyfriend at his work on my way to see him (so he wouldn’t  think I was sneaking around) and he flipped out, he asked if I was going to see him every time he’s at work(I’ve seen him literally 4 times this year) and I said no, but I might sometimes because it’s better then sitting at home alone, he then says that my hanging out with my bff is just as disrespectful as if he would start hanging out with my very sexually abusive ex (who is also a registered sex offender) and I was like “only my bff never raped you!” And he said yeah but he’s done other stuff and it’s just as bad.  
My boyfriend new me and my bestie where very close when we started dating, this was definitely not something that was a surprise, and they where great friends too before, which is why I don’t believe most of the stuff he claims happened.

72,ek0a97,Nassorie,Introverted dude trying to change..but how?,"Hey there! first a little bit of context (excuse me for my English) 

I am a 28 year old, and..really introverted. I had peace with it for the majority of my life. But now, everytime I just stay at home, instead of doing something else with my time, i'd hate myself for it. I wanna be more social, I wanna do more stuff than just stay at home and avoiding people. 

Because I am this way, I basically pushed all my friends away, since I always chose the option to stay at home rather than to go out (especially if there were people who I didnt know). And I regret that so much, also I'm not who to contact people, in my mind I always felt like I was bothering them. And well, my friends were introverted a bit as well. 

But I know now, how happy it makes to interact with people, how fullfilled I feel just to do something, and I wanna do so many things, that I havent been able to expercience because of  my introverted ways.

I am basically alone now, little family, no real life friends, also no co workers whom can do something with me, they're all so much older than me, and because of the age gap many interest don't align with me or them. 

So, I go out alone, to the cinema, to eat out alone, mountain biking alone, and ..well feels loney you know? at those places everyone you see is already in a group and stuff...and its pushing me back to home, I dont feel same enjoyment alone as I do when I with other people. And now i'm back at the start, I lost hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the point to this whole story is, how I can change? Nothing will change for me, if I don't change myself. But I dont know how anymore, even afraid of it. I see so many people with friends, hanging out, and i'm envious of that. I wished countless times I wasnt like this, I wished I was someone else, yet I cant deny it. But i'm hoping there is way, or mabye a piece of advice which will open my eyes! How you do overcome your introverted ways? Once I open up and feel comfortable I become a very spontaneous guy whom won't shut this trap easily, just the steps to it ..are big."

12436,c1e0em,idlesingularity,university has me fucked up and I'm terrified to go back,"I have to decide really soon whether I want to go back to uni or take a year off, cuz if I decide to go back I need to find a place to live real soon. 

I just finished my first year, and it was literally the worst year of my life. lonely as fuck, went through a horrible breakup, experienced major seasonal affectiveness disorder &amp; just regular ol' depression &amp; anxiety. heavily self medicated with weed. I have absolutely no clue how I managed to pass all my classes because I barely attended them, or did any work. I also have no clue what I wanna major in or do with my life. 

The thing is, I have no fucking clue what I would even do if I took a year off. I'd have to live at home, which means a lot less freedom than having my own place at uni. I would probably find some min wage job and work through the year. I'm scared that I'll end up doing nothing with the time and feeling even more horribly depressed &amp; isolated than I would have at school. I would like to travel but I dont know if my parents would let me (18f, and I think they see me as pretty naive lol) run off on my own. or what I'd even do if they let me. 

not sure if I should give uni another go and attempt to actually put effort into this year, and then reevaluate my situation at the end of the year, or if I should take some time off and attempt some self discovery...? I'm quite introverted and scared that I will get super lonely if I dont go to school because I really struggle with making friends.

sorry this sounds so fucking whiney and depressing but I really am so beyond confused and lost. I do see a therapist but it hasn't helped me on coming to a decision on this front. I really just need some well meaning advice cuz man this has seriously been such a difficult year for me, and even though I'm grateful for how much it has taught me, I feel so fragile, scared, and hopeless.

I work 8 hrs a day. 40 hrs a week. I have no ex wife or kids.I really enjoy gaming. Been doing it all my life. PS4 and now just recently a PC.

These used to be great as I got to spend time with my dad (as i admitadly have a very distant relationship with). But recently when I come over he's gone from sunrise to sunset and only comes home to eat dinner. He works two jobs, he's a civil engineer and a relestate agent on top of that. I think its insane and that hes working himself to death. Meanwhile while he's working his two jobs me and my brother are just stuck at home all day with our stepmom and step brother. Along with that there's a big elephant in the room.

 My stepmom is very obviously pregnant, shes gained a lot of weight and has a bottle of prenatle vitamins laying on the counter. My father has never been very open (he didnt even tell me he remarried i found out when he pulled us into his house and there was a random lady there) because he doesn't want my mom knowing about his life but I thought he at least he would tell me. I'm hurt that he wants to be this closed off from me about this. 

Also he never shuts up about the divorce and how horrible it was and how it was my ""bitch of a mother's"" fault. He acts like I wasn't there and that I don't rember him hitting my mom. He was always an abusive and shitty husband to my mom and never took responsibility for it. He always balmes our uncle or aunt or my mom or ect. 

I'm also scared to tell him im majoring in history. He doesnt support me being anything but a docotor (he's indian) so whenever he asks what im majoring in collage i get scared and lie to him.

30334,8dte2j,A-S1000,Advice for a Lost 22 years old medical student have stammer,"Hello , 
My story is long and I really need a help .. If you think you can advice me please read it .
I am 22 years old  living in syria .. medical student and this my story ..
I have  stammer "" like  The king in King's Speech movie "" , living in syria with stammer is not good .. most people think you can't speak because you are scare and we know that is not true .
just to make this thing clear : a lot of people think if you have stammer  that mean you have a problem in your brain and thats make you stupid .. I am not stupid ( my friends and family say I am clever ) But I cant judge my self if I am clever or  not  .. anyway I know I am not stupid .. maybe you should know I won first place in chess tournament every time I participated  ( I just say that to make it clear that stammer have no link to I.Q . )
NOTE : I tried a lot to solve stammer problem but its like something temporarily and partially recoverable , not completely and permanently cured .
Being stammer  make me concern about my future .. always asking myself what I should work ? when I was 18 I finished the baccalaureate at a rate of 99.5% which mean here in syria I can study medicine ( in syria in that time you should get about 98.8% to study medicine ) because medicine here is  the most work make money and it has  a special kind of social value  (  I'm talking about The syrian culture ) , so I think a lot , then I said ok anyway  I have no desire to study anything else also no desire  to study medicine but its the best here so why not ?
Not a long time after I  realized that is no way for me to be a doctor .. I tried to think ( noo this is stupid you are smart and you can ) but let be honest I have no chance in this .. talking is a major thing in being a doctor cause you need to  rest assured the patient and  speak, cooperate and consult  with other doctors .. and maybe you will not have enogh time ! maybe it's an  emergency  !  when you intend to be a doctor you cant look like scare or you dont have the reliable answear for  your  patients .. you cant go to the  operations room and then start to talk stammering . 
you can't work in hospital and if you have your own clinic 90% of patients will not feel good to come to you 
I know that because I know people dont understand stammer and mostly will never do !
Conclusion : a person who have stammer like me have no chance to be a doctor (  take into consideration  that stammer vary from person to person and in my case it's bad enough  to prevent me to be a doctor .
I made my decsion I will not move back , I will get the graduation certificate and I will work in something else .. its not bad idea , in the end I am a doctor no one care if I am work as a doctor or not !
During that I fall in love with one of my colleagues , and we intend to marry when we get 23 , I swore that I will do anything to marry her so I will start working now , and that's what happened ,
 I got a great job opportunity  ( which I knew it will not last long ) so I started work hard with my study .. study medicine with full time work is not easy especially when living in syria where war is  in full swing , but I was ready to  Make the effort that it takes .. 3 years and I barely sleep barely  have a rest and I was ok with that because I was know this work will not last long .
After 3 years the work is over , I got some good cash cause I was trying to save as much as possible ( about 40k usd )
yeah it's a very good money in 3 years here in syria .
After that I intended to buy a shop and start my own work  .. 40k is not enough so I requested a debt from my old boss and because he worked with me for 3 years which make him know me good enough , he said yes and gave me 20k , He said I should pay back in 1 year and I agreed .
I bought a shop and found a supplier who accept to get paid after I start selling , he bring me goods worth about 3k .. work was very good so it took less than month to pay the 3k back , so he accept to raise the limit to 5k .. and in 3 months he suggested That  I should take large quantities and I can pay later , and I did ( about 10k ) . During this time I  saved 3k .
Not a long time later , an Explosion happend near my shop and I lost my shop and my goods .
I sold everything I can sell , I got about 4k + 3k I already saved , I paid them to the Supplier  and he tell he could wait sometime for the rest ( 3k ) but not a lot , my old boss told me will can't wait after the year end .
I AM NOT ASKING FOR MONEY , I Ask to advice me what should I do now after lost my work , my stock  and also have to pay 23k in 8 months ,  Taking into consideration normal jobs here pay 100-200$ monthly . Also I have no one  to lend me , banks here dont lend (they do but its not for me at least ) .
so let me make it clear :
1-  I have to pay 23k but I dont have a piaster of them + I dont have work + I dont have stock to start a work + any normal work here will pay 100-200$ monthly no more + my sweety stammer never allow me to work with 70% of works .
2- I have a lover who I promised her to merry her after 1 year ( and if you think this is not a real problem , let me tell you : it's most what I concern about and this love and promise mean to me a lot , and ofcurse it mean to her too ) , Last think I like to do in this world is to let down this girl .
3- Althought I am studying medecine but I cant work as a doctor .. and when you cant work using your university degree you have 2 choices : start your own work ( which need stock and I dont have it ) or work as worker which mean ( low Salary , no more than 200$ a month ) .
is there anything in the world I can do to save what rest of my life ?
Thanks in advance and please excuse my English it's not my first language ."

2 of my roommates hide in their room practically ALL the time. I have not even had a real conversation with one since they moved in 4.5 months ago.

I find this rather frustrating. Why are they so anti social? Can't they afford a smidgen of cordiality? I stipulated in my want ad that I wanted people who were engaged and interested in interacting at least some of the time. These people I basically never ever see, and it makes the house feel ghosty. 

Thankfully one out of the three is reasonably social though quite shy at first. But it bothers me that the others are so incommunicado. Even when we communicate about house matters over a facebook group chat, they give one or two word replies and put no energy in to it. It feels like an energy drain for me, because I was hoping to have people that cared AT LEAST a little bit, but these people are seriously ghosts.

I go to the sink to do some dishes and yup hes tugging away. Wtf can we do. It's in his house so I don't think police can shut it down..."
18457,b75pvz,WizardWiener,My girlfriends old friends visited and won't leave us alone! Any advice?,"Please bear with me, it's a read. 

My GF(19F) and I(21M) have been dating for almost a year now and I've never connected with someone like this before. We're practically connected by the hip from what people tell us and we've been talked about moving out of her aunt's guesthouse after my last year in community college and movement to Uni. 

GF has told me things about her past here and there but I never was able to grasp how atrocious it was until now.

A few days ago one of her ex's showed up with a group of people saying they were going to help her out of this and by this, I mean our relationship. At that time she wasn't home and the group of people referred to my GF as (subname) Brian and using male pro-nouns. After a few weird conversations I pieced together who these people were and that they were referring to my GF. I was calm and told them to come back when she gets back, they were frustrated that I said she as well as her birth name.  I found out later from my GF's aunt that these people used to be her best friends and how nutty they were. Pushing transitioning, drugs, drinking, sexual deeds, and just how they treated her leaving.  My girlfriend dropped them hard, moved to her home state, sought help for everything and eventually started dating me.

GF got back from work and then all hell broke loose. They begged her and went on yelling at each other for a long time and many of them blamed me for her leaving. Suicide was threatened and we ended up having to calling the police after they didn't want to leave. 

They've popped up every so often now and we think they're damaging our property. I'm had to scare them off a few times and every time they end up crying or yell that I'm keeping their friend hostage. We have no idea what to do besides catching them doing something on video for evidence. Any help??  "

29238,8ic2em,YesBunny,How does one look at porn while in a relationship?,"Like, when you're with someone, committed and you live with them.

How does that work?

My partner watches porn, whatevs. But he does it like, all the time it feels like? Or just whenever he wants to. It becomes really awkward, because he'll do it wherever, whenever he wants.

It becomes awkward because like sometimes I wanna go and say hey to him, or hang out with him and he's sitting there in the living room jerking it on the couch, or he'll be in his game room and I'll knock like a considerate person but it still feels awkward.

Is it too much for me to want some sort of schedule or verification like ""Hey, gonna go jerk off just so you don't awkwardly approach me.""

I'm his girlfriend, so it's not like I'm the mom bursting through invading his privacy. I'm doing girlfriend things, like wanting to have his company.

I feel like it's something maybe he should do while I'm asleep or out of the house? But he seems to do it completely randomly without warning or anything.

I've never lived with a guy before, so I'm curious how other couples handle it. Most people tell me he should want to have sex with me first, which like yeah I agree. But he doesn't. And that in itself is an issue... But I guess I'm just looking for opinions for future reference.

Also, am I weird to think that the way he does it can make it really easy for him to cheat? Because he closes his door, I knock, because realistically that would be the polite thing to do. But, even in a situation I left the bedroom once to go get a glass of water and walked in on him in the living room and he yelled at me saying I was ""trying to catch him in the act"" like it's not my fucking apartment too?

We aren't really working out, I just want to know other peoples' perspectives or experience with this subject.

It's strange, because I want to be a good girlfriend, but I also think there should be boundaries and communication to avoid suspicions of cheating and awkward encounters.

Also, if anyone pulls the whole ""Just join in."" It doesn't work that way, he doesn't really sleep with me much at all. And it's not exactly a turn on. Our relationship is kinda failing either way, but I know everyone masturbates even if they don't do it as much as he does so.


TLDR: My boyfriend jerks off at any time, randomly, sometimes a lot in a day and we live together so I walk in on him a lot. He gets upset, it makes me feel awkward and I'm just confused if this is normal and how other people deal with this stuff?"

TL;DR: I wish it were me and feel like I'll never be happy again. She was 33, I am 29. She's been my best friend for ten years. I doubt anyone will ever understand me or connect with me in the ways that she did. Three years ago, the doctors told us she had about twenty years left, which is why I let myself become absorbed in work and school, to try and reach a place where I could comfortably move back to southern California again and we could ""pick up where we left off."" That was the goal of leaving the state almost six years ago, but once I got here, I found I had resulting PTSD from my last job and had trouble finding steady full-time employment. Everything I did was geared towards getting back to where she was. Now I feel like the past six years were a mistake and my current life is a hopeful lie to myself.

That really did not wind up being an efficient use of TL;DR, but here we are. If someone can please help me believe that it will get better, I'd be willing to nix the suicidal thoughts long enough to consider it, at least. Yeah, I already know ""grief gets better in some ways but never does in others."" I know a day will come when I forget to think about her or hate myself less for my role in her suffering.

See the thing is, Office relationships are really the shittiest idea, sure they can work, but if they don't work out it can fuck up the actual team. and as a wise man once said 'Don't shit where you eat'. on top of that, the company is a family company and I'm part of the family (No she's not don't worry, this isn't THAT bad), that puts me in sort of a place where I bet it could seem.... way more malicious if i approach her then would be intended.

15463,bmwoyr,djrainbowpixie,Is this typical of a car shipment company? Paid fee for an exact shipment date that can't be honored.,"I'm shipping my car from the East coast to the West coast. I scheduled a car shipment to occur on May 13th and even paid an extra $100 to get it within a day or two of the exact date that I wanted. I won't get to the West coast until May 19th so I didn't want to ship my car too early. I explained my situation to the broker and he agreed that we should ship it around or after May 13th. I also warned him that the car cannot come before May 19th because no one will be there to pick it up.

This was booked about two months in advance. I signed a contract with a broker and the date of shipment (or first available date) on the contract was May 13th.

Two months later, broker emails me on May 8th saying, ""driver will be contacting you soon to schedule pickup."" No dates or times listed. I thought cool...we are getting closer to the date so makes sense that the driver will call me and confirm the May 13th date. I had some wiggle room for a day or two before or after that. I literally only replied ""Thanks!""

May 9th I'm out of town for my boyfriends graduation. I get a voicemail and missed call from a driver. Decided I will call him back after the graduation festivities. A hour later he calls again and I pick up. ""Can I pick up the car in about an hour?"" ""Uh...I actually scheduled it for May 13th."" ""I will only be in town today."" ""I can do it earlier than the 13th but I need a heads up. I can't make it there in an hour."" Driver gets pissed and said he has been trying to call me since yesterday. ""I have no voicemail or missed calls from you on yesterday. Only today. Plus I am out of town anyway."" Driver said I need to tell broker to rebook me with someone else. I happily agree. 

5 mins later broker and the dispatcher for the driver call me, pissed. Broker said that he emailed me the day before and I agreed to a pickup today. Angrily I said, ""I did not agree to this. Your email said nothing about May 9th. Not to mention we signed the contract for May 13th."" ""Well, you have to be on the west coast by the 21st "" (wrong date buddy) ""so we need to ship the car early."" That's bullshit because if you ship it this early I won't be there to pick it up. 

I then ask him to look at the email he sent me. There was a very long pause and he couldn't find the email. He said he is on his phone so he has to wait until he is at a computer. I told him that I am flexible but a few hours notice is not enough time for me and he needs to send a driver who can accommodate the date I agreed to.

After the call I follow up with an email to both the broker and the dispatcher. Dispatcher just confirmed that the driver can't do it after today. Haven't heard anything from the broker yet.

Should I just cancel? Is this typical of a car shipment company? Why would the broker think it is OK to book me 4 days before the agreed contract date when we agreed on May 13th and I paid an extra fee for this date? I am fed up and just want to book with another company. But I paid $125 for this incompetent broker and might lose my deposit. Contract says I lose the deposit after driver has been dispatched.

These events can be small, meaningless events from my past, or even terrible crimes that have taken place in a different time period or place that I had no control over whatsoever. I can't stop feeling like I should have been there to save others, despite knowing that it would never be possible to. I know that even if I could, it'd still be impossible to save everyone in the world.

Of course, this worry has escalated into terribly vivid dreams that absolutely wreck my morning, however, I'll be completely fine the moment I force myself out of bed, but otherwise, I'm stuck in a fear-wridden, shaking mess. I lose the ability to breathe and there's sweat everywhere. I don't even have any recollection of the dreams, all I know is that when I wake up, I feel immense dread (with or without a prior dream). Then immediately after I'm out of bed, I'm able to reason my mind into accepting that some things are just always beyond our control and calm down.

Rather than a sexual one where I feel really weird and uncomfortable- please see if this is appropriate and not too rude.

Hi, your cute and nice but I feel really uncomfortable in this ‘romantic relationship’. I find you funny when you say sexual stuff but when it’s personal to me I find it really uncomfortable and I’m 14 it feels weird and I don’t think I’m ready for that. 

I really liked when we were friends and had banter but now it’s getting creepy, it’s not that your creepy it’s just I don’t feel comfortable it’s too sexual, someone whose more mature and older may be okay with your more personal humour but I find it uncomfortable.

But I really enjoy spending time with you. If you don’t want to be friends I understand but if you do that’s great and I understand it will probably be awkward but I see you as my best friend not my boyfriend. I’m fine with the kinky neko shit jokes. But I won’t send you nudes and I’ll never do anything physical with you and I feel like I have to or that’s where it’s going.

I love hanging out with you but I feel embarrassed and uncomfortable at the moment.

I’m sorry. I honestly feel sick writing this because I really enjoy spending time with you but I think it can go to far sometimes .

I was awaiting my job assignment and expecting to get a few weeks notice, but I got only a couple days. I had to get all of my things down to Texas from Illinois as soon as possible. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but throw in the fact that I just graduated college and don't have significant funds. I only need to make it two weeks before my salary and relocation benefits kick in, but after just getting charged 1000 dollars instead of 400 (because I rented a car at age 24) I am kind of sweating it.  

So now that you have a general idea of my situation I can tell you what I actually need advice on. 

I have a car rented for 2 weeks, and I have a hotel until tomorrow. My priority should be finding an apartment, but I also don't want to have to rent a car for another 1,000 dollars two weeks from now. When my benefits and first paycheck come in it should be in the range of $3500. Then I will make 1,250 every following week. This isn't to hype up myself or anything; I am just seeking honest budgeting advice. 

Should I rent another car so I can save up a little bit for a big down payment on a new car? even though 500/week seems insane for the rental. I could just pay a high monthly fee at first on a car loan until a few paychecks roll in, but I'm entirely new to financing a car. 

How long do you think it will take to find an apartment? I am looking at a place tomorrow and have all intentions of leasing it right then and there if the owner lets me. 

My credit is in the mid 700's, 
I have roughly 1000 dollars, but if I don't lease somewhere by tomorrow that will be cut down to 500 dollars or more for a week stay at a hotel. This is my first post on reddit, so forgive me for being disorganized/all over the place. Any advice is very appreciated."

What broke the camels back for me was once I was out pretty late working on a school project and I came home to the whole place hotboxed. It stunk like weed I was furious because my dad was visiting the next day and she never talked to me about she just did it. Also it’s illegal in my state and i like to follow the rules. She bought me burger So i forgave her. But she kind of kept vaping weed indoors after which I then told her two more times to stop. That just made me lose trust in her. Also it sucks that I’m a little ocd of cleaning but I could get around it. Until she had left dishes in the sink for a month (she did get better at this I’ll give her credit)and the sink began to rust. She also had pizza boxes she left out for two months. She wouldn’t lock the front door and she doesn’t really help with the cleaning, mopping etc. Also she has this guy she started hooking up (they’ve kept me up late a couple of times) but the guy started to stay over a lot and I really don’t like that.

Two weeks ago he would be here from around school ended and left at 5 to 6 in the morning (also I don’t want to pay for another person to be staying here and another problem I have with this guy is I don’t trust him at all he’s bragged about stealing and doing drugs and I don’t feel comfortable about having a guy like that at my place I’ve lost sleep because of this as well) I talked to her again yesterday (I did something pretty shitty I started acting kind of petty towards her. My brothers visited for a day on Saturday and I didn’t tell her about it. Also I was ignoring her because when I get really mad at someone I like to really think about what I want to say and I didn’t want to say something I would later regret) I talked to her yesterday and I said my concerns and apologized for acting shitty towards her it’s probably not very mature of me. She did say that she felt I was overreacting and that she has a life. I then told her that I wanted to move out. ( I can’t move out unless it’s a mutual thing between everyone) but she said no because she couldn’t afford living here, which I said I understood that that’s why I won’t move out unless I helped her find another roommate.

Me ( M ) and bob ( M ) have been seeing each other for about 2.5 years. We aren’t in a “official” relationship but we basically are a thing. Our relationship has always been a bit awkward cause I wanted to see other guys and still see him but he was very much against this. Because of this, we have never really committed but I have also respected his want of me not talking to other guys. 

I can’t beat around the bush. I’m going to cut the sugar coating and state mainly facts. Bob was feeling sick the other day and went to the hospital. Gets checked out, they diagnose him as having a fever. Doctor calls 3 days later, says we need a retesting tomorrow as he showed up positive on a test for HIV. we went through the whole notion that you would expect.

The only people he has had contact with sexually in his life was me his ex and a newer person....someone that I discovered raped him. When I talked to him about seeing other guys he was against the idea. But for some reason, he wanted to try it apparently. He went to his house for a movie, the guy tried to make a move on him, my friend bob said “no” and tried pulling away, but he forced himself on him. My friend being smaller in size and not the strongest, just braced through it all. This happened about 2 months ago. He raped him without a condom.

As you can imagine I’m furious. I spent all day trying to track him down. I stopped my car on the side of the road because I needed fresh air cause all I could think about was ripping his balls off and shoving them down his throat. This guy is one possibility for HIV.

Another possibility is me.... we used protection the first 1.5 years but then we started not using it. I fell for the temptation. I’ve tested negative twice in the past year and negative 5 times in my whole life. I’m getting retested, I know this doesn’t guarantee me out of the picture, but I feel that I am the least likely to be the carrier.

Last but not least: his ex. Always used protection according to him, but his ex has always been a total tool. Stalking him at work, using burner numbers to send sexual messages, total fuckboy... last time my friend truly got tested was a month or 2 after they last screwed, and he came back negative. That was in January of 2015.

I might have HIV, my friend might have HIV, there’s a rapist I’m determined to shut down, and an ex who is total trash and needs a
Restraining order. This wasn’t my battle, but it is now. If bob won’t fight for himself, someone needs to. 

I’m sorry if this post makes no sense. As you can imagine, my emotions have taken over. Please help."
38732,7lv6j5,ipretend2suck,"I'm a Dishwasher at Denny's, saw that my manager replaced the soap I use with glass cleaner, what can I do?","So when I was getting to work the other day, I saw that bottle of chemicals being used for the sinks, usually where the soap would be, was Glass cleaner, a big no no. I asked my manager about it and he said something along the lines of ""That's all we have now, and that's what we're gonna use.""



What can I do? this manager never orders the right amount of chemicals and often puts the wrong thing in the wrong place instead of hitting up another Denny's store for some, something I think he's supposed to do. (I've heard he replaced the chemicals for the dishwasher machine with Utensil pre-soak before) I now only order food in to-go trays and only use plastic utensils.



I'll try to take a picture of the glass cleaner being used when I clock in today. Pretty funny how this manager made me do this computer tutorial for my job when he breaks most of the rules himself. He's done it before and I think he'll keep doing it seeing as how our General Manager left for a better job and this guy is able to run the store how he wants to unchecked.

Please help, I plan on leaving this job soon, but this guy makes the job hell for those people working there who can't get another job.

11860,c4dr1u,rosieblaze,How to encourage my husband to cut down on drinking.,"Hey y'all.

The title pretty much explains itself. And I want to start by saying (admitting really) that I have always been a part of the problem. But how do I transition into a part of the solution? 

My husband and I have been together for 7 years now with a beautiful 5 year old son. We have always been social drinkers with the occasional beer or two after work but the last 2 years have been a little different. We have gone from the initial casual drinking to killing a handle of vodka between the two of us in 2 days. For myself, I grew up with extremely addictive parents who always used substances and 2 months ago started seeing them in myself and quit drinking. 

I've been feeling amazing and happy and more available to my son. My husband on the other hand has almost began drinking more. Hes always agitated and has a SHORT fuse with our son when he drinks. I feel unworthy of preaching limitations when I'm new to it myself but really need to get across the severity of how his excessive drinking affects our family.

I just want us all to be happy. And I know how we are currently functioning is NOT the way. Like I said I've always been a part of the problem but now I need to know how to help my family. Any constructive advice welcomed.

3233,dcv3qi,NothingToSeeHereBruv,How can I approach this girl I really like?,"  Ok, I think it'd be nice to give y'all some context to work on, so please bear with me.

  I'm a high schooler (senior) and I've never been too good at all things socializing, specially when it comes to girls I like. I've never been diagnosed with social anxiety or anything, I just don't do well on social occasions. I absolutely do not fit my school's ""weird kid"" or ""quiet kid"" stereotype (either skinny or fat, likes anime and spends most of their free time playing videogames), I'm actually quite the opposite: 6'5, relatively muscular, I'd say average looking, don't watch anime, I do enjoy videogames, but only on weekends. However, I was still a ""quiet kid"" throughout HS, never went partying too often like most of my buddies, never did too well with girls (even when THEY approached me) and I feel like I've wasted the last 4 years of my life doing nothing but studying and staying home with the occasional varsity basketball, I didn't even have my first kiss, I mean even some of the ""weird kids"" had theirs.

  So, last week I took part in a school event and was in charge of a stand alongside the girl in question, our only job was to serve food to the guests and we ran out of it about halfway through the event so we ""closed up shop"" and talked for the rest of the event. We were aware of each other's existence since before that day, but never really talked. We found out that we share a lot of similarities and we have similar problems and anguishes. For instance, she's terrified of telling her parents she wants to be an engineer because they want her to be an attorney, and I'm terrified of telling my parents that I want to work in law enforcement because they want me to be a MD. I think we really clicked that day. We talked for a bit over text after the event, but neither one of us followed up on the conversation.

It's been a week since that and I'd really appreciate some advice on how to approach her and start a conversation, I have no idea how I could possibly do that without making it weird or out the blue because that's what I've had happen in past social interactions. I'm really nervous about it and it's starting to eat me up inside because it's the first time I've even thought about going forward with something like this, but I know I have to because she's the first person I've ever spent an ENTIRE week thinking about. 

Thank you in advance. :)"

17475,bcn57f,satchel1300,How can someone like me when I’m a cripple?,"3 months ago I ended a potential relationship, and I still haven’t fully processed it. I can’t decide if it was because I can’t trust that somebody could like me because I’m a cripple that doesn’t contribute to society or because I just didn’t like her that much, or maybe because I just didn’t have enough to like her that much. Ok, so some backstory. Around Christmas I met this girl on tinder and we texted back and forth every day for over two weeks. She was completely accepting of my FA and that was great. Here’s where it gets dicy. She would constantly say things like “your so wonderful” and “I love talking to you” and “I get excited every time you text me”... I couldn’t bring myself to say anything but “me too”, and that’s where I really screwed up because I didn’t feel that, and I couldn’t understand how she did. I made it about my FA in that nobody could like me because I’m a burden. Now I’m left wondering if I’m going to end at that point with every potential partner. For the longest time I dismissed it as her getting attached too quickly, but now I don’t know. What do you guys think?

14678,bqsebv,StormieTheCloud,I desperately want male attention.,"Im 20F and I absolutely love men. Just how they look and man I like dudes. Unfortunately I’m not the greatest looking female out there but I do have a boyfriend who I love and cherish very much and he gives me the same but I always find myself striving to maybe put on a little mascara when I know I’ll be working that above attractive coworker or I’ll get stupid subconscious about the smallest things like I want to impress them. It’s gotten to the point where I do it subconsciously now. If a guy is any kind of friendly with me and is mildly attractive I attach on like a leech and fantasize endlessly. (I would never pursue these fantasies. My boyfriend is the best thing that has ever happened to me. The big kicker is that we are long distance and have now for about a year. I just feel like shit for constantly being a little hoe in my head. I didn’t sleep around before I met him and we got together right when we both started college)

It’s so fucked to say but I’m jealous of my sister for getting cat called more. We get a ton of comments saying how we look like twins yet I’ve maybe gotten cat called 3 times in my life while it is a daily occurrence for her.

18086,b98nxo,theincourup,My downstairs neighbor in my apartment is hypocritical in terms of loudness and I'm not sure what to do.,"It started when my wife and I first moved in a couple months ago. Day one, he came upstairs and asked for us to be quiet, that he works early, and to just keep the noise down. We said to him that we have a cat and at most, I play video games and that's all the noise we make.

Nearly daily for a month afterward, he would blast the same couple Taylor Swift songs (often repeating the same song up to 5 times), sing along (badly and loudly enough to hear him), and loudly complain about his day to likely a roommate or boyfriend (and the main reason we know it's a boyfriend is that we could hear the moaning of both of them).

Now, a couple weeks ago, he has complained to us that our cat makes too much noise in the morning for him. Our cat is a 10 pound sweetheart who does get playful in the morning because all cats are playful during hunting time, but can't possibly make more noise over traffic outside or especially the music we dealt with from him. 

My wife is a teacher who has to get up earlier than he said he does and one day he sends her a recording of her footsteps being too loud (which in the video is practically inaudible due to the guy's own footsteps and noise)

I'm asking for advice in dealing with this guy. My family and I can be, and often are, quiet people. But I can't accept being afraid of making a sound in my own home because of this guy

37646,7p6fbs,throwaway379753,Is it wrong for me to be annoyed that my friend invited her boyfriend to a holiday we were planning?,"So we've been planning this trip together for a while now. It was just gonna be us, 10 days overseas, sightseeing, catching live music, cool stuff like that.

Tonight we were texting about it and she tells me she's invited her boyfriend and he's keen to come along. Now her boyfriend's a cool guy and I like him, but I feel like it's not fair of her to spring that on me without asking me if I would be okay with it. If he comes on this trip with us, the trip would definitely be about them and I'd just kind of... be there. We'd also be sharing accomodation and I'd feel awkward about that. I know it would take a lot of the enjoyment out of the holiday for me.

Is it selfish for me to feel this way? I've been really looking forward to this trip because I haven't had a vacation for a long time, now I'm considering not going if it means I'll just be there as a third wheel."

27841,8pyowv,JonnyBr4vo,I'm 21 and I'm completely lost in life,"This is my first post here on Reddit and I'm just looking to get some kind of advice on what to do next in life. I'm still living at home with my mom, I was taking classes at a community college but after a year of that I decided that college really isn't for me, school in general really isn't. I never really struggled to get good grades in high school, I graduated with a 2.8 GPA. My problem is I never study for tests and I procrastinate on all assignments. I also really struggled to pay attention in class which made learning difficult for me. 

Anyways, I'm working a retail job at a Nike store. I've been working there for exactly 2 years now and make around $10.00 an hour. I have open availability and usually pull about 30-40 hours a week. When I'm not at work I'm usually just laying around in my room at home. I do go to the gym and workout for about an hour, 4-5 days a week. But other than that the only time I leave the house is to go to work or to get food. My best friend that I did everything with moved away to South Carolina this time last year and since then I haven't had any kind of social life. I get on and play video games with him all the time but don't really talk with anyone else or hangout with anyone. 

One thing I know about my myself is that I have a really strong work ethic. I'd say that's one of my best qualites. I acquired this trait back in high school when I was playing football. I was a small kid and I wasn't very strong or athelitc. I wanted so badly to be a starter on the varsity team and play on Friday nights. It was a long process and it took me all the way up until my junior year to get a starting spot on special teams, and then my senior year I started on defense and special teams. Anyways, I faced a lot of adversity through that time but I always stuck with it and reached my ultimate goal. I love setting goals and working hard towards them. My problem now is this, I have no passion for anything anymore. 

About 2 years ago I started to get into making YouTube videos and streaming on Twitch. This goal was similar to my football one. I wanted so badly to be a big YouTuber and streamer and I worked my ass off to get there. I uploaded videos daily while I was taking college classes and working a job on the side. After 2 years I had reached 1,000 subscribers and just over 50,000 total video views. It was time for me to move on at that point. I lost the passion for it and felt that my growth wasn't there anymore. Now I'm just stuck and don't know where to go from here. 

If anyone is in a similar situation or has any advice for me on what kind of move I can make next, anything is greatly appreciated. I want to get out of my mom's house and move out on my own. I just don't know how to go about doing it. "

3187,dd0zja,Memelordjuli,I have literally no idea what I want to do as a career,"hi, im 18 years old and i just dropped out of college. i was going to a very good tech college as an IT major. first week of classes, and i realize that i have absolutely zero interest in any of the material. my most interesting class was my earth science class, nothing to do with IT. 

since i was little i always just kind of accepted that i wanted to work with computers. i bounced around between a few different things in computing, programming, video game design, etc. but i always knew that i generally wanted to work with computers. around my junior year of high school i decided i was going to be an IT major with a cybersecurity concentration. i was super pumped for college.

it was the strangest thing to me that after classes started i just lost all interest in computing. i went from 100 to 0 in the matter of days. i tried to force myself to become interested again, but i just cant. 

i feel totally lost because that was what i had my mind set on for my entire life. i barely even gave myself room to think about anything else as a career.

i have a bunch of other interests, but i cant see myself doing any of them as a career. i was thinking film or video editing, but i tried starting up a youtube channel to see if i could see myself doing it as a career, and i got bored with it after the first few videos. i like a bunch of different art things too, but im not talented enough to make it into a career that i can support myself on, and im not motivated or creative enough anyway. i also have an interest in architecture/interior design, but again, cant see myself doing it 40 hours a week/as a career.

im going to my community college in the spring to get an associates, but i have no idea what i want to declare my major as. since i already have a lot of the ""gen ed"" stuff out of the way (took college level courses in high school), theres not much else i can take that isnt directly related to a specific major. 

ive been trying to use my ""gap semester"" as im calling it to figure out what i want to do, but ive done next to nothing. most days consist of me playing video games all day. ive been applying for jobs, but only got a call back from a grocery store. money and something to do is good of course, but i dont consider shoprite a lifelong career. 

my question is, how the hell do i figure out what i want to do? career tests have lead me nowhere. my imposter syndrome is so bad that i cant see myself finding a career where i can be successful, since there are tons of other people who do it better than i do."
35000,7xy3hn,verysleepy24,Need a major change in my life. Been through the same 16 scenarios over and over. What do I do?,"I am a 23 year old female. I was living in a medium city for four years after high school. I was going to community college when my parents just stopped paying in the middle of the semester, so I dropped all my classes. I have intended to go back since then, but I never got around to it. 

I had to split my life between my extremely small hometown and city life after my mom died to help my dad with the family business. That lasted about a year or so until I finally moved home to my small town for good. Now, I am in a year long lease with an online job in a town where I hide from almost everyone I know. 

In the year back and forth, I moved in with my boyfriend at the time. I stayed with him for too long. He was abusive and manipulative. In the wake of that break up, I slept with my neighbor, an old high school classmate, and a best friend I was in love with for years and years. The best friend from high school had me completely convinced we were in love, that his current girlfriend was an open relationship, she knew all about me and our feelings for each other and we would miss our chance forever if we weren't together immediately. I knew he had a baby on the way. Not from his current girlfriend either. I found out his new girl was also pregnant on facebook. AND I STILL SLEPT WITH HIM. It ended in flames, and I was completely heartbroken. I still feel heart broken. I think in my head i blamed all my problems since then on him, but I put myself in the fucking terrible situation. I never thought i would be this type of girl. I never thought I could make such destructive decisions. It's not just the heart break or moving home. I am in a deep fucking hole and I don't know what I want or need to do to change it. I tried lists, goal plans, planners. Nothing works. Nothing even matters here to me anymore. The only reason I haven't run away yet is my three year old nephew. I have a plan for my education. Well, at least I know what I want to do. But, the thought of living here and commuting to the closest school an hour away is terrible. I think the last time I felt happy was when I was 16 and kissed a boy on the football field. I am aware of how pathetic that is. I don't know where to go from here.

 I am planning on moving far away where I don't know anyone and starting over. Probably Seattle. I don't honestly expect anyone to read this. If anyone has bored themselves to death listening to me complain, any input would be amazing. "
37937,7o772q,leathercanid,I'm having trouble interpreting signals from girls at my school please help.[18 male],"I honestly don't know much about what makes girls happy because I've never had a girlfriend in my entire life and they have always avoided me when I tried to talk to them. I've ended up in some sort of awkward thing with tow different girls who I will refer to as ""Miss E"" and ""Miss K"" because I was raised a gentleman and I don't think it would be appropriate to put their names on the Internet.(don't worry I use their real names in real life)

As I said there never really were any girls who were into me. There was one freshman Miss E though who seemed different. She was gorgeous and she laughed when I told jokes and she smiled whenever she saw me in the hallway. I ate lunch with her for about a month and we seemed to be getting along fine. She even called me handsome. I asked her to the Halloween dance but she said she didn't have a costume and I didn't think she was lying to me. A few days later I asked if she would like to go to a movie with me and a few friends she said she was busy. At that point I began to suspect she wasn't into me. A day later my suspicions were seemingly confirmed when she said that she  ""didn't know how she felt about me and to give her time to think"" she also basically told me to stop eating lunch with her. I came back a week later and I asked how she felt. Miss E literally *cringed* in front of me and said it was all too fast. 

After that I was really fucking depressed. I had to go to consoling through my school every Monday. I didn't even feel like doing anything anymore and nothing seemed fun. Talking to my councilor helped a lot and she motivated me to get fit and to improve my hygiene. I changed my hairstyle I started exercising daily and started worrying about my looks. Even after all of that Miss E was still trying to avoid me. And she never said a word if I said hi to her in the hallway. 

I gave up and started talking with her friend Miss K. Miss K isn't as pretty but she's still cute and she is smart and she seems to enjoy being around me. When my school went to Starbucks(it's small enough for the entire high school to go their at once actually). I got her some hot chocolate with my own money. That made her smile. She said she really appreciated it or something like that. 

I didn't see Miss K again until after winter break was over. Yesterday when I got back from school I didn't get to talk to her because Miss E is her best friend and it would feel weird to talk to both of them. Today Miss E seemed to be looking at me differently. She smiles whenever I pass her by in the hallway even though she doesn't say anything. After school she saw me staring looked at me and grinned saying ""don't do anything weird.""

I honestly don't know if either of them are into me and I don't know how to talk to them if they are. Or which one to talk to. That's where you come in I guess?

Note: If you're wondering why I'm going after freshman it is because my school is a tiny special ed school and both of the senior girls have boyfriends. Same thing with the Juniors and Sophomores.

Edit: my mom said I shouldn't assume miss E is into me and she might be making fun of me."

Hi fellow redditors. I’ve decided to reach out to you all because I figure strangers are likely to be the most honest. 

Here’s my situation: I’m 30 years old and I’m in law school. Just finishing up my first year. I’m part-time, so it will take me another 3 years to graduate. I work part-time at a firm and take home about $200 a week after taxes, but it isn’t enough to afford my life as I find myself constantly strapped for cash. My student loans are about $20k per year. The rest of my tuition is covered by a scholarship, and I pay about 3k out of pocket each semester. My scholarship is merit-based, so I need to place in the top 50% of the class to keep the full amount. Without it, I don’t think I could afford school. 
I went to undergrad for teaching—taught at a high school for a year right out of college and HATED IT. So I started working various office jobs for shitty pay, going up ever so slightly at each new job. A couple of years ago I decided I wanted to go back to school to become a dietitian, because I love food and nutrition and educating others about these things. It would have taken about 5 years because of all the science pre-reqs i hadn’t taken in undergrad. I got pregnant towards the end of the first semester and had to withdraw because I was sick and had had a miscarriage. The school had given me a scholarship but didn’t tell me till late in the semester that I was one credit short of full-time, and so my scholarship couldn’t be applied and that I now owed them 6k (which I’ve since paid off). Went back to working office jobs, my highest salary to date being 45k. Decided to take the plunge and try law school (as I had been working at law firms at gained an interest) but I now hate it. I am constantly stressed out, broke, and my job prospects after graduation don’t seem like they’ll get me very much more based on what I’ve been told by other attorneys i work with/have worked with. If i drop out of school again I will feel like a complete and total failure in the eyes of everyone I know. If i stay, I will graduate and have an 80k mountain of debt and a degree in a field I no longer find myself passionate about or wanting to work in. I can’t go back into teaching because my certification expired. I don’t know what else to do except give up and accept the fact that I will never earn a salary over 45-50k in my lifetime. Help?"

Okay. So my friend is 15 years old. And at the time of the first one back April 2018. And as I've recently found out. Has lasted all the way up until now. This other guy is a close friend of hers and she still wants to hangout with him. Her brother is sometimes there with the 2 of them. But when he leaves. He ends up assaulting her. Im sot sure what to do.

We live in Canada

My question is if i got a few people together to help me, could we report him? My friend has mentioned before that she would deny it if we reported this. We don't know what the backmail is. But im sure if his phone was searched they would find it

And I just can’t stop thinking about it. I’m only 15 and I’m so terrified of the thought that I won’t live until I’m old. I want to die of my old age one time and not die because some companies like to pollute the earth and go over human lives (even their own!!!!!) just to make money... 
im only 15 and I can’t really do anything. All I’m doing right now is to recycle, picking up trash when I find something or saving up water. I'm just so terrified and afraid of it.

I’ve never been into trouble before I’m a straight A student (probably doesn’t matter but school makes you believe it is) but I feel like a fucking child now and man is she going to be really mad at me and probably there will be rumors about me at school now.

6620,cuhqes,bismarckdick,Should I get my girlfriend's drug dealer busted?,"So I've been together with her for about a year now. I truly love her and we are happy together. 
About six months ago, however, she started smoking weed with some of our mutual female friends. That's not a problem for me, as long as she's happy. Now here's the problem:

Her dealer doesn't only sell weed but all kinds of drugs. Literally all of them. The past month, her casual smoking has slowly been turning into a real addiction. She craves to smoke it not because of her company but because she needs to. I'm really worried for her and sie won't stop. Like I've told her several times that I'm very concerned for her health and well being, but she shruggs it off and tells me not to worry ""it's under control"". 
It is not. Definitely not. 

The main problem for that is her dealer. He's getting more and more pushy and basically urges her to take hard drugs like LSD or Cocaine. 

That also wouldn't be a problem, but she says, that she's ""curious"" and that she ""wants to try it for fun"". But I know, that once she's tried it once, her dealer will make it cheaper and more attractive for her in order to get her and her friends addicted. 

As you can see, she doesn't appear to know how easy it is to get her addicted and that her dealer isn't ""friendly"" and giving her a ""discount because they are friends"". They're not. He just wants to maximise his profits on her cost. Literally and figuratively.

A while back she told me his name and now I'm in a conflict with myself. 
Neither she nor her friends listen to me. I've literally tried everything to help them. I really don't want to have to go to ne girlfriend's funeral because she overdosed. That's why I wanted to go to the police and give them an anonymous tip on who one of the biggest dealers in town is. Our town is fairly small, so that might cripple the whole drug business here.

Now what do you think? Should I get him busted so he can't sell her drugs anymore? I'm really desperate and his disappearence would make it impossible for her to buy drugs from him. She would never find out that it was me who told the police. 

Thank you very much."
35946,7umh1f,hnjo,I don't really have friends anymore. Sometimes I feel like an eleven year old in eleventh grade.,"I am 17 years old but most people think I am maybe somewhere around 11. When I was with my younger sister, she was talking about going in to tenth grade with a person who worked at a store, she said ""aww is this your sister what grade is she going in to"". She said eleventh grade and for half a second the person didn't believe her. Then she said ohh and started laughing for a few seconds, then there was a few seconds of oops I shouldn't be laughing. People automatically think that I am not in high school and say ""when you get to high school there will be this"" and then they get so surprised when I say I am in eleventh grade. I did this activity thing last summer with fourth fith and sixth graders and they thought I was about their age. I think I sometimes exaggerate how big of a deal this is. Its not like an incredibly big difference or anything. But at the same time sometimes I feel like I am not relatable with people my same age. Not the way I look but the way I act. People in my same grade are talking about getting jobs, driving cars, some are even buying houses. I am just not as interested in becoming friends with most my age as I used to be. Even with kids I used to be friends with years ago. I can have a fun conversation about a certain tv show one moment and then the subject changes to something weird and I dont have anything to say. There are some people at school who I talk to a little bit for a few seconds each day but other then that I dont really have friends."
11752,c51mbw,Sparabic17,I'm traveling to New York for two days (family vacation) and I'm TERRIFIED.,"I live in a small suburb in Tennessee near Memphis, and big cities scare the living fuck out of me. ESPECIALLY when going with my family.  Going on vacation with my family is always a challenge because there's so many of us (8 people in total including me) and there's always some big argument, if not continuing tension that stresses me the hell out.  Usually if there's some sort of argument or tense situation that has nothing to do with me, I leave. Because fighting makes me anxious and I'd rather not have a panic attack in front of people. But when I'm in a big van with all of family members? There's NO ESCAPE. I love my family, and they love me. But most of the time, no one knows how to calm down. It's usually sparked with just two people arguing about literally nothing, or arguing about something that really should be saved for when we're separated. And to make it all worse, my dad insists on all of us being together when it's just not realistic. One time we went to a shopping mall in Dallas, Texas. And my dad was sure strict on the ""stick together, we're family"" thing that we all just ended up playing ""follow the leader"" and basically doing nothing but walking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate hate hate any kind of attention being brought towards myself, especially if it's in a negative context. i.e. People staring at my family raises their voices. So imagine us being in New York? I reaaally don't want us to be seen as THAT crazy family. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like an thankful twat but this is really how I feel about this. Also, couple this in with the negative stereotypes of New York drilled into my head by my peers from living in the south. The stereotypes go: people are rude, trying to scam you, tourist traps ect.  And this is not helped by the fact that my dad and brother are EXTREMELY confrontational people.

20862,aue4w4,livefree62,Have recently taken a social media hiatus for mental health reasons and now feeling strangely lonely. How can I combat this?,"I mean, I’m always lonely to some degree because I’m single. But ever since getting off social media, the loneliness has been substantial.

I decided last week that I was going to take a break from social media (Instagram and Facebook). I’m 24 years old and I was (and am) feeling very upset and unhappy with my life for no specific reason. I realized I spent over two hours a day looking at Instagram. And that wasn’t ok.

I’m an engineer. I make a 6 figure salary. I’ve traveled to over a dozen countries. I have an average body figure (not overweight, not supermodel skinny). I have friends. I play the piano.

And all of these things are supposed to make me happy with my life, right? .. wrong. I go on social media and I see my friends and strangers who are more successful than me. Getting married, having babies, traveling the world. And then I see celebrities who are living life in luxury with perfect bodies. And then I see piano players far better than I ever will be.

Teddy Roosevelt  said “Comparison is the thief of joy”. And that is so true. But as a human being  it’s hard not to compare. And the whole concept of social media, people constantly flaunting their every achievement and material gain, makes it harder.

So I decided to delete all of the apps. But now I feel lonely. It’s like there were 1000 people watching my every day life and now there are zero. And sometimes men would message me complimenting my pictures and it was a nice ego boost. Even though this did bother me, because I’d get a heart eye emoji instead of a compliment using one of the many words in our English vocabulary. Which made me feel like courting was now lazy and genetic.

Anyway, how can I combat this feeling of being alone? I don’t want to go back to social media. I want to be present and life my own life and not see everyone else’s every second of every day."
11528,c659z5,_Ghatotkach_,I'm not comfortable in my own skin anymore,"Okay before you guys jump on me for hating myself and tell me to start loving myself just the way I am, hear me out, please.

So I'm 18 and I have 2 problems,

Part 1-I have growth of hair on my ears (on the edge of it) I'm facing this since 8th grade back then it wasn't visible as much as it is today, it was very soft and barely noticeable. Some guy pointed it out once which made me conscious (I wouldn't say I was buried for it but I did feel like I had to do something about it). My mom tried some home remedies and used to occasionally pluck them out using tweezers so it wasn't much of a deal, it used to long long enough like I could go hair free for weeks. Then, one day, to save time my mom trimmed the hair, and then ever since then the duration started decreasing. I switched to depilatory creams which used to do wonders initially, the effect lasted for a week easily, fast forward to today, my ears have become dark in the regions where I applied depilatory creams, the hair is thicker and darker than ever, depilatory creams don't give a smooth finish anymore. I've told them a lot of times to allow me to get this roved for good using laser but they are really dodgey they're like , umm okay tell us the clinic we'll take you their but then they get dicey like ""what's the harm in still using the cream?"" Or ""shave it"", I don't know ke what to do.

Part 2- I have grade 1 Gynecomastia (I think it's grade 1) I'm not a bulky dude I'd say I'm kinda on the skinny side, so the protrusion of my nipples is even more evident as the rest of my body is not chubby, the nipples are puffy and it is visible when I wear certain clothes (some clothes are able to hide it but some can't). I told my parents about it and they first were in a denial mode, they would giggle and say ""it's nothing, have you seen how severe Gynecomastia can get"". My grandpa is a doctor, he examined me and said it's because of hormonal changes , it might or MIGHT NOT go away with time. Whenever I bring up the topic of what to do with this my parents and even my grandpa says ""focus on studies, focus on other things"".

My mom recently agreed to fix both these problems but then she said why don't you just buy more Polo shirts (they hide it easily).I can't just always wear polo shirts, can I ? I wanted to redefine my body by working out but this Gynecomastia is coming in my way, I think working out will make the problem worse.

23554,9cg71k,notmybffthrowaway,Uncomfortable that one of my friends thinks that I'm her best friend,"I'm an eighteen year old student who's currently in college. Two semesters ago, I met a girl who's in the same major as I am. We were taking the exact same classes, so I started walking with her to/from class. However, I've begun to recently realize how incompatible we are for each other; we have completely different values, personalities, and goals in life. Last semester, she started introducing me to people as her ""best friend EVER"" and has invited me to go to her house multiple times.

​

I'm incredibly uncomfortable with the fact that she thinks I'm her best friend while I secretly don't; I know this sounds really cold, but I've never really felt any special connection with her and don't think I'll bother keeping in contact with her after we graduate. She's already started to plan our ""best friend schedule"" -- she wants us to be in ALL the same lectures next semester.

​

I understand that she's not doing any of this to make me feel uncomfortable, but I don't like this relationship anymore and I want out. However, I don't want to hurt her feelings or make her hate me. Does anyone have any advice?"

16193,bjfyho,Criminalpeacocks,Anxiety while studying,"I was never good at maths so the last couple of years I tried to combat that with forcing myself to pay attention all the time in class (which is hard for me because of ADD) and never missed a class. I got pretty good at it, despite not knowing how to calculate (I also have dyscalculia because apparently god hates me).

I have two weeks until my final exams and I got such strong anxiety because I‘m scared of failing my degree that in an intense nervous breakdown I forgot how to do anything that I learned the past two years. (Basics are still there, but the panic and the ADD makes it hard to remember the exact way to do the exercises.) I‘m getting anxiety every time I try to study again because I can‘t focus on anything.

I‘m thinking about contacting my therapist again, but my family says I‘m overreacting (well of course I am, anxiety does that and this degree is so important to me) so do you guys have any other ideas? Maybe tips on studying effectively? I would be so grateful for any advice!"

12698,c053io,LastaccIswear,How do I get over what my ex-girlfriend did ?,"Last year my ex-girlfriend broke up with me in a really shitty and brutal way which left me in a state of resenment towards her. Her behaviour was disgusting and I actually felt good after she broke up, because (my immature) me knew that she will heavily regret this decision and looked forward to this realisation of hers.

But after 2 months and after my anger was gone I noticed that something was off. Her behaviour just didn't seem to really make sense. I knew her for 5 years and she just wasn't the type of person that would do such things. She also had a history of multiple mental health issues. After informing myself a little bit I found out that she was most likely bipolar. I also went through conversations of the 5 years we knew each other and there I found a manic episode that lasted for 10 months.

I put two and two together and came to the conclusion that she is undiagnosed bipolar, which means that her behaviour wasn't her fault (people in a manic episode can't control anything, they often commit suicide after the episode is over, because they regret everything they did during the mania so much) and that her episode will end in around 8 months, since 2 months already passed.

So around 9 months after the break up she messaged me. She didn't know why she behaved like this and she felt sorry. I told her about my suspicion, she went to a psychiatrist and she is now diagnosed and is on meds.

She also wants to get back together with me. Here is the thing : During the mania she dated a guy that caused her to break up. When I was still together with her the guy lied to me multiple times and tried to bring my ex-girlfriend to cheat on me. Which she didn't do. But she decided to break up with me and then started dating him. So technially no cheating, but not what you would call nice either.

But on the other side I couldn't find closure at all after the relationship, since I knew that it wasn't her fault and since I knew that she would sooner or later contact me and would regret her decision.

So I love her. And I want to be together with her. But everytime I look at her I have to think of the guy that managed to get her to break up. And I have to think of her falling for such a guy. I also feel sorry however, because she feels disgusted that she even dated such a person and she even cried because of it.

It's a shitty situation. I love her, but I also hate her and I don't know if I can overcome this. Any advice ?"
29438,8h85uu,jamesp_white,Still angry and bitter about the murder of a girl I didn't even know,"About a year ago, a girl who went to my college was raped and murdered not far from the college. She was walking a route I would often walk when I had a free period and my friends were all in lessons.

Obviously, it had had a profound effect on everyone who knew her, but even though I never met her in my life, the fact that I was so close (about a quarter mile) away from the murder makes me feel like I should've been there.

It's completely unreasonable to suggest I had any reason to be there, yet I still feel so frustrated that I didn't choose to go for a walk in the same area she did on that day.

I feel like in the aftermath of her murder, a lot of people at the college pretended they were closer to her than they really were, so I haven't mentioned this to anyone, but even 12 months down the line I can't shake this feeling of guilt for something I had no part in at all.

Any tips?"
19305,b29lie,Dhakaopppq,My neighbor was shot and I lost my sense of invulnerability.,"My neighbor who I never new who was a drug dealer was shot on the face yesterday, I only found out because I walked over to see what all the police buzz was about, they came up with nothing, but a week later it was found on video that his mother was talking to person in the car that shot the kid. So it was a setup.


This is where my problem starts. The guy that shot him will probably never be found, and I’m just spiteful and sad about it. How can someone get away with taking another persons life? It’s beyond depressing that poor guy led in the wrong direction will never have his justice done.
I also lost my sense of invincibility. Every cop show I ever watched in the USA has caught the bad guy. Why not now? I’m scared because this happened around me.

It cost me a couple thousand for all the move-in fees and all that fun stuff. Here's where the conflict comes in.

Both of them have their girlfriends over every single day and they sleepover at least five times a week. Both my roommates work the same job so they leave at 7 a.m. in the morning and their girlfriends just stay at the house. YES, you heard that right! They just stay at our house while they are at work! I find it so odd.

I don't have work until 12 p.m. so I am always looking forward to having the house to myself in the morning.

Most mornings I get up around 8:30 or 9am, I'll be walking around in only my boxers playing some music and drinking some coffee. 

The other morning I see one of my roommates girlfriends pop out of his room to get some water. I am in loose boxers with an obvious bulge. It just feels so awkward because I feel like if I pay rent for this house house I want to feel comfortable here. Especially if I know both my roommates are gone at work, I can walk around the house as freely as I please. 

I feel like I have acquired two new female roommates and it's really bothering me. Like the other morning one of the girls was doing dishes at like 9 a.m. while I was trying to sleep in a little bit. It just feels so unnecessary I do not know what to do. If this continues would it be appropriate to bring it up to my roommates? I just feel like it would offend their girlfriends so much they wouldn't want to come back. And that's not what I want I just don't want them to live with me."
18938,b4hjl3,journey2freedom,I keep beating myself up about this - did I make the right decision?,"Few months ago I got through to the final round of my “dream job”. However, I ended up withdrawing from the process due to the below reasons:

- When I applied to the job the team didn’t think I had enough experience even though HR thought I was perfect. I ended up writing a page long email.

- The first and second round of interviews were great. They loved me and I got great feedback across the board. 

- Scheduling the last round of interviews was a nightmare. The big boss just could not commit to a time. We decided for a Wednesday and by Tuesday 6pm the big boss had HR to cancel on me. I was anxious because I was going through my promotion at work. I explained that I wouldn’t be able to do any other dates that week. The big boss agreed to stay with Wednesday. 

- Wednesday the big boss had HR tell me 2 hours before the interview he wouldn’t be able to attend. Wow. This was frustrating because how many fake appointments can you have? I just looked dodgy at work. 

- We settled for a very early morning interview. The big boss showed up 7-8 minutes late. OK. They knew I was there 30 minutes earlier too. 

- The interview was going well for the most part until I asked the big boss about his management style since he said he was hands on. He was offended and made a comment to the degree of “it sounds like you’re interviewing me”. I quickly explained myself. 

- I told him I was working on publishing an industry paper. He said he wanted me to send him my writing examples. I felt so crap because this is the final stage interview so it felt like a step back.

- Decision time, I was supposed to hear back that day but they said they needed time. Please keep in mind that by now the entire final stage had been dragged by a whole month. Come Monday, mid afternoon and they still hadn’t made up their mind. I just couldn’t believe it. HR said they were still reviewing my written work. 

- I ended up withdrawing because something in my gut told me something was off. But some days I feel sad because I really wanted this job but wasn’t prepared to join a team with weird management. 

Does something sound off here? I don’t know if I should reapply (I doubt I would) but I feel sad. I was the candidate of choice until I met the big boss who said he heard great stuff about me but his energy was off. 

Any insight?"

568,dqyukv,ChaosMatcher64,"My parents are thinking of retiring in 3 years, my older brother is a college drop out, a younger brother is in ninth grade, and me in my first senior high year. What can I do?","Here's a wall of text of background info

We're not poor, just to get that out of the way. We're just as average as any other family. But I'm kinda worried our money may slowly dwindle as the years go by. 

 I'm a 17 year old, self-taught artist(I guess?) who is in the middle of my first senior high year. I'm currently studying in ICT as I recall them having a subject about animation but it seems I may get those classes in the second semester as the classes I have know seem to be generalized like junior high.

My parents (around 50 but not mid) have announced to us about a month ago that they are likely to retire after 3 years from now. This shocked me greatly than my two brothers as that meant no one could replace my parents in the working status after their retirement since my brother has just dropped from college and would have likely finished it after my parents retired. I pleaded to them about reconsidering but they seem adamant about it and they said me once that god will find a way for us to succeed which honestly kinda bugs me. 

My older brother, 19 years old, dropped out of college midway during his first year around a year ago so he's been a drop out for at least one and a half year. He goes to a doctor along with my parents for some sort of mental evaluation (idk) and goes to some mental improvement class every tuesdays and thursdays. Other than that, he is always found in front of the computer doing god knows what and fanfiction. He seems to have no interest in going back to school at all.

My younger brother, 15 years old, is in the ninth grade. He is just as as worried as I am about out future but shows his worries lesser than I do. He plans to finish to college and, according to him, usurp our father's position in his workplace. I don't know if that works. He's also hoping that the loyalty fund(is that what you call it?) of my parents from working in the same company for a long time is enough to get him up till college. 

I want to know what I can do from here since I've been stressing this out since two months ago. I honestly believe I shouldn't go to college and proceed to go to work already to save my parents' money and help out with my younger brother's education and even then I have doubts since I don't think my art skills can cut it enough just yet.

My boyfriend is into small, petite girls / Instagram fitness girls. I'm tall and broad, literally the opposite of what he is usually into. He talks about women that look like the opposite of me, and has never actually complimented my body. Whenever I send intimate pictures, he just goes ""nice."". And whenever I show a model that is similar to my body type, he doesn't care for it. Whenever I show a slender girl, he does. I compliment him constantly and show a lot of attraction towards him. I understand that he has a preference, but all my friends have boyfriends who constantly talk about how beautiful they are, and they are so proud of them. I feel like I shouldn't be the way I am, as if I'm taking up too much space, like I am not feminine, attractive and cute, because I'm so broad. I used to not mind the way my body looks, but since I've been with him that confidence slowly went away.  I don't think he realises that he hasn't complimented me / that it makes me so insecure.

So I (21 F)have a group of online friends. There's lots of them but the 'main' group is myself and three others. None of us live close to each other except two do live together in scotland I have a major crush on the other one whom lives in the states. I'm in Canada. 

I thought it would go away since I dont actually ever see him, we have only met in person once, when the four of us met up in Scotland but we do chat on discord and messanger almost every day. I have hoped that he felt the same way and was just too shy to say but at the same time I think that's stupid. If a guy likes you wouldn't he let you know? If someone wants to he with you they'll make it happen right? 

Hes one of my best friends and I just dont think I could tell him how I feel. I love talking to him and we have a lot of fun playing games and bantering back and forth. I cant even go on dates with other guys because he is all I can think about romantically. If he doesn't feel the same way and I tell him I feel that I won't have only ruined our friendship but the entire dynamic of our group. And in the miracle event that he does we live so far away from each other.

I'm just not sure what to do. "

He has told me in the beginning of our relationship that he was involved in two different affairs with married/engaged coworkers during the same time and got caught by one of them. He told me he didn’t feel guilty about it because it wasn’t his relationship he was jeopardizing and that he has never been unfaithful to past girlfriends. I have learned from my past and would never even imagine cheating again. But I’m left wondering if he would. I have no reasons to suspect him of doing so. I feel confident in our relationship but still get scared of all the what-if’s. If he would develop feelings for someone better, more interesting, more compatible... if he would pursue them and enjoys the chase. How do I shake this fear off..."

My step father who has been in my life for 10 years is just NOW trying to actually be a parent? He's always ignored me and if there was a problem just had my mom handle it. My mom has always been free to parent me as she saw fit. But appearantly, she's been doing it wrong this whole time and now he wants to step in. 
My mother and I are very liberal while my step father is very conservative and old fashioned in his thinking, he's also very hypocritical, saying I shouldn't be on the internet so much because of all the vulgarity online, meanwhile he's constantly on his phone (my mother and him get into fights over how much he's on his phone) and is cursing multiple times in every sentence he says. 
My mother has always taken a very guiding approach to parenting and everyone in our family thinks I'm very respectful and well mannered. I don't drink or smoke or do any drugs, I've never snuck out or been in with the wrong crowds. But my step father seems to think that I'm VERY disrespectful and completely out of control and is NOW taking a very VERY controlling approach to parenting which I'm having a hard time handling. I've always been given a voice and been trusted to make my own decisions and to take care of myself, while now I'm having that taken away, right when I should have it the most, as in a couple short years, I will be an adult and be forced to do these things. 

So I have 2 options at the moment. 

Either stay here and go to a school with less than 70 kids in it, when all I want is to blend into the crowd. 
Or I can go live with my biological father and go to a larger school and get a part time job and continue to be largely self governing. 

I'm heavily leaning towards going to live with my father, but I want to see if other people would make the same choice as I don't want to do something I would regret later. "

31475,89zwwn,captainother,I'm undecided,"Hi there,

I'm in a unique situation.

I'll give you my background for some context. I'm 18 years old and have always had an interest in computers. When I was 13 I picked up coding and loved it and did it a lot. This 'ember' for coding went all the way until a few months ago only a few months after I had started my apprenticeship with a somewhat large financial firm as an apprentice software developer. This apprenticeship lasts for two years and aims to train and qualify me to be a software developer (and pay me while doing it, yay :D ). My problem is I've lost this spark and don't find myself programming in my spare time anymore and I've noticed compared to other apprentices and other people my age, I'm just not as good at programming as they are, and I have little motivation to improve. Over the past couple of years I found myself more interested in politics and reading and commenting on that. Even joining a (unnamed for opinions sake) party. I also have GCSEs in English(Lit and lang), Maths, Science, Statistics, Computer Science. Level 3 BTEC Distintion in IT (all Cs D: ) I also have D*D*D* in IT level 4 (best grade possible) and a C in a-level core maths. I've been recently thinking about going to uni after I finish my two years as an apprentice. The money won't be a problem, will it be possible to get into uni with these qualifications and do you think this is a good move for me?

23584,9c9xzm,OutwithaYang,Should I just leave my college instead of just taking a semester off?,"Okay, so I've been studying medicine and taking science courses for five years now but I was never an ace when it came to math and science. I've always been more of an Arts, English, and History girl and I've been said to be pretty intuitive when it comes to those subjects. I only decided to major in Health Science majors because years ago when I was first starting out college and majoring in Political Science, something I actually liked and did well in, I was constantly pushed by my mom to major in health sciences instead and try to become a doctor. Since we could afford for me to continue at my first college, I ended up transferring to a community college. At the time, I had decided to take the required courses needed to major in a Health major. It was either Nursing or Respiratory Care, and I chose Respiratory Care. Managed to survive most of it but failed during my third semester, and I felt burnt out at the time. But I wanted to keep going so I would go into medicine and make my parents proud. I took a year off, and was advised by my mom to take online healthcare courses and get certificate, so I could get a job in healthcare. I tried to do that and managed to finish one course. But I didn't have much money to pay for the certificate and after the stress of the previous semester, and dealing with stuff at work, it took some serious motivation to try to get to the end. I still didn't complete the last few chapters, and my mother practically reminded me almost every day how I ""could have been far"" if I had finished it.This was well into the time I was going back to school, too. I wanted to complete things but I felt like I was at burnt out at the same time. I didn't want to be a complete waste of money and throw away everything I worked hard for, so I majored in Exercise Science at the four year college I was going to. I started off well, taking required courses before moving onto the heavy science courses. But as the year went by, certain courses got harder to balance, even with help from the tutors. By summer of 2017, my mom had finally turned a new leaf after realizing that I wasn't really happy with my major despite my pursuit in it and attempt to get a degree in it. She decided to advise me to change my major if I don't feel comfortable and do art and creative writing, what I was already good at and passionate about. As much as it seemed nice to hear those words, I didn't want to just throw all the years of studying health science away just like that when I was so knee-deep in the major and almost done with it. I also was a little annoyed with the fact that, for years, she had been pushing for me to study medicine and all of a sudden she was okay with me doing art and animation instead. I mean, where was that support when I was first considering going to an art school to study animation or when I was studying political science. She kept hammering the idea of me being a doctor and it felt like she wanted to steer me in that direction because she never got to be a doctor when she was in college studying medicine. So, it felt nice to hear something different, but I didn't want to just shift just because she wanted me to. I kept going, even when things got harder, and I ended up failing again and regretting not giving up sooner and changing my major like she stated the summer before. Now I have been academically suspended, but with some help from advisors I'm getting a chance to complete school, or take time off and take courses outside to transfer back to school. I've decided to do the latter but try to sign up for additional online courses in animation, so I could get a certificate in it.
My mother mentioned the idea and she seemed excited after sending me links to animation school sites and online course site from umass. She wanted me to follow my original dream and be happy. Since choosing to just take a year off and take the animation courses AND community health course online, I've been having doubts. Since telling my mother my choice, she's been more somber in her behavior, like she's mad that I didn't just fully leave and go to an art school. Even though I have a good job now to support myself through school, I'm wondering if I really want to return to school in the spring after years of taking loans, and physically to school. I already told the teacher that I plan to go back in the spring. Should I even go back or should I just thrown it all away, leave the school entirely and go to an online art school. I'm planning on becoming an animator anyway and going into the medical illustration/animation career given my love of art and animation and experience with health studies. But going back means making more payments that I'll have to do out of pocket now (We can't take any more loans because of already owing so much).

Anyone ever been through these problems in college and have some advice. I'm worried I'm going to make the wrong choice again and not graduate like I want.

No pet compares to him, no pet has shown me such affection and comfort. Before I left for college, he was always beside me. He seems to be upset that I keep coming home and then leaving again for weeks at a time. Writing this brings tears to my eyes.

I will more than likely not be there when he passes and I keep urging my family to let me know if they ever think he needs to be put down so that I can get home and be there for him during his final moments. I have cherished him for many years and he has been there for me through all my anxiety, loneliness, and tears.  


I cannot remember a time before him and thinking there is a time without him in the future is devastating. I don't know how to handle all of this. I only get to go home once a month.  


He's 14, and is experiencing minor kidney failure. I can tell he is deteriorating. He sleeps more, drinks more water, needs more help getting on furniture, and cuddles with us more. Overall he is in good spirits, and I can't wait to see him in 7 days.

29290,8i2kaa,EmergencyFerret,How do I negotiate a raise?,"I have been in a temp position since Mid-January of this year, and I've found out in the last few days that I am being offered a full time position with the company. For the record it was a temp-to-hire position, so I've just been waiting for my ninety days (plus processing) to be up. 

Only my coworkers that were hired on in the same training class as me have been consistently receiving their offer letters with a pay decrease. Technically its not substantial, but from 11.91 to 11.00 is going to be roughly $40.00 less a week. Potentially a lot more depending on how much the benefit opt-in is. 

This is a good company to work for, and its in the HIM field so its fairly stable. The problem is that I live in a city experiencing a housing shortage, and while the average pay is pretty high (cashiers at fast food usually start at $10.00 full-time) the cost of living is higher. 

So I would like to see if its possible to negotiate my ""offer"", but  I'm not really sure how to do so. Especially since this is probably the first job I've had that hasn't involved retail work, and I've never been in this sort of position.

However, I did an extremely high dosage (3 tabs, 600ug) and came home really incompetent and sick to my stomach. Long story short, I ended up in the hospital after the ER and my mom called my good friend but he wouldn't really fess up but he was scared and doesn't have a good track record with moms. He drove me home and dropped me off but my mom thinks he had left me and I beg to differ since I know he did what he thought was best at the time. My other friend is moving up north so it doesn't matter to me that much but I hang out with the other two quite often and they've done nothing but help me whether it'd be relationship advice or any advice in general. Due to this ""LSD Overdose"" I am now gonna have to get a job to pay for my phone bill, no longer have a car and I am supposed to cut ties with these 3 friends of mine. I also lied to her about him not taking 3 tabs so she wouldn't rant about how he drove 3 people who were impaired while he was also impaired behind the wheel. My mom is a great mom but she has certain restrictions and I feel shackled sometimes so she suggested we go to therapy since our relationship is pretty much in shambles from this horrible experience. I feel remorseful and am going to try my best to make this go away but the thought of not being able to hang out with three of my close buddies because of a shitty situation that in my opinion, wasn't really their fault is ludicrous. She has a notion of that they're drug addicts and they're scumbags but they're really not and I don't want to hurt her anymore then I already have.

I also read that spotting can be caused because of stress, and I’ve been stressing about being pregnant a lot. If I am pregnant, I want to terminate the pregnancy, i’m simply not ready for a child. I cannot tell my parents about this, and I’m really scared. "

But for some reason, my mom is forcing me to play sports even though I don't want to. I think part of the reason is jealousy. She is very competitive with all of her friends and its always who's son is the best. One time, my mom went to her friends house, and she saw her son playing the piano. After the visit, she went back home and yelled at me for not playing instruments because it will not get me accepted into college, wtf? SO SHE BOUGHT A FUCKING PIANO, AND I DON'T EVEN USE IT TO THIS DAY. It's like she expected me to want to play the piano. About sports, she signed me up for basketball without me knowing to try to sneak me in or something. I know how to play basketball, but i don't like or show I like it at all. It's all because her friends son plays sports. She constantly compares me to my friends. It's so annoying and has been happening my own life. Help me"

I'm doing an apprenticeship as an hotel assistant manager in Germany, we have 3 weeks of school every few months. In my class the ages vary from 17 to 25, the guy we're talking about is about 20, I'm 18f. 

We've gotten into arguments before because of his arrogance and sexism, but it's getting worse day by day. He was calling another female student stupid and calling himself a genius in the meantime. I said he was stupid, which resulted in him calling me stupid and saying ' shut up, shut your mouth' about 30 times as I was trying to speak to him. He called me slurs like  whore, bitch, retard, slut and many more. I don't put up with that. He's from Egypt and tries to treat me like a woman from there, and I don't let him. This makes him more angry. 

He got into my face a few times and did as if he would hit me. He knows a little about my ex boyfriend raping me and uses his name to ' hurt' me. All over he's the worst, I can't stand him, he can't stand me. After our argument today he said his girlfriend is excited to meet me, that they want to wait outside school for me. Idk what to do, I told my boyfriend and he wants to beat him but, I don't think that's the best idea. 

What would you do ?"

This is just one example but today I was supposed to meet her at her house at 5:30, I turned up on time and there was no answer. I knew she had been at her boyfriends beforehand and assumed she was still there. I waited 10 minutes then tried calling her. No answer. Texting her. No answer. Now it’s been 30 minutes and I’m still sat on her doorstep writing this post.

Looking over this post I do seem quite overdramatic but this has happened quite a lot. It also is a bit of a kicker because we were supposed to meet to celebrate me finally starting antidepressants after a year.

I don’t want to sound selfish but I don’t think she knows how irritated I am at this. It sounds dumb but I feel like crying lmao

9996,cdky1y,TrunksAreLong,I failed at university miserably and I'm getting kicked out by the end of July.,"Hello r/advice, throwaway acc for privacy reasons. Sorry if the text isn't very coherent, I'm quite emotional at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I (23M) am stuck in a sticky situation. I got into a Computer Science Bachelor's+Masters program (3y+2y) in 2014/15, however I have failed to earn 60 credits in 5 years of studying. I'm not dumb by any stretch of the imagination, but I failed to put in the work required to pass the courses.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a completely desperate place at the moment and today (when I found out I wouldn't be able to keep studying next year) the commute home was very rough, filled with ill desired thoughts that hadn't plagued me in some time.

For some context, I have lied through my teeth to my parents about my progress in school over and over again. They expect me to be in the middle of my 4th year (4 out of 5 completed, I don't even have 1/5). I have disappointed them immensely and my heart aches with pain every time I think of it. For the past 5 years I have tried, during certain periods, dedicating myself to the studies. I have, at times, deleted most apps from my phone, deleting games from my computer waking up early etc. However I have a procrastination vice that haunts me and I never end up focusing myself on the important tasks. Most of the time I spent home is spent masturbating, playing video games, watching anime/movies/youtube or doing sports (jiu jitsu, boxing, volleyball, running etc).

&amp;#x200B;

I have excused myself over the long commute I have to do every day to college (about 50min-1:20 each way) and the fact that I live completely alone, away from my family (120km away).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do from here, really... I feel like if in 2 weeks I don't have a solid plan, I will end up in a body bag. And that is scaring me, a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I can re-enroll after a year of being on break, so on the school year of 2020/21 I'll be able to sign up again for all the classes I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got a girlfriend (who's absolutely fantastic) but I haven't told her this. I'm so scared guys... I told her when we were first texting that I was starting my masters (dumb lying son of a bitch). 3 months into dating I am completely destroyed on the inside. I'm going to meet her tomorrow and I'm going to start by telling her the truth. I'll start there.

&amp;#x200B;

But other than that I don't know what to do. My parents have been the nicest possible (we're not super wealthy, but we do ok), my mom had to take a lot of shit from my lazy ass (I had a hard time cleaning after myself for some time and she would often come by to help me out). I feel like I have let them down and they don't even know it. I just want to make them happy because they deserve it. My mom recently enrolled herself in a masters program so she could advance her career and I'm gutted inside that I can't even complete my fucking degree. I don't know if I can tell them the truth because it will destroy them. They wanted me to do so well and have supported me through countless situations and I never managed to deliver.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm out of options and I really need some advice because I feel I have no where to turn to. If you need more information please ask. I may have skipped some details."
28223,8ns9jy,nextxoxexit,"M.I.L. in an Abusive Relationship, Blames Herself.","Hi everyone. Im in a situation I feel pretty helpless about, and would love if I could get some perspective. Sorry for the length TL;DR at bottom. My mother In Law is a good woman. She raised 4 boys with her ex\-husband and holds a decent job at a bank. Not to mention being beautiful and very independent. When her and her Husband broke things off she went on to marry another man who beat her to a pulp. She doesnt talk much about it but claims it was years of physical abuse and she had to leave for her own safety. She moved 3 hours away just to escape him. 

Fast forward to now\- shes dating a guy named Sam. Theyve been together around 4 years. Now I didn't like Sam from day 1. But I figured it was mostly due to our vast differences. Im a vegetarian, hes a big game hunter. Im a democrat, hes a Trump humper. Despite this I would grin and bear it around him for the sake of the family and because he hadn't actually done anything to deserve my dissaproval. But in my gut\- Sam gave me a bad vibe.

Eventually, its brought to my attention that Sam was stripped of his medical Liscence as a practicing MD. When I further looked into why\- It disturbed me. He has sexually assulted 6 clients. One being a 16 yr old girl. I didnt have much detail beyond that but it was grounds enough for him to lose his practice. When it was brought up to my MIL she claimed the women had lied and justice had been denied to Sam. I obvioulsy didnt buy that but its her concern\- not mine. We just told her her grand daughter would no longer be staying the night at her place when Sam the sex offender was over. 

Then around January I get a call from Her. Sam was ripping the house appart. Punching holes in the wall, smashing her dinning room set, breaking her fine china etc. She had herself locked in a bathroom cause he had tried to hurt her but she manged to get away. I begged her to call the cops\- she wouldnt cause he would lose his guns \(eye roll\) if he had a domestic on his record. I had her call his parents and they came and got him and took him to their house to cool off. She goes on to tell me this isnt the first time this has happened and that he tells her what a fat P.O.S she is daily \(shes VERY skinny btw\) amongst other mentally abusive things like how worthless she is and pathetic. The following day she took him back and claimed it was a mix of him drinking and her nagging him about bills. I didnt argue it with her cause its her buisness/life. 

Then 2 weeks ago I get another call. Sam was fired from his job. Why? He had been sleeping with his female boss. Apparently Sam and my MIL went out to eat that weekend and ran into Sams boss who was then made aware Sam was actually taken. So she terminated him that following monday. My MIL was heartbroken. This affair had gone on for 6 months unbeknownst to her. Sam denied every bit of it with his life until screen shots were sent by the Boss to my MIL, at which point his actions were undenyable. 

Upon discussing this further with my MIL it turns out this was the SIXTH woman in the FOUR years theyve dated that she knows of. I begged her to leave. This was obviously repeat behavior. She stayed. Sams now unemployed and shes stuck paying the mortgage, his truck payment, his motorcycle payment, groceries, utilites etc. On her own, cause of HIS affair. 

Yesterday I get a call. Shes in Hysterics. Sam was arrested. He beat her near to death. The neighbors heard her screaming and called the cops. Chunks of hair missing, broken nose, I mean BAD. Shes lucky to escape with her life. She promises its over, she filed for an order of protection. His parents were coming to get his things. Sam was in jail for the night. I cried cause he could have killed her. Shes a tiny woman and hes a huge man. 

This morning I text to see how she is and surprise surprise, she making excuses for him. He was drunk, stressed over money, she antagonized it. She misses him\- she doesnt want to lose him. I want to scream at her for being dumb but I stay calm, and tell her he almost killed her and that he is NOT a good man. She wont hear of it. She loves him. 

Why is it that her previous marriage that was abusive she walked away, but with Sam she lets him get by on anything!? I can't talk sense into her. Im 100&amp;#37; convinced if she allows him back in he will kill her next time. Her 4 sons want to kill Sam but she threatens to write them off if that say or do anything to him. Is there Anything her or my husband \(her son\) can do!? Or do we just have to let the inevitable continue to take place?

TL;DR MIL is with physically and mentally abusive man who is also unfaithful unemployed. She defends him even after him almost killing her. Trying to figure out how to get her away from him, if possible. "
16015,bk9k9u,stitchgirl626,Should I tough it out in my current job for a promotion next year or apply for another role internally?,"I’ve been working at my current company for 3 years now and started right out of college. The first two and a half years were on a team that I adored doing challenging and rewarding work. Recently, as a result of a restructure, I was moved onto another team. The new role was a lateral move with no change in salary or title but it has significantly less challenging work and (in my opinion) fewer opportunities to advance. I love my colleagues on the new team though and this is the first time in my career that I’ve had peers my age. 

My manager and I have spoken about my career progression. Their advice is that I’ve done everything asked of me and more but that I just need to be patient and wait for career progression. Now, that sounds simple but I’ve been stuck at my current title level for 3 years. The expected experience for this level is 1-2 years, and I’m not the only one on this new team who is delayed in advancing. Im also the only remaining former intern at the company who has not yet been promoted past my level. I would’ve been considered for promotion this year if not for the forced team transition. Honestly I am frustrated, depressed, and at a tipping point in my ability to be patient. 

Another role similar to my current one but at the title level right above mine opened up recently on another team. I discussed my interest with my manager who was surprisingly offended (they constantly say that they want us to explore growth opportunities) and dismissive of my interest. 

So now my conflict is do I tough it out in my current role and deal with the frustrations of unclear responsibilities and administrative work in the hopes of a promotion next year OR do I risk offending my manager/colleagues and apply for a job (that I may not even get) that would be only somewhat more satisfying but likely comes with a title promotion and salary increase?

They cancel all my regular doctor checkups, my therapy appointments for anxiety and depression, and my dentist appointments. Even though I’m 17 right now, if I were to reschedule any doctor appointment, she would be right behind me cancelling it.
In 6 months, they have made it clear they are kicking me out. However, they aren’t giving me any money or support to help me until I find a job or home to stay in. I can’t stay with either of my parents as my father is homeless half the country away, and my mother is also homeless. But, I don’t want to stay there. I’m emotionally abused and cussed out on a daily basis, told that I should’ve been aborted, and that if I were to commit suicide, it would be okay because they can just have more grandkids. 
I’m not sure what else to do. I can’t live with a friend, because I don’t have any. I’m not allowed to hang out with friends, and they aren’t allowed to hang out with me.

What am I not prepared for/need to know?","Hey all, I hope this is the right subreddit for this. My husband and I have talked about getting out of Cincinnati as long as we have been together (5 years) and now the time has come. We want to move to Tampa due to already having a friend group down there, the culture being more fitting for us, and it providing better opportunities for our chosen career paths. 

That being said, we've never moved across the country before (16 hours!) And we have three cats, so trying to accommodate them will be tricky. We had planned on getting a UHaul truck and towing my husband's car behind it (I don't have a license), and my friend has volunteered to go check out apartments in person in the area in our stead. My job can also transfer down there, but my husband's cannot, so we would have to find him a new job. We're not planning to move until April 2020, and are planning to have about 3-5k in savings (not including checking) to make it possible. 

So, people who have navigated this situation, what am I letting slip through the cracks? I really could use advice on how to make a large move like this possible.

30885,8bxlrc,AyeDood,I like this girl but she seems very different to me. What to do?,"So I met her at a party, we barely talked but she seemed interested, added me on insta the next day and like my posts.

I REPEAT! IF YOU ARE UNDER TWENTY ONE OR HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH THIS SUBJECT, GET OUT NOW!!

Sorry for yelling. Anyway, hi. I am not the kind of person that reaches out for help. You see, trust doesn't easily come to me. I have been betrayed by others more times than I can count. Yet, I have to try. I could really use your opinion, experience, feelings or something so I can understand how to live on.

It all started from the time I (boy) was raped by my babysitter (male, in his 40s) when I was 6. Objectively, I should not make a big deal out of it, I mean, I didn't even understand what was going on. Actually, who the hell hires a 40-year-old babysitter anyway? When it happened, I think I thought to myself that that adult was playing quite a strange game... until he came in my butt... then nonchalantly washed my butt in the sink. And asked my not to tell my parents (I told them. My mom started heavy 2-pack-a-day smoking. She died 12 years later, leaving me to raise my 8 year-old brother at the time). It was fun. How can it not be, after all, when you're 6, any game is fun. Surprise! It wasn't... To my mind at least.

Growing up, I used to dream of the things I did that day. Perhaps as a way to make sense of these things in my sleep. My childhood dreams were full of cartoons, childhood friends, nursery rhymes and tasty treats. One very important element was added after I was raped; penises. Now I dream of my kindergarten friends, we would be playing a game or riding the tire swing, but all of a sudden, erect penises come out, and everyone is lowering everyone's pants and are humping everyone. All boys. How many nights did I have this recurring nightmare? I don't know, but I would say at least once a month, until my mind finally formed some kind of repressive mechanism until I gradually forgot all about it around the age of 11.

Except that I didn't. Or at least, I, my conscious self, have moved on, while my subconscious self, is still scarred from having to live a double life, as instructed by my parents. I would have to keep this is a secret, because if I didn't, the sky will fall and everyone will die (because 6 year-olds are not normally secretive, that's one way you convince a 6 year old to actually keep a secret).

At least I did that part right (until now). I believe this probably cost me something, because the price of keeping that secret was really steep. I was no longer being myself. I had to become artificial in order to continue my life. I suppose, others picked up on that, with their intuition somehow. It might have made me seem suspicious or up to something. This is really bad for a child, and even worse for a teenager. You know why? It is a teenager's job to find his place with the rest of his peers (hence the obsession with high-school popularity and its implications). The problem was, I did NOT belong to ANY group? Am I a leader? Cheer leader? Smart kid? Average kid? None. I was none of the above. Back then, and until now, I belong to NO group. This is probably why I am in another country now. This is how adults run away, I suppose.

Anyway, I turned to my parents' religion to find some respite and to heal myself (Islam) and around the age of 20, discover that the whole foundation of my faith, the mathematical miracles of the Quran, were a lie (the math doesn't check out if you actually do it). My faith in God has not been the same since.

This is probably taking much longer than what you signed up for, I'm sure, and thank you for reading this far and I'm very sorry that I had to expose you to any of this, so I'll sum up; It has been over 20 years, and now, after miraculously graduating pharmacy, I am unable to finish the last step and get my license by taking the final test (that examines everything you ever studied). I mean, maybe deep down, I, as a person who felt like I belong to no group, don't see myself as the kind of person who is trustworthy enough to deserve to take care of public health?

I don't honestly know why I can't focus. My mind simply refuses to cooperate, because however smart I might be or have been, my mind always wants to run away and dwell on every single mistake I have ever made. Maybe it's merely expending half of its energy at all times to keep me from killing myself. It's like living my life with only half my attention at all times. In fact, a lot of people hate this about me because I always seem to drift off. It could take me a full 3 seconds before I can respond to a stranger saying hello.

The question is: If you were me, therapists aside (I don't trust them) what would you do for your career and mental-health? How would you move on?

Back when I was in high school, \~6 years ago, I did something public, embarrassing, and borderline creepy.  Probably many people know about it, I don't know who or how many though.  Although I'm over it personally, it has been a large block in motivation for me lately.  I'm getting to the point in my life where I'm starting to date people, but I'm terrified that if they post a picture on social media of me, or if I do of them, or anything along these lines, my past will be brought up by someone.  Not necessarily that I'm trying to hide it, but let's just say if someone from high school brought up my past to a significant other of mine, I feel that they would not want to talk/be with me anymore.

I'm just starting to date someone new and things seem to be going well.  But if it ever gets to the point where things are shared on social media, or if I change my relationship status, let's just say I'm terrified.

I need some advice to get myself past this, and what to say if anything ever comes up.  I know, I know, ""it was high school, many years ago, I was dumb and young"", but still.  There's that lingering feeling of ""you'll never have a long term relationship because of this"".

Miraculously, somehow my best friends aren't aware of this, as they're not too active on facebook/instagram etc.

It's been quite a while since then.  I've matured both mentally and physically, however I cannot shake this feeling of me essentially commiting a ""social suicide"" and how it might affect my future.  Any advice is greatly appreciated."

I’m looking for a new one right now but I’m scared to take it if I get hired because I don’t know how long I’ll be able to do it and I don’t want to waste their time. It is sort of over my skill level as I have anxiety and suck at talking to people on the phone or in general, but that’s the job and I figured it’s good money and helps me develop personal skills since I never did. 

How do I get myself up out of bed every day and not end up killing myself? I already just baseline have suicidal thoughts a few times a day but I wouldn’t because I don’t want to hurt anyone. But the more stressed I get, the more off the rails I get. And any simple thing stresses me out because I feel so unmotivated and freaked out that my body feels like I have the flu like when your bones hurt I feel that every day and doing anything is a mental block and is painful and going to work is going to really really fuck me up again but I’m already fucked up when I don’t do anything at all?

For some backstory; I’m currently 23 years old, I wasn’t raised by my parents, my nan raised me until I was six years old before she passed away, after that my (great) uncle raised me until he passed away two years ago so i’m no stranger to losing family members extremely close to me. I was somewhat close to my pop before my (great) nan passed away five years ago, I would visit them three/four times a week at least as my uncle who raised me was their son and we were all close. During this I’ve also lost two other uncles within this five year span, and a good friend at the start of the year 

My extended family aren’t close but we aren’t distant, we see each other a few times a year at most just for milestone birthdays. I am also the only /group/ in my family that wasn’t raised by parents as my siblings and I are the only Indigenous children and we were raised separate from each other too, so I have always felt a bit left out and different and have always struggled to be myself around my cousins and their parents even though they’re my uncles/aunties/cousins themselves

Over the last year and passing of my guardian I moved into my own home with my boyfriend and am still finding it hard to let go of all the grief I’ve experienced in such a short amount of time because I feel like it’s a lot to lose six people in five years. But upon this, his passing has been the most difficult understandably and I still don’t know how to navigate life properly as everything still reminds me of him 

Alongside all of this I’ve had other personal issues happen in the last year which have caused minor ptsd and increased my social and general anxiety so I’ve found it hard lately to leave my house for things other than work or study

Where i’m currently at with all this is, am I a bad person if I don’t go to the funeral? 

I know everyone there will be in the same boat, we are all sad and grieving and have lost someone important to us. I feel dumb even typing this out the more I say but I am having extreme anxiety to the point where I’ve been having minor panic attacks and am finding it hard to calm down, I have this feeling of impending doom and like my family may be cursed. I’m scared to go because what if I lose one of them next in a short amount of time and don’t have time to grieve my last loss? I feel this is how it currently goes. I don’t want my family to think bad of me or look down on me and don’t want to let anybody down, but i’m also scared about how I will react at any amount of time being in a closed room with people experiencing loss as well, as I’m very emotional and sensitive. Because my pop was my uncles dad I know he will show up in a lot of photos and speeches as well while seeing his remaining sibling being there too. I feel selfish that I can’t get past this. 

I’m sorry if this is painting me out to be a bad person, I’m struggling to connect my thoughts with words and I don’t know how to process what I’m feeling"

33890,81qi76,ParentingThrowaway23,How do I convince my mother to stop wiping my thirteen year old younger brother's butt,"Hi /r/Advice sorry if this doesn't fit but I don't know where else to turn. I (20 mtf) have been away from my mother (43 f) for all of my life and just got into contact with her a few months ago and we've had a great relationship until recently, I got a call yesterday to come over and watch my little brother (13 m). She will not leave him home alone I thought this was strange but didn't think anything of it until he went to the bathroom. After about a half hour I hear him banging on the wall I thought he fell or hit something so I asked through the door if he was alright he said yes I went to go sit back on the couch and he opened the door standing with his pants and underwear down around his ankles and said ""Well arn't you going to help me."" I didn't think that it would be appropriate for me to wipe a 13 year old so i told him ""No you can do that yourself."" He got angry and screamed and started slamming the bathroom door over and over again while screaming for me to come wipe him. I sat in the front room because under no circumstances am I wiping a 13 year old's butt. I then got a call from my mother asking why I was being mean to her baby. I said I'm not wiping him and that's that. She started to talk about how i needed to do it because he doesn't know how. I told her that he's 13 years old and then she needs to teach him. This might of been a little harsh I don't know but she came back from the store early and began screaming at me for making her come home and for not helping my brother I walked out of the house in the middle of her yelling and went home. She's called me and asked to speak about what happened I haven't responded. I feel like I still like her and I do want a relationship with the family but I don't know about any of this. I'm sorry if this is too strange or doesn't make sense I'll try to  answer any questions that any of you have.

TLDR: Mother still wipes her 13 year old's ass he expected me to do it when I was watching him and when I didn't my mother came home and screamed at me and now wants to ""talk about what happened""."

Since I hit 26 I have been trying to ""settle down"" a bit. Have a residency, a bank account, the usual. 
I love the place where I live and have met loads of people over the last 3 summer seasons, now trying to get a job for the winter.
I also live in a rather busy house, there is always someone around and we share cooking often.

Somehow, I can't manage to ""fit in"" anywhere. Its more like they tolerate my presence than actually acknoledge Im there at all. Often find myself sitting at a table in between conversations and without space to contribute to any of them. 
Sometimes at parties I have no clue what to do with myself after saying hello to everyone.

I have felt the sense of belonging to a group while travelling and have always been rather extroverted. It is just the sedentary life that somehow I cant adjust to.

Im clueless. Had a head injury for the last month and its made me slow down a lot. I am starting to consider just accepting that I don't belong with a group of friends/family and somehow learn to live without it. My partner is my best friend so it shouldn't be that hard?"

I also work with her mom who's poked me about when I plan to see her daughter again. Am I doing something wrong? If her mom's resorted to talking me into trying more does that mean she's interested?

8994,cile0t,lifesucksbutidotoo,My (21F) family thinks I am taking advantage of my brother (34M)," This is long, so bare with me.

All the bad decisions I made in my freshman year sort of caught up to me all at once this year - I was put on academic probation, I was kicked out of my sorority and worst of all lines were crossed and really personal details and revenge porn of me was shared with members of my family. I don't want to know the details of who knows/saw what, but it is clear from the way they've been acting around me that all are aware something is going on.

There are five of us in total, three brothers and two sisters. I'm the youngest at 21, and my oldest brother is 34. I've never been close to any one of them. My brothers all made an effort to see each other at least every other month, they would go on trips just the three of them, etc. My sister wasn't invited either but they all get along better. I never really spoke with my two oldest brother and I kept getting into fights with the other one and my sister.

I got into a lot of trouble growing up, and my parents checked out of my life a long time ago. They paid for my tuition, housing and stuff but I guess I made a lot of decisions they disapproved of so now they don't really care.

So when everything went down, the guy I had been unofficially living with kicked me out, my friends betrayed me and I was ostracized by everyone. I thought my life was over. I had nothing going on anymore. I was honestly considering suicide, but then my oldest brother reached out to me.

I was surprised because our relationship had been nonexistent up until then. There is a large age difference between us and he moved out of my parents place pretty much as soon as he turned 18. He moved to a big city a couple of hours drive away, but even when I was dating someone who lived in his city and was down there every week I never saw him. We pretty much only interacted whenever we were both spending the holidays with the family (which even that didn't happen too often).

In spite of all that, he has been my biggest support. He is doing pretty well for himself but he can only afford a studio because of rent being so high in the city he lives in. Still, when I was avoiding his calls because I was too humiliated, he took the time off work to come all the way down and pick me up and bring me back to his place where he has invited me to stay indefinitely. He's been spending all of his free time with me. He isn't pressuring me into doing anything, even though our state very recently signed a law that criminalized revenge porn. In fact, we haven't spoken about it at all, which I am thankful for. He's been really understanding of the fact that I just want to go out and have fun and not think of anything right now.

His girlfriend, on the other hand, has been very vocal about how she thinks I should live my life. She is nothing short of insane. Not only has she been passing snide comments about everything that I do, she continuously tries to police my relationship with my brother. She is against us going out, she always butts in even when she's uninvited, that sort of stuff. She is also really concerned with slutshaming me, like she will literally tell me I'm wearing things that are ""too revealing"" around the house or that I go out too much and aren't I making the same mistakes? She also acts overly sexual with him around me. I guess the message is that I'm third wheeling or just unwanted there.

My brother caught on to this as well as to the other members of our family not being supportive and he stopped having them around. It was just the two of us lately, which was really nice.

Well, everything came to a head this weekend. My family has a beach house where we all get together every summer. I obviously didn't want to go, but my brother ended up convincing me otherwise.

My family basically waited for him and his girlfriend to go kayaking and they all ganged up on me. They all said I'm selfish for putting his relationship at risk, for making him see them as the bad guys and for basically putting his life on hold. My sister used such cruel words against me and nobody said anything so I guess they agreed. My siblings all demanded my parents no longer support me financially, and they all said I should pay my brother back for everything. My parents aren't even sure they want to let me move back home.

I tried explaining that while I agree my brother has done so much for me, they don't know how crazy his girlfriend can get and that I wonder whether she's as good for him as they think. They completely shut that down, they didn't want to hear anything of it. I told them I feel like they are treating me unfairly but they called me spoiled and entitled.

Am I in the wrong here?"

I’ve been in intimate situations before that typically would lead into sex for most people, but for some reason, I always get this sort of anxiety when it comes to taking things a step further.

For example, I was literally in a girls bed the other day, she was half naked and on top of me, but I didn’t know her too well and I was super nervous. I basically admitted I was nervous and we slowed things down, and I ended up leaving after a brief session of just basic touching and some kissing. I have difficulty initiating and making a move. Sometimes I feel like there’s something wrong with me, it’s like this anxiety just takes over to a point that is completely out of control. 

I’d really like some tips/advice because in my mind I want to have sex with some of these girls, but my anxiety just takes over.

21601,9kb89l,memememe8008,A very unique situation involving my pup that I need help with,"Hi everyone,
I’ve got a very unique situation that I would love some advice on. I’ll take you back to the start of the story, which was about 4 months ago. My puppy was about 4 months ago old and would happily be in my backyard whenever my partner or I were not home. One day , after coming home from work, my partner and I came home to my puppy looking very upset and weirdly , wet. We then shifted our focus to the fence that had a massive hole in it , it was a hole large enough for the neighbours dog to rip through and enter my backyard. Long story short, my neighbours dog had ripped the fence palings off and entered my backyard, where the dog then attacked my dog, leaving her with a puncture wound in her neck that required a vet visit that night . After this incident happened the neighbours put plywood up agains the fence in order to reinforce it and prevent their dog from entering my backyard again. This dog not work and on numerous occasions, day after day the dog would continue to rip down the fence palings very aggressively .  My partner and I felt helpless, and spoke to them on numerous occasions to which they basically replied ‘ there’s nothing else I can do’ . I had even told them that we had to keep our dog inside every day because I was too scared to keep our outside for the fear of their dog ripping though and attacking her again. We believed that if it had gotten though it would have killed her because she was so defenceless and scared. Eventually, on one evening that I was home, the dog ripped through numerous fence palings in such an aggressive manner that , to be honest , I was in tears because I was scared. I rang my partner and he was nearby because of work. He came and was very very frustrated, he rang the neighbour and told them to handle their dog because it’s ripping through our fence again. It seemed this was a catalyst for the whole situation. The fence was beyond repair and eventually the neighbour had to pay out of their own pocket to get it fixed ( although I think that’s fair as we did nothing to the fence). Following the installation of the new fence , the neighbours dog had started nibling on fence palings again, which resulted in further reinforcement of the fence. Flashback to my current situation. A few weeks ago, the neighbours dog had actually jumped over the fence and was in my backyard with my pup. Luckily, I was home and immediately called her inside. After speaking to my partner and taking into account that I needed to leave soon as I had a meeting, I had to cal the council to get it taken out of my yard. It turns out the dog was able to jump over into my yard as the neighbours had reinforced the fence with multiple sheets of plywood and kind of established a ramp for the dog to jump on. This ‘ramp’ was taken down, but the dog is still able to jump on my fence without the extra levels. As of today, the neighbours dog was on top of the fence with its whole body on my side of the fence and was about to jump over , I yelled at it telling it to get off and it did, so my pups safe . I’m waiting for a person from the council to get back to me , but the neighbours have taken no further action to prevent their dog from jumping over my backyard. With my pups attack still in my mind, I am so scared of the neighbours dog jumping over when I’m not home. I really need some advice on what to do , because every time I leave home I’m worried that he’ll jump over and injure her . My partner and I have spoken to the neighbours on numerous occasions and nothing has worked . I think they need to cage their dog or at least chain it up while they’re not home. Someone give me some advice , I’m so sick of worrying about this.  Sorry about the long post by the way "

34559,7zikhs,ChaseIsWhoIWant,Ending a friendship - am I overreacting?,"I'm looking for advice from impartial people.

To give a little background information, I recently went through a nasty split with my fiance of several years. My relationship with him, up until the dividing issue, was solid. 

I have just discovered that my best friend spent many months telling my coworkers that my relationship was illegitimate, that I was only dating him because I pitied him for his looks, and that my fiance and I were really just platonic friends but that I agreed to get married out of desperation. (To be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, I did not. She was projecting.) As a result, as I have now learned, my LEGITIMATE relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. This also includes people who I excitedly called after getting engaged and people that I had offered positions in my wedding party to. To make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. Not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance. 

I feel so betrayed by this friend that I can't imagine ever reconciling. I am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if I'm overreacting to average workplace drama.

19241,b2mgam,biteme-06,I don’t know how to start this. Questioning who I married. Even though I consider my husband my soul mate and we have a great marriage.,"Ok I really don’t even know how to explain this. And this is a throwaway because my husband knows my regular reddit. But I’m going to try. 

How my husband and I met: I moved across the country from Indiana to Washington a little over 10 years ago. I was 18 at the time and grew up in a bad home so wanted to get as far away as possible. I needed a job, a small local mom and pop deli/restaurant hired me on the spot so I took it, making minimum wage. This guy (my now husband) would come in a few times a week. It was obvious we both really liked each other and we would often eat lunch together but remained friends. It turned out he was 10 years older than me though so when he asked me out I declined and said I was to young, told him I was 18 and he agreed we would just remain friends. A few years go by. I had another relationship, we broke up, go back to the same deli I used to work at and who do I run into? He asks me out, I said yes. And the rest is history. 

Why we have some weird soulmate connection: Him and i always said that we both felt familiar with each other even though we had never met. We’ve always had some strange connection like we have known each other before. My husbands mom passed away in 2006 from cancer. The night before I ran into him again I had a dream about a woman who walked up to me in the middle of my dream and asked me why I wasn’t with her son.  I said I don’t even know who you are or who your son is. She then pointed to a man across the room (my now husband). I woke up thinking it was really strange how vivid it was and how I hadn’t seen him in a long time. Then that day, sure enough I run into him and he asks me out. Since then we have been through so much hardship and deaths/loses etc etc. we are VERY CLOSE and have great communication. 

Why I’m questioning our marriage: We now are married and have a son. My husbands family is full of many alcoholics, dysfunction and laziness. When we first met, he was living with his alcoholic brother and had been for years. My husband was working and his brother would take jobs here and there but mostly just sat and home and drank. Life happened, my husband and I moved out on our own into our place. He was constantly worried about his brother dying at his home from something alcohol/pill related but my opinion was that if his brother wouldn’t accept help, then there was nothing he can do to prevent that. Anyways, over the years we have had LOTS of issues with his family. Him and his dad have a business together that his older brother also is apart of. But they have zero ambition to do better and just do the bare minimum. His dad has screwed him over in more than one way but he continues to work with him. 

So after all of these years, him and i are ready to do bigger and better things. We want to buy a house, move out of state, have more kids etc etc. but in order to do that there are A LOT of steps we have to take. For example, my husband HAS to stop working with his dad and brother and start his own company doing the same thing/get a new job somewhere else. At this point, he doesn’t have consistent income because of how did dad runs his business. He will drink (beer) with them after work because his dad and brother both rely on alcohol so he gives in. 

I’ve talked to him so many times about how he needs to separate work from his family. They hold him back. If he had his own business, which is VERY possible and doable, we wouldn’t be stuck in the position we are. He so wants his dad and brother to want to do bigger and better things the same way he does but they don’t want too. However, my husband can’t get over that no one in his family is ever going to have a bright future. They all just do the bare minimum and have his whole life. So even though my husband wants to do better it’s like he’s stuck and doesn’t know how. He works with lazy asses all day everyday. They drink on the job (my husband does no). They leave early, get to work late. My husband says if he separates from his family then it’s going to ruin his relationship with them and he doesn’t want that to happen. For years, he’s been trying to convince his dad to do this for the business or that for the business. 

So here we are. 7 years together, 3 married. We live in a shitty rental with our son. My husband and I have a really great relationship. We communicate well, we get along, we have fun, we really do love each other. We have talked about this a lot but it’s like he just won’t take the step to separate work life from his family so we can move the hell on with our own life. He is not an alcoholic but definitely drinks more than the average person because of how his family treats alcohol. I feel like if something doesn’t change soon we are going to be stuck where we are at for a long time 

So What do I do? I’ve talked to him so many times about this. Nagged, argued. But we are still in the same position. He says yes this will change or that will change. We will do this on this day or that day. And then that day comes and he says well in a few weeks etc etc. it’s driving me crazy. My husband is so sweet, kind, humble, and a great dad.  But I feel like my whole life is going to always be doing the bear minimum and that’s not ok with me. His families motto is basically just live day by day and that’s good enough. However, I’m not like that at all and don’t think that’s right. Is that wrong of me? I want better for our son. I don’t want to leave though but what if nothing changes in 10 years. "

In fact, it's like sometimes people forget I'm there, as if they evade my existence. This happens so much that I also choose not to talk at all and figure out things by myself. Don't get me wrong, I love to interact with others and I can be very outspoken, I'm even the representative of my class, but no one seems to care when I want to express something. For example, when it comes to organizing school stuff, I ask someone else to speak for me because even if I'm not afraid to talk in front of the other students, I know I won't be heard. In another context, when I meet someone not so long after I genuinely think they forgot about me because they also start to ignore me and stop saying hi to me and stuff. I don't have many friends and I want to have more but these circumstances make it difficult for me to be more sociable and develop almost all the skills I want.

I've read a lot of psychology books but I can't find anything that can help me with this. I don't think I'm a bad person, the few friends I have think I'm genuinely funny and kind, but all of this lately upsets me at the point of treating others rudely and only when I adopt that posture I get noticed which severely worries me since I'm super laid back and level headed.

Is there a way I can change this? What am I doing wrong? 

I apologize if I didn't express myself very well, as English isn't my main language.

tldr; feel like no one wants to hear what I say and have a weak presence overall"

6867,ct4r1g,namthejoon,Advice for a shy incoming freshman in high school?,"Gosh this seems like such a small problem compared to everyone else’s in this group but I really need some advice. 

I’m going to a relatively big school (800 students per grade), and I already know I’m not going to have any friends. 

Most people who are entering my school are already in like 10 different group chats on social media, and they already had meet-ups and everything. Meanwhile, I’m not invited to any of the group chats and I don’t know anyone who’s going to my school yet. 

I’m just really scared that on the first day, people are going to have their own friend groups, and I’ll just become an outsider.

Having friends in this high school is really vital too because the school is known to be “competitive” and having friends can make homework so much quicker, and according to some former students, prevent you from becoming depressed.

I don’t even know whether or not I’ll be able to be social and make friends throughout my 4 years because I’m really dull, quiet, and awkward when I first meet someone.

Please give me advice on how I can be more friendly and approachable."
14720,bqmhri,MK_Pierce,The saddest thing in the world is listening to a little old lady cry on the telephone.,"Quick background:

My parents are high up in their professions respectively, so they were working 7-5 during the week. My older brother was his own version of Dennis the Menace, so daycare was no longer an option. My parents hired a day nanny, we’ll call her Kay. At the time, she was 57, and had just been divorced. She has 1 child, who married and had 3 kids. From what I understand, her daughter in law and Kay did not get along so well, so it caused her and her son to grow distance, but it was always okay because she always had my brother and I. 

She loved my brother and I unconditionally, and was with our family every day until I turned 14 or 15 (I’m the youngest) but the relationship we developed was like having a 3rd parent, or even having a 5th grandparent. Even after her time with us ended, we always remained in touch, and I would still visit her whenever I had a chance, and call her a few times a week just to chat. She always came to our birthday parties, and just became a part of the family. 

Fast forward to now: I am 22 years old, and her health is in decline. To clarify, I knew her health was declining, but I didn’t know how bad it actually was. 

Kay did her best to shield any details from my family and I, but I returned home for spring break and actually took her to her primary care. She always had problems with her knees from an injury she sustained some time ago, and now it pains her to walk. 

She had a BP of 202/97, was diagnosed with non-diabetic neuropathy, and is in need of a double knee replacement. Until I had gotten on her case about eating, she would only eat 1/2 a meal every day or so, so she currently is dealing with chronic weight loss. (I didn’t know she wasn’t eating.) She is also clinically depressed. Her doctor has prescribed her antidepressants in the past, but idk if she is taking them, along with a slew of other meds she’s on, but she assures me she’s taking all meds as recommended. 

I call her every day, and she is always down, and often crying; fun fact, the saddest thing in the world is listening to a little old lady cry on the telephone. 

She needs people to help take care of her. I’m currently away from home on an internship, so that greatly effects my ability to see her. My brother goes grocery shopping for her, and her neighbor cuts her grass, and helps her around the house, but she needs someone there all the time. I contacted an organization that has been providing her with some PT, Occupational Therapy, and a nurse to come twice a week, but they won’t see her for much longer, as they specialize in post surgery care. They have referred me to an agency that specializes in care for the elderly, but it’ll be another 2 weeks before anyone can come interview her to see if she meets requirements. 

She is currently on Medicare, and has a very small monthly income, but not so small she can qualify need based (even tho the money she gets equates to a working person receiving $9USD/hr.) 

She is currently an extra $200 a month over this organizations monthly income limit from being accepted on a needs based standard, but the woman from the agency assured me that there might be something they can do. 

In the event that she doesn’t qualify for the in home healthcare, I really don’t know what to do. 

Her son is so apathetic to the state of his mother, in my eyes one of the kindest people to walk the Earth, that it feels like he’s just waiting for her to die. I just don’t understand how someone could be so apathetic to their own mother. I understand that no parent is perfect, there is no way he could be getting enjoyment from watching this little old woman suffer, regardless of what may or may not have happened between them. 

A retirement home/ assisted care facility is also not an option for her (she can’t afford it.) 

I live in the US, so if there is anyone out there that knows a way to get care to the elderly, when they desperately need it, please help me."
16080,bjxyu2,Freidjr,I feel like I've lost intelligence and got dumbed down,"I graduated from high school a year ago. I had decent grades, didn't really had to try hard to memorize and do school work. It was all pretty easy, and I had a great deal of understanding and  intuition for how thing are supposed to be solved etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I always was kinda depressed, felt down a lot, but masked it with some dumb sarcastic and dark humour. I never got any diagnosis. When I heard from the school psychologist that I once visited, that she suspects that I might be suffering from depression and anxiety, I got a panic atack, started shaking like I never did before. So, to not get a diagnosis I just never got another appointment again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I started to work to spare some money before I start to go to university. Today I come out of work and tried to calculate my salary for today, and I struggled witch that more than I would have before. That is just one of the situations when I feel that my mental capacity is lacking more than ever before. I was never an extraordinary genius, but I was able to do more than I do now. I struggle to find the right words while speaking, my memory got much worse, and I have to hear the same thing significantly more times than before, to actually understand and remember what is being said. The weird thing is that I feel much happier now (although I am a little more stressed probably). I would suspect that feeling better would improve my mental capacity, but the opposite happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why could that be? I really need some advice here as it is affecting my daily life. I struggle to say what I think, and I sometimes even struggle to understand what I think. I am getting paranoid about this."

31828,88cbct,DHiram98,"Smells good, looks good, and tastes good. Is it safe to eat past expiry date?","I don't believe this post breaks any rules, but I'm just asking here for some quick answers as I couldn't find an appropriate subreddit I'd get quick replies on.

I know it might come as a stupid question to some, but I'm genuinely curious. Normally we're good at tossing stuff out when it expires just to be safe, but we noticed a totally unopened tub of sour cream in our fridge that expired back in October. So it's nearly 6 months expired, and upon opening it I expected it to smell and look awful, but it actually looked 110% okay. No funky smells, as it smelled identical to the fresh tub we got today. I mixed it around and it had the same texture and consistency, no visible signs of mold, not even in little specks. Put a tiny dot on my finger and gave it a quick taste and the taste was also identical to the new one we just opened.

I'm use to things like yogurt going visibly bad after just a week after expiration, but I'm curious why something as prone to mold as sour cream by all means appears to be totally fine for consumption 6 months after the expiry date. We're more than likely going to toss it, but would it really be safe to consume in full at this point considering all this?"
4361,d75nn0,LazyHobbit_,I often have to tell my mother to turn the tv down and it has me concerned on multiple levels.,"I’m 27 and still live at home because of money reasons. I work and pay for everything I have. Parents are fine with it. 

I tell my mother all the time that I go to bed at 10 and I have to get up early for work. But she always forgets this somehow. I’ll be in my room and the tv is so loud it sounds like it’s on right in front of me. So I have to get up and remind her. This happens so often. So has no apparent problems with memory. She knows exactly what’s going on because the instant she hears my door open she starts turning it down. She apologizes each time, and does indeed turn it down. But it’s driving me insane because it seems he only moments of silence I have in my life right now are my drives to work in the morning. 

Furthermore, I have a severely handicapped brother. He is 38 and around the mental age of 2 or 3. It’s more or less like having a toddler in the house. He gets out to bed well before I go. But my parents will continue to watch the tv with booming volume, while his room is right next to the living room. I notice that he naps a lot on the couch during the day so I’m wondering if that has something to do with it. It makes me livid. 

There have even been times when my brother has made some noise or gotten louder than he really should be. What does my mom do? She turns the tv allllll the way up to drown out his noise, passive aggressively trying to get me or my dad to take care of him. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s driving me insane. I’ll bring it up to them, they’ll do good for a while, but then it starts up again. They humor me on it, but don’t take me too seriously. What do I do?"

So I also told another one of my friends and she reacted differently. Shes a pro at setting people up, so obviously thats why I told her. She even set up two of my best friends. So she found out stuff about him and told me hes really shallow and only likes girls for their looks. But I still was disappointed by this because he seemed funny and nice. 

I wanted to talk to him and see if he had a nice kind side. The only problem is he is kind of dating this girl (its complicated) but not officially dating. 

Im worried if I try to talk to him and be his friend Ill come off as selfish or rude or something because he already likes a girl.

What should I do? I wanna be his friend either way because he seems cool and nice. If he turns out to be really cool and nice then maybe more than a friend. But Im worried hes the shallow type of guy."
18543,b6q1n0,struggling2016,I regret my abortion 3 years later,"I made a throwaway because some family knows my main and I haven’t even told my own mother about this ..

This is long, I’m sorry, so TLDR : I was raped and had an abortion at 13 weeks. I have a son now,I think about the fetus almost everyday, and it’s destroying my mental health and making me hate myself. I can’t afford therapy and don’t know how to cope.

Back in 2016, I got into an argument with roommate and went to stay over at a mutual friends house. He was really supportive and let me rant through my problems. He offered my a drink, and the next thing I remembered, I was naked in his bed with him. 

I was not remotely attracted to him, he had a long term girlfriend and I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship, so I know I would not have done this sober. I started panicking and vomit everywhere. I called my roommate and she called 911. They found rohypnol in his apartment and I was very bruised internally and also around my wrists and neck where they say he must have held me down. The hospital tested me for every std in the books and my arms were heavily bruised from all the needles. I was brought into an office room sometime later where I had to repeat my story an endless amount of times to some officers. Everything was a haze, I don’t remember most of it. My roommate picked me up and we stayed in watching movies for a couple days. I couldn’t process what happened, it felt like I was in a fever dream that wasn’t ending. 

I missed my period at the start of the month, and my roommate bought me a test. We sat and held hands as it processed and it was positive. I couldn’t believe it. My entire life was falling apart because of this man. I stayed up all night crying and the next day I called some hotlines. 
Unfortunately, one I called was a Christian in disguise one. They scheduled me to see one of their counsellors who told me abortion would make the trauma hurt more. I listened, for awhile. When I was past 8 weeks, they told me it was too late for the pill abortion and I would need surgical. They told me what they did to the fetus and I swore I couldn’t do it. 
I was 10 weeks pregnant whenI went to a clinic and they scheduled me for an ultrasound. The baby was waving his nubs and the technician was pointing at how cute it was. I realized as much as it was my baby, it was also that mans. I loved it and was scared of it all at once. I couldn’t give it up for adoption, because it might turn out like him. But I couldn’t raise a baby that might look identical to him. I realized I had to abort it. I left the ultrasound and held the scan photos for hours crying. 

I was booked for an abortion 3 weeks later. No one went with me. They had a communal room where all the women who just had an abortion were sat. Most were snacking on the food they gave us, I was dry heaving trying not to make a scene. I didn’t have the money to pay for it, and I ended up having to spend my student loan. I failed the course and have 20,000$ in debt that keeps building. 

I have a 6 month old baby boy now. I love him but I look at him and think about the fetus I aborted. I have never been religious but I sometimes wonder if it’s in heaven hating me, and that I deserve to go to hell for what I did. I want to be a good mother but I can’t. I feel like I’m being tortured by the choice I had to make because of what that man did to me. 

My boyfriend is not the best as support, though he tries to listen, it is not his personality. I am not close to my family and I don’t feel comfortable telling them anyways. I can’t afford therapy, I am already in severe debt from the loans I had that year for a course I failed.  I don’t know what to do. It’s so hard. I go to sleep crying almost every night, numb all day, because it keeps going through my head. Any advice would be great.. thank you "

22117,9ie6pg,101rsmith,"I don't know how to proceed in my relationship with my ""best friend""","I've been struggling over the last few days with my relationship with a person I considered myself close with. I've been in a friendship for over 4 years with my friend that's been a bit of a struggle; they suffer from schizoaffective disorder and early on in our friendship her only brother passed away. I tried to be understandable with their issues and have been patient with them, hoping that after a few years they would naturally get out of their shell and want to make genuine effort into life. However there's always been issues with communication; I always had to set up plans for us to do something, often having to text them multiple times to get a simple confirmation despite the fact that we'd talk and agree upon things beforehand. As well I had a crush on them and would constantly have to regulate my feelings and temperament around them while being completely honest, I was always transparent to them but I truly did care about them as a friend, however I always had to force myself to look the other way whenever their mental issues came into play such as the lack of communication or them getting drunk in public and embarrassing us.


   The last year and a half have been a difficult time, mainly on myself for what I was going through and how I was handling life. My grandmother who I was close with died and I enter and exited a highly dramatic relationship all within the same month. When it was time for the funeral I asked if they could make it but I never got a direct answer, their mother had to inform me that my friend couldn't attend as they hadn't been to a service since their brother died and it could possibly cause them to have a mental breakdown. I was disappointed they couldn't show up when they would always say they'd be there if I truly needed them, on top of that I was extremely hurt when I we had to attend a funeral for a friend I had introduced to them six months prior and they were gung ho about being despite the fact I'd known them for 3 years and they weren't there for me. I was beginning to catch them in lies about not wanting to be around; they cancelled on a movie day saying they were in a dark place in their mind, however another friend showed me a text conversation where my friend said they didn't want to deal with me. The most hurtful thing was how they intergrated into my friendship circle and I began to feel phased out, they began to make plans without involving me  which I was supportive of but I could tell they just jived well with them in comparison and felt left behind. At the same time I was slowly being kicked out of my friend group as they were getting tired of my problems and how it affected them, my best friend would talk about me behind my back and discuss my mental health and therapy without referring or asking about it to me first which left me feeling betrayed and that I was becoming a gossip topic amongst my friends when I'm not around.



All of the issues cultivated in me committing suicide and ending up in a mental hospital over the summer, I was done with life and didn't want to keep losing people that I cared about. My friend did reach out and suggested we take a break, they reached out a few weeks later wanting to talk about things but I was so bitter and resentful I couldn't speak with them without breaking into a fit. I decided to communicate with them by writing a letter to them, explaining how I felt and how their issues had plaguing our friendship and how exhausted I felt. It took about two months to hear from them but we finally talked about it. They were hurt by what they said but understand where I was coming from. I told them despite my anger and resentment I wanted to work things out with them and tried to ask for a compromise, when we got to the barebones it finally came to light that they themselves resented me. While their feelings have been amplified over the last year or so due to my issues they always considered me a draining and exhausting experience, only playing around to not hurt my feelings and not wanting to add to my problems. They resented me for my kindness and how much trust I give them on top of the presents and effort I gave them. In order for our friendship to continue I have to get my issues handled but they won't change anything themselves on their end, they won't guarantee any respectful amount of communication or to see me on a somewhat regular basis. They flat out said ""once you get your shit together you can deal with me being a shitty friend, it won't matter if I come through. You'll say fuck it and do the things you want to do, me not being there won't effect your decisions"".


While I initially felt positive about our talk I became broken up by what was said. My ""best friend"" phoned in our entire friendship because they felt pity over me, and I have to do all the work to make them feel comfortable and keep their presence but they won't even lift a finger to change or accommodate me. I feel like I'm in a mindfuck, I honestly don't know what's real and what's not anymore and I just feel like killing myself. I haven't been perfect throughout this friendship, I can be obnoxious and annoying, plus admittedly I've been difficult to be around the last year. Still I genuinely cared for my friend and all the times we've spent together, they played an important part of my life the last four years to the point where they and their family where a part of my college graduation. I want to make this work so badly because I want them in my life and don't want all this time I spent with them to be in vain, but essentially they're telling me ""you need to get your shit together for yourself, but you need to expect nothing from me and be happy with what you get"" and I know for a fact that they are making genuine effort with my former circle, so why I do have to get the short end of the stick when I've been so loyal and worked so hard for them? I don't know what to do."
6424,cvi6bx,yuenyuenqueen,Just turned 28. What advice would you give me?,"Hi all! Just yesterday, I turned 28 (F). To those 28+, as a ""passerby"", what advice would you give me?

A ""passerby"" might be a bad metaphor, but I don't want to say a ""survivor"", as it would make life sound tough - I mean it is, but it's also beautiful isn't it?

Here's a little bit of my background if it helps. But I would love love love to get advice in any aspect! 

I come from a big Asian family with strong family bonds. However, due to my study and career, I never really stayed home for a continues time after I turned 18. So 3 years ago, I quit my full-time job in an international bustling metropolis and moved back to my hometown, and since then I've been living with my family.

There are pros and cons living with family. 

Pros are I finally feel like I'm part of this big family (in the past, I only met them during new year or on the big family days), and I've accumulated a little bit saving. I've got more money to travel around and learn something new. Working in a big city didn't really help to accumulate wealth. And my mom has been taking care of my health, which I'm extremely grateful for. She's a nutrition and an expert in TCM. 

Cons are that I don't get to have a my own space living with an Asian mom (I love you Mom). On the other hand, freelancing doesn't help in building my career, especially my expectation is to work towards a management position. 

This year marks the 3 year of my freelance career life. I'm a documentary producer. As I've lived my entire life in my home country, I've been looking to get some experiences overseas. I'm not married. I guess that's a vantage in this case? 

See I really really want to go abroad - or at least back to a big city to build a career. At this age, I don't think I can afford to lose any more time. On the other hand, I'm quite worried about my mother. If i'm not there, she would be living alone. She's not in a good physical condition. Although my relatives are living close-by, if any accident happened, they couldn't be able to know and be there right away. My family understands going out would be good for my career and development and stuff, but they also have the same worries as I do. 

So, that's a little of my current situation. **Any advice** *(doesn't have to be related to my background)* **for a new 28(F) is welcomed!**"

Even before the accident he would always try to get me to buy him things.. Today i decided i would get him something and while we were talking about it he said he wanted something that was over 200! i obviously refused  and he got extremely mad at me!

15478,bms49b,throwawaygocubs,How to deal with an annoying sibling?,"My older brother [18] is being a jerk to me [15M] and I’m still not sure how to deal with it. He always seems to try to get a rise out of me and I can’t help but go off on him for doing stupid things. He’ll unlock the bathroom door and throw cold water in the shower while I’m showering, he’ll purposefully set off arguments between my parents which he knows makes me upset. He also never seems to give up the fact that he’s older than me. When I was younger I had a high voice and a speech impediment, but now my voice is low and normal but he still mocks my old voice which I was made fun of when I was younger by others at school. How the fuck do I deal with him?"
23305,9dpcev,bluberry_muffin,How can I NOT move in with my brother without offending/hurting family?,"I’m a male in my mid-20s and I have been living alone for the past 4 years. 

My immediate family is very tight-knit and we’re all on good terms (most of the times). We love to hang out together and we enjoy traveling together. As a family, our main goal is to eventually all live in the same city. So far, I’m the only one who is not living in the same city as the rest of them. 
This introduction is just to give you an idea of how my family is very family-oriented and that they would sometime get offended if you choose friends over family. 

I, on the other hand, like my alone time. I like going back home after work to an empty place, I actually look forward to it. - Don’t get me wrong though, I’m not anti-social, I love people and I love spending time with friends, but I need my alone time every other day to recover. 

I love having my own living room and my own place, I don’t wanna share a place with anyone, whether it was a friend or a brother. I like the independence that I’ve been in for the past 4 years. I like inviting people over without thinking about it or having to ask the person I’m living with, cause it’s my place. 

Also, on top of that, in the past 4 years I’ve only been progressing in my life, I’ve been discovering myself more and more everyday. I’m learning about myself, my brain and my personality, what I like and what I don’t like. I’m making mistakes and I’m learning. And I feel like I’m still not done with that process, I still need to challenge my mind and myself to learn about myself and discover who I am even more. And I truly believe that this can only happen if I’m living alone.

So, to get to the main issue. My older brother is moving to the same city where I currently live. And it is just expected by the whole family that I will be moving out of my one bedroom apartment and moving in with my brother in a 2 bedroom apartment, no one even questioned if that would bother me or anything. My older brother is excited to be living with me, but I am definitely not. I love him and I love all my family, but that does not mean that It should be assumed for me to want to move in with a family member. I actually feel that us living together will ruin my relationship with him.

My life and routine will change if I end up moving in with him. But I just can’t find the right way to get that message to my family without them getting offended. My parents, my brother and all my other siblings will think that I don’t like family anymore and that I’m trying to get away from them. It’s not that at all, I just have a different personality than all of them and I like my independence, autonomy, privacy, and alone time. 

If someone has any good advice on how to bring that up without hurting anyone, I would be very grateful.

I'm 17 and I live in a toxic home. My father is abusive and downright scary. I love my mom and sibling, but I can't stand to live with my abuser anymore. I have been seriously considering suicide lately. After a lot of thinking, I figured why not just leave? Killing myself would permanently seperate me with everyone I love and everything that makes me happy, so why not just start life over and I guess metaphorically kill old myself instead. And with that, I have made plans to leave once I turn 18.

However, I want to make sure I remain 100% untraceable. I plan on backing up my emails on a brand new and anonymous email, I will factory reset my phone and leave it behind so it can't be tracked, and I plan on changing my name (which I realize is a lengthy process). I have my birth certificate and SSN. I plan on buying a plane ticket in cash. 

Aside from bringing food, money, a means of staying warm incase I end up sleeping outside, possibly a prepaid phone if an emergency arises, identifying documents,  and of course using my brain to steer clear of dangerous situations, what else can I do or bring with me in order to leave safely? 

Thank you so much everyone."
36934,7rdzr3,M_Night_Samalam,Soon starting my first job out of college and the first six months are going to be weird.,"I'll start by saying I'm grateful to just have a job in the first place and I'm very excited, but my duties in the coming months aren't enviable.

Even less enviable are the people being laid off at a company that was just bought by the one that hired me. For the next half a year, my job is to spend every day at this bought-out company and learn from its employees -- who know their jobs have an expiration date -- every step of the manufacturing process. I'm supposed to relay this information back to my company on the other side of the USA, where they will recreate the operations over there before finally shutting down the bought-out company and having me move back to help run the new division.

So basically, my presence will be a constant reminder to these people that they're losing their jobs and being replaced. What's worse is that I'm 100% green in the industry because I'm fresh out of college. I'll have to constantly be asking them questions they may find obvious, and I'm prepared to get more than a little bit of sass and ridicule.

I don't want to come across as pitying them because of their situation, but I also don't want to let it be a perpetually unacknowledged 20-ton elephant in the room. I'm afraid I'll be spending these months as a social outcast hundreds of miles from everyone I know. Has anybody ever been forced into being the 'bad guy' like this before? Any advice on how to deal with this?"
7807,cojp7t,shawlala,How do I approach a parent that is using emotional manipulation to spend time with me when I have other responsibilities too?,"So my parents divorced back in 2003 and both of them got remarried to other people a few years later. I constantly was going back and forth between both households with my sister up until we finished high school. Now we are both in colleges that are decently far away from home, so there is not a lot of times that either of us goes to our home town except for breaks like Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

When we do come home to visit, it is always very stressful because our Stepmother always wants to spend as much time with us as possible. She works a job where she has to ask for time off months in advanced and is constantly asking us when we're planning to be home so she can plan to see us. She also gets visibly upset when we tell her that we want to hang out with friends or do something without her on what she sees as ""her time."" So basically my sister and I feel extremely pressured to be with her and it makes us want to see her less and less. 

Keep in mind that I have an entire other household that I have to split my time with and they do not pressure me or my sister at all to be there. Both my mom and Stepfather have said that it's up to me and they will be happy to see me when I have the time. I also have high school friends I want to visit and catch up with.

This has been going on for the last few years and I finally decided to tell my dad about it. He agreed with me that he has noticed it and was wondering when I was ever going to mention something. I told him I didn't know how to approach the situation because my Stepmother also gets extremely defensive and major attitude whenever we try to point out something she doesn't agree with. I told my dad I didn't really want him to talk to her about it but he said he would mention it just to break the ice.

Anyways, my Stepmother has now approached me and said she didn't ever mean to make us feel this way because she ""loves us and considers us her own children."" When I mentioned the hostile attitude she gets when we tell her we are going to be doing something else instead of spending time with her she again said it's ""because she loves us and is very disappointed when we don't spend time with her."" 

Basically it felt like she was guilting me and making me feel like shit for even bringing it up in the first place. She did say that she would try to be better, but it doesn't really feel like I got anywhere. My sister is still at college and wasn't here for the exchange, but I told her she could try giving it a shot next time she's here. I just need some advice on how to approach this from now on or if there's maybe something I can do better next time to get my point across."
652,dqnm92,Coolio9981,Advice on moving from California to Colorado/Washington (I’m 20),"Pretty self explanatory. My Mother is in debt to me for 6K that she has no intention paying back, College and living expenses are too high to pay both simultaneously (even with two jobs) and I feel like I’m just wasting my life at my current situation. 
So me and my girlfriend are trying to plan to move out to a state that’s:
1)close in proximity
2)has a lower population density
3)has a viable economy
4)and lastly, more affordable colleges after becoming citizens of said state.

So I chalked up Washington and Colorado. After doing research on the real estate prices and popular college costs, I know these two are the best shot. Only problem is now, is how to get there cost efficiently.

This is the only part of the plan I feel a bit wobbly on. So far I’ve saved 1.5K. My initial plan was for me to move out and drive up individually before my gf with a job already in one of the states (I’m in contact with a staffing agency that stationed in both states) and to temporarily work while living in a hotel, and on my off days try to get a house down and rented. And which we then use both our savings (roughly 3.5K) to hire a moving company, and then she follows suit to the house we rented.

See any flaws in the plan? Any suggestions? Would Washington or Colorado be better long-term?"

I left my computer for about 40min to go shopping. I did not realize I never actually left the call itself so the screenshare was still on. Which means I can still see his desktop.

I came back home and I was feeling a bit horny, so I called him up on his phone, he didnt answer. Called him up again and he answered, I asked him if he wanted to jack off with me on cam and he said ’’No, I am taking a nap.’’ Right as we hung up, I realized that the screenshare call on my computer was still on and that he was watching porn instead.

I do not know how to feel about him choosing porn over me and lying to me like that. What should I do? Should I confront him? How do I handle this?

19800,aznlr8,Crow-Everveil,Engineering or the trades? Career advice needed.,"Hello everyone, 

As the title states, I am looking for some advice on whether I should pursue a career in engineering or in the skilled trades. For a while now I have been thinking about pursuing a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. Mechanical, because it seems to be the broadest field of engineering that has career opportunities in lots of different industries like automotive, space, health, etc. space and alternative energy being the industries that interest me the most. I absolutely love the idea of exploring space, and alternative energy seems like a really important field to get into. Also, being an engineer in general sounds awesome to me in that it’s a field that involves a lot of math, science, real-world problem solving, and a bit of hands-on work. The problem is that college is expensive, and I don’t feel comfortable going in to debt over a degree that may not actually get me a job when I’m done. And the thought of working in a cubicle all day sounds terrible. Then I found out about skilled trades, and more importantly, apprenticeships. What’s really appealing to me about apprenticeships is that you are working(getting paid) and learning at the same time, which would be great because I could still pay the bills and eventually become a journeyman and make some decent money. So I’m trying to decide if I should go to college to try and pursue my passion? Or should I get into the skilled trades and start making decent money now and start moving on in life? What worries me about the skilled trades though is that I’ve heard it can be hard on the body, and that I would only be pursuing it because of the money/opportunity.

A little background on me. I am a 22 y/o living in the U.S. I grew up wanting to be a doctor when I was older, became a medical assistant right after high school, realized I hated working with patients after about a year. Realized that life sciences weren’t as interesting to me as the natural science were. Started geeking out over space and wanted a job where I can build and design things that go into space and wanted to be an aerospace engineer. Later on, started having interested in solar panels, electric cars, robots, and many other things. With many other interests, I figured mechanical engineering would be worth studying because it’s such a broad field. I’m looking a career that involves my interests(obviously), is a mix between hands-on work and computer work, and is a good field to get into.

Any advice would help. Thank you!"

5000,d3p6v0,misscatsadboy,(22m) Girlfriend’s (22f) lesbian online alter ego,"Hi,

Recently my (M) girlfriend had been spending lots more time online, with certain social media specifically 4-5 hours a day. She kept these hidden from me and always minimised any windows whenever I came nearby. She insisted it was nothing despite typing for hours on end.

Eventually my curiosity got the better of me and I regrettably snooped on her phone. I’m not proud of it although I’m definitely glad I did.

I found she had been posting explicit photos, flirting with strangers and one particular girl and exchanging photos with her. All the recipients were female, which I found surprising as she’s only ever had boyfriends.

At first I thought I should definitely break up with her, as this is practically cheating. Particularly as she would send these flirty messages in bed next to me, or avoiding my messages at the same time.

She describes herself completely differently on these profiles, often referring to never having been with or interested in men, different name, job, family etc.

She says it’s kind of an escape because she wished things were different, and it gives her chance to be someone else. She claims she didn’t think about it too much, being only women and didn’t consider the consequences.

It bothers me but we have been together for a long time and lived together always. If it were male recipients I think I would be out of the door but I’m on the hedge.

She says she wants to stay with me and it was a mistake, sees us getting married, 

I understand her perspective but I find it hard to believe she didn’t consider my feelings or the consequences if I found out.

I can’t make my mind up- I broke up with her but we agreed to take time apart and think if we want to give it another go."

34652,7z8afp,anon987anon654,"My younger, adult brother keeps talking to and hanging out with minors, and I think it's going to get him in trouble. What can I do?","My younger brother is 19 years old and has a wide array of friends that he hangs out with. His main friend group is guys his age, he's had girlfriends (3-ish) his age or a year older, but he occasionally hangs out with a 15 (16?) year old girl and her friends. He met the 15 (16?) year old a few years ago at something he was volunteering at, she lives in a different school district. I noticed a while back that he was snapchatting her, and I told him I didn't think it was a good idea as she is so young and there are dangers to talking to a girl that young as an adult male (like if she sends him a risque photo, if her parents don't know and find out and freak out and make crazy claims, if her friends assume something, etc.). When I talked to him about this, he said that she reached out to him and said she was going to commit suicide, and he was trying to be nice. He has a sort of savior complex and likes to be the confidant to people in need. But now that they're hanging out, I feel that it's going too far. He has also had previous infractions at jobs/volunteer opportunities for overstepping boundaries and becoming too emotionally close with younger (about 2-3 years younger) girls. I've brought this up to my mom, who is also concerned, but nothing seems to be changing. I am only two years older than my brother, but we aren't very close. I also go to a college 4 hours from home (he still lives full-time with our parents) and am rarely there besides holidays and the summer.

Is there reason to worry? Or am I being too suspicious? I am worried, but I don't know what else to do. My brother has lost most of the parental respect for my parents, and while isn't a bad or irresponsible person, doesn't listen to what the ask him to do/advise of him. "

My brother is very empathetic, and as so tries to cheer us up with his chipper attitude and jokes. However, when his guard is down, I have noticed that he's extremely worried for my father. When he heard the news, he broke down and cried. I fear he has no way to properly handle his emotions. To add to that, my mother is becoming overwhelmed.

We've been together for a few years, have spent multiple summers and trips together, and he's been approved for a Visa and we planned on him moving here in the summer, so I dont think hes ""ghosting"" me per se. This morning, (hes 7 hours ahead of me) he messaged me when he was done with work and said he was driving home and that he would talk with me in about 30 minutes and that he loves me. That's it, I haven't heard anything from him in 12 hours. He hasn't been active on any social media accounts and I dont know any of his friends, tbh he doesnt even have any. I'm worried sick, this is extremely unlike him. Is there a way that I can check public records to see if he was in an accident or something? I'm seriously losing my effing mind, This is EXTREMELY unlike him. Any advise?"

Need help,"I live in NY and 2 of my best friends moved out of state a few years ago and when they visit they always want to stay with me because I have an extra room. I always say yes . One became a stay at home mom and the other lives off her boyfriend and father at 36 yrs old. They always complain about being broke and make comments that I am so lucky I have a job and can get my hair and nails done whenever I want etc. 
Every few months someone asks to stay with me and then I am sucked into this same situation. No one ever offers to pay for anything. Its like im expected to foot everyones bill because Im in a better situation than them.  My friend just left my house today after 4  nights and I spent hundreds on her (dinners drinks wineries) cooked for her and treated her to get her nails done ( while she was there she added on a back massage and I didn’t know) . When I was surprised about the bill she said “ Ill pay for the tip”. This girl spent a total of $12 while here.  But had no problem telling me her dinner and drink orders, finding expensive restaurants on yelp and when we went grocery shopping I had to buy extra gluten free things (she doesn’t have celiac). Paid $7 for crackers and other ridiculous things. Her trip left a bad taste in my mouth. She texted me “thanks for everything” from the airport. I don’t want to do this ever again and I feel guilty feeling this way knowing I could totally afford it but I feel so used. Its not my fault I chose a different path in life. I want to stop this cycle but in a way that doesn’t offend anyone. I need advice.

I felt as if my mind was taken to a different realm and as if nothing in my life existed. Now, almost two months later, my mind keeps coming back to these thoughts and I am almost constantly experiencing this horribleness.

28801,8ko77s,throawayacc4reasons,How to deal with the aftermath of a limp noodle hookup and perform anxiety?,"Basically what happened is last night, after a party at this girl's place while everyone is dropping off , she asks me to stay. ""Nice"", I think as we head to a side room to seal the deal. Now, for a bit of context, we'd made out some times before, and had a ONS earlier this year in which... well, honesty, I hadn't been amazing, and things were a bit awkward afterwards. So we make out a bit, get pretty into it, and she wants to get right away, leglocks and all, except lil' Johnson down there decided he's having none of it. Total unresponsiveness, not even a half chub. We do foreplay for a while, but as its clear that the sword of omens isn't getting any bigger tonight, she just says ""leave it"", gets her clothes back on and head downstairs to clean the mess of the party. So we clean it, she calls me a cab back home, and I do the ride of shame.

Now, I want to make a few things clear.

This was not whiskey dick. I had a few sips, but not even enough to make cheeks blush, and I've been going sober for unrelated reasons.

Its not lack of attractiveness, she's hot and those thighs and booty do make me crazy.

Its not bad eating habits or lack of exercise, made my New Years resolution to do better on those fronts and have been actually following it, and I had not been overweight or anything even before that.

And lastly, it had been at least two days since my last fap.

What it has been is a pretty big blow to self\-esteem, and I don't understand where it came from, what's going with myself. Have not been able to get it up since last night, also, not even non\-sexually like when it feels as if my bladder is going to burst. Except, while this is has been the most extreme, getting laid is once every blue moon and with this troubles getting hard have been more the norm than exception with hook ups. I'm in my very early 20s, this stuff is not supposed to happen outta nowhere, right?

I realize this may also come as a hit to the gal's self image and would like to reassure that it got nothing to do with her, but I frankly don't even know how to face her.

Like I said, I'm getting pretty self\-conscious and don't really understand wtfs wrong with me. Does anybody else have any experience with this, or help or any piece advice to spare for a brother?"

Hope this is an appropriate place to ask this question.  

I have a really good long distance friend who constantly asks me if I’m OK or sending me texts checking in on me whenever we go for a few says without chatting, and even after I’ve said that I’m busy taking care of a lot of stuff in life. This is true since I got a lot of work pressure and other life events which I won’t go into. My other friends respect my space.  They check in once and wait for my response. This person just does it every 2-3 days and it really annoys me. Sometimes I just don’t want to socialize and just to be left alone so I can deal with my stuff. She told me that she does this to everyone and a friend actually asked her to not contact her [the friend] again because of this.  I feel like telling her straight out that I’m alright and I just need some space to sort my shit out. I just don’t want her to feel offended. I think this behavior, while sweet and caring, is just too needy for me. I understand that with long distance friendships, you can’t know if the person is ok unless you all text. But I feel like she’s not respecting my boundaries.  Like I check in on friends but I don’t do it every few days or so like this,  I understand people have lives.  Im not sure what to do or what to say to my friend without offending her.  

Please send me you wisdom and insights.  Thank you so much in advance!!!! 

- mildly annoyed chicken 

PS: I realize I may come across as prissy or ungrateful when I have people who care but sometimes I just want to be left on my own to recuperate and to do some self care.  I count myself lucky that I have people who care but you know, I think I should be allowed to have my own personal space.

28776,8kqw0o,jazzy_hippo,A woman hit my girlfriend tonight over something accidental and not sure the proper way to respond as a guy.,"So tonight, my girlfriend and I went downtown for a couple of drinks. It was a great evening, met up with some friends that I hadn’t seen in a while, and a great ending to a fun day. We called an Uber and were walking to the pick up point. Keep in mind, it’s a Saturday night so the streets were a little crowded; as we were walking down the sidewalk, there was a bit of a bottleneck where there was a line to get into a club. 

I was holding hands with my girlfriend and I guess a woman behind us was stepped in front of by us due to the bottleneck and her immediate reaction, without hesitation, was to SLAP MY GIRLFRIEND IN THE BACK OF THE NECK! 

We were both shocked... my girlfriend didn’t even know what she did wrong, not even realizing she apparently cut someone off. I turned around and said, “Excuse me, do not hit her,” in a stern voice but she was with a group of about 10 other girls, who all bowed up to us, backing up their friend. The girl who slapped my girlfriend gets in MY face and says, “Keep walking, BYE.. BYE.. BYE.. BYE..,” talking over anything more I was trying to say to her so I grabbed my girlfriend’s hand and flicked them off as we walked away (probably a little immature but I was so shocked and heated in the moment). 

Thinking back, there’s so many things I wish I could have done or said. I’m curious to see what the Reddit community thinks of the situation and what y’all would’ve done or what y’all think the right thing to do is. If it factors into the situation, me and my girlfriend are white and it was a group of about 10 black girls, and there was a group of rather large black guys right next to them that began to catch interest in what was going down. 

Idk, maybe I’m just still heated and need to vent.. but anyways, what do y’all think is the proper thing to do in that situation if it were you and your significant other?

TL;DR: My girlfriend was slapped in the back of the neck by a girl, backed up by all of her friends, over an accidental trip up and not sure how to respond."
21787,9jkyh5,pheoling,Neighbor makes noises every morning to get my dogs to bark,"I have an interesting neighbor to say the least, hes an old man and lives with his even older dying father. Hes always been a strange person, but generally friendly when we've seen each other or talked. Despite his friendly personality when we talk, he plays these passive aggressive games with me and my dogs and i don't know why. He keeps his windows open throughout most the year, the only time i see them closed are during the hottest days or summer or the coldest nights in winter. This makes it extremely easy for me or my dogs to hear him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few dogs so i let them outside multiple times a day to get some sun, play and do their ""business"". But almost every morning since we moved in about 2 years ago my neighbor has made these howling noises/variations of them throughout the morning. He will start making these weird barks going ""burk burk burk burk burk"" super loudly and in a rapid succession. It usually only last for a stint of 30 mins to an hour periodically. He changes up what he yelps out , sometimes its a literal ""WEEEEWOO"" like a siren over and over or just variations of odd phrases to purposely get my dogs barking. Hes even gone to the extent of silently saying their names to try and get them to come over to the fence to make his noises at them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its fall now so i like to keep my windows open at night and in the mornings to get fresh cool air in the house, but i am getting sick and tired of these games he plays. Every morning its him purposely making my dogs bark or doing other forms of noise in the backyard like ""taking out the trash"" over 15 times a day slamming the trash lid. Its odd he does this because he also ""sicks"" his dog on mine every time they bark for over a few minutes. I assume he didn't like the barking because of that, but Ive heard him tell his dog to ""go get em"" a few times in the morning which makes the dogs have a barking battle till i bring my dogs in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine trying to sleep in on a sunday to only be waken up by your neighbor whistling and barking at 7AM like a psychopath, which i think he might potentially be, My family hasn't confronted him because my mother once got into a conversation with him after bringing him sweets for a holiday (she felt bad for him being older and without a wife), but it turned weird real quick. She said he went on a rant somehow about how he was a hitman for hire before and killed a bunch of people in the war and thats what he was good at, like weird shit. My mom bailed and none of us have talked to him much since, i am not sure if hes delusional or a potential veteran. 

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing hes unstable i am afraid of a bad confrontation with him if i mention it and think he might just have some serious mental issues he can't help. What do you guys think i should do about this situation? All i know is im fucking tired of hearing 20 ""WEEEEEEEWWOOOOOOOO"" in the morning

8655,ckcixk,Nhetto,Girlfriend and her lingering exes,"I've been dating this girl for the past three months (let's call her Lauren)  now and I guess we are official, but not really because she prefers to not put a lable on it, as we are ""perfect like this"". I just went with it, because it was just a very vague and abrupt talk regarding our status, so it's okay with me aswell. But now maybe I'm realising it's for some different reasons. She has four exes that she talks on, basically, a daily basis, including the most recent one ( broke up two months before me ) that, I think she may have feelings for him. They didn't break up because they wanted to, it was because they had to for safety reasons. She  refuses to stop talking to any of them, even though she did admit that they want to get back together with her. Am I just insecure and I should let it all go or? Mind you, I am not controling at all, meaning Lauren can go out to clubs and bars with her friends and I don't mind whatsoever. I give her her space.

Lauren rarely ever talks about real things in person, only through texts. She tells me a lot of things. I trust her, but it is still bothering me. And take today for example. One of her exes came over today for tea to her place. There was Laura's family in the house, but I'm not sure if they were all together all the time. And we planned on meeting today, but she said she wasn't feeling well at all for the whole day. For context, she's been very sick for the past 5days. It made me upset that she was healthy enough for an ex, but not me. Am I in the wrong here? What should I do about it?"
36729,7s0b8y,aaron367,The friends I have vs. the friends I wish I had,"I am very different compared to the average person at my high school. I live in the South, and I go to a small school. 

I have friends, but sometimes I feel guilty after thinking that they’re not the ideal friend for me. Sometimes, they say stuff that I hate, and there isn’t anything I can say to stop them. And I know I can’t change people. 

But one of my friends, uses the N word regularly, knowing I don’t like it. Maybe it’s not fair to say she uses it regularly, but every time black people or racism is brought up into the conversation, she always says the same thing: “Black people and N****** aren’t the same thing. N****** tear shit up and stuff.” And I always respond with the same thing: “There are white trash people who do that? Do they piss you off the same?” And she always says, “No... but I’m *not* a racist.”  Very typical, and so disappointing. 

Then, there’s my other friend. She’s not that bad, but she still says some pretty crazy things:

1. She believes interracial relationships are against the Bible 

2. When we were talking about gay people on Disney channel, she said, “Disney channel is getting bad. I don’t want my future kids to watch that and become like that!”

So clearly, I have different views from my friends, and that shouldn’t always be a big deal. I would be friends with someone who had different political or religious views, as long as they were tasteful about it. Don’t be disrespectful, or hateful. And, it bothers me that they are this way. Believe me when I say this is just the surface of it, too. "
37770,7opjv0,Days_B,"My friend is getting under my skin, any advice?","My friend isn't a bad person, but a bit self centered maybe. I've recently been distancing myself for various reasons and she's been feeling lonely and not really doing all that much. She wants to do everything with me all the time, if I say I'm going to do something she won't leave me in peace she will ask loads of questions or ask for my input if I don't reply she just continues or asks if I'm ok, or she'll go do it herself and assume I want to talk. She says hi to me every morning and if I don't reply she says it again later and asks if I'm ok. I constantly have to deal with her petty issues which contradict themselves most of the time. She constantly wants to know how I'm feeling and if I give my reasons and they just aren't good enough essentially, she will tell me but it would be better so she knows what I'm going through. Most of the time if I say I haven't been up to much she will ask why I didn't talk if I was bored. She constantly asks if I want to do x sometime or x later, assuming I can just hang with her all the time. She wants me constantly and seems to think I need to give her my attention all the time. When I explain I have stuff to do I usually get a sob story at some point explaining she just wants to be a good friend and gets worried. She has a very much victim mentality despite being one of the most sheltered people I know (I could go off on that but for the sake of not making this too long I won't). I just can't do it anymore. The friendship is dead, I don't want to be so close anymore.

So any advice on how to distance from her or deal with her? The last thing I want is to hurt her feelings but it's getting to the point every little thing infuriates me.

Thanks."
17161,bed949,TheLastLBender,So I bought a car...,"I bought a Hyundai Elantra GT 2005 for $500 last Saturday. Not a great car but a good price for a highschooler who spent 2.5 months saving.

32568,85modc,dictatorburger,Student teaching a High School class. Need advice on grading.,"I'm going to try and explain both sides as well as I can.

So, basically my high school has been going down the drain. We're short an estimated dozen of teachers and that includes one of our music classes. Now, music classes are pretty simple. All you really do is show up, bring your instrument, and play. Typically, classes last an hour, but since we don't have an official teacher, us upperclassmen have been leading the class and we've decided to appeal to the other students by allowing them the last half or quarter of class to study or chill.

1st semester was fine. Everyone participated. But now, we usually only have about 7 of the 12 students participating.

On one hand, it's still a class, we're supposed to have a concert in two months, and we're supposed to have a teacher come in to help out next month. Personally, I want to somewhat prepare them for when this teacher and this concert arrives. I don't want some stranger walking in and going off on us for not trying hard enough. I'd at least like us to be halfway decent.

On another hand, I understand it almost seems pointless to play. Without a real teacher, we're not anywhere near being capable of playing decently at a concert. No one seems to be able to listen to one another and stay together. As students, us upperclassmen aren't well-equipped with the skills to help us play together like our teacher last year was.

So... here's our solution right now to ""encourage"" others to play:
Grading participation. It's something our teacher did all the time previous years. Our co-teacher (substitute, basically) promised they'd enter the grades we gave them for their participation. We announced this to the class and, honestly, this didn't irk anyone who hadn't previously been participating to join in. However, grades haven't been entered yet, so I'm guessing they don't believe us.

When I told another upperclassmen who hasn't been participating much about this idea, they expressed their disapproval and angrily remarked that the class was worthless and they didn't care about failing anyways.

In one sense, I don't want to be blamed for failing some kids. I want everyone to succeed. In another sense, I don't believe anyone deserves to excel if they don't participate.

So, I guess my question is; are we few upperclassmen justified in failing other students? Or is there another way we should be going about this? All insight is welcome."

17606,bc5rj3,raqueldo,My (adopted) daughter physically abuses my (adopted) son.,"I have two children, both of which are adopted. One is a toddler whom I adopted shortly after he was born and the other is much older who I just adopted recently. Right after introducing them to each-other, I noticed some awkward tension between them, but I thought that this must be normal; they need time to get to know each other.

However, I have since caught my older daughter physically abusing my toddler multiple times now. She has said that she is going to “eat him one day” and other strange and disturbing comments, but gives no explanation. She seems to be angry most of the time. The adoption center gave me no description of any mental illnesses, and she was perfectly fine at first, but she has quickly turned into a monster around my son.

I try to talk to my daughter and explain that this behavior is never acceptable, but its hard to tell if she’s actually listening. Her behavior has not improved after the constant lectures. My toddler is shy and soft spoken, and won’t speak too much about how his sister is treating him, which is disappointing.

For now, I have them separated on the worse days. Today I have made them not separated from each other because I don’t want them to hate each other.

I just want them to get along.

I am concerned for my daughter’s mental state and my son’s safety. What should I do about this? How can I turn this into a happy family? I feel like a horrible mother. My husband is also very supportive, but unfortunately he isn’t around much."

Jumping to 24.10.2016 i came home earlyer from school and went to play CSGO, was waiting my friend to come so we can play together, sudenly my pc shuts down, i thought that was weird but whatever i turned it back on and it shuts down again, so i thought eh im gonna go to sleep but first to the bathroom, I open the door of my room and at the end of the hall i see the back of my house burning, the chimney was burning, if you are confused i should mention my parrents run private retirement home for elders in our house, so anyway in flip flops, shirt and jeans i run down screaming the house is burning and saw neighbours helping to pull people out, i run back in the house to get the phone to call my dad and as I was calling he came and didnt know what to do, fire deparment came 2 hours later and basically 80% of our house was gone. We drove the elders to my aunts house and settled them there, in the end it ended up the fire was planted, of course no one found out by who, the detectives came and were cracking jokes, the guy who i was out with in the bar two weeks ago, walked passed me, looked at me, took the picture of house got in the car and went away, few days later i come back from school and dad tells me he is suing him, he wanted me to talk shit to her but i refused because i didnt want to get involved,  I sleept on a floor until february 2017. We built everything back.

14.05.2017 I graduated and since my parrents wanted from me to go to college i decided to go into economics so i can run the bussiness when i finish college, my mother just fucking kept crying how if i dont make it into college she would feel like she hasnt acomplised anything and she would feel like a bad mother etc..she was applying presure on to me so i decided not to hear from her until i get into college. Anyway, i get into college, and everythings great , my mother again keeps telling me how she hasnt seen me almost a year and wants to see me, so i said great, me and my girlfriend are going to grandpa to sea side (her father) so come, she said i cant i started german course she has to go she cant miss it out so i said fine. 

Somehow, she managed to go for 2 weeks to Canada since family member had a weeding, I still said fine, sure..okay.
I started college and its freaking brutal, its not hard the problem is I didnt get used to studying so much for such short time. I still decided I am not giving up because I wouldnt be able to forgive myself If i did. I came home, failed a lot of classes still said I am not giving up until the end. My mother comes from germany, 2 houses away from me, I ask her when can I see you, she answers, 'When you really need me then call me', I again asked cmon we didnt see in such long time she says 'I'll let you know I'm busy' I said okay. This was like 29.12.2017 something like that and I had to go back to college so i can pay the rent for the appartment and college and wrote to her again that I have to go when can I see her, she fucking calls me and starts talking shit to me that i am an idiot, ape all kind of stuff and when i tried to defend myself she wouldnt let me so i just fucking snaped and told her fine dont call me anymore and dont ever fucking cry to me that you didnt see me over a year and hang up, i let down few tears and got back to normal me.

Before 29.12 I meet this girl thats great and we meet 2 times but we decided to cut it off before she falls in love and im taken, I didnt cheat my gf this girl was testing me but i said No. This shit got to me and well i thought about breaking up for few months because everything was going down, few days before new year we break up, new year comes i get drunk, we get back together i wake up and actually feel like it was a mistake but couldnt do it to her for second time..

I told her my feelings and basically it all ended up my fault because i was cold etc, so i said sure okay, fine I'll try once more if it doesnt work we are done.
08.01.2018 that girl started messaging me again wanting to see me so bad so i said okay, we meet and I told her we should end this now because I started again with my girl and I guess its my fault and will try more, she cried, i didnt know what to do, she got a boyfriend now and I am glad for her she deserves someome great.

All this..all of this, got me to the point that I dont feel like living anymore, i got no courage, I cant get out of my comfort zone because Im scared i might regret it and its gotten to the point that i am thinking about suicide few times a day, especially in college.

Any comment is appreciated..thanks i guess for reading and letting me take it all out.."
3603,datqbr,the_book_of_yo_mamma,Am I just getting old?,"I've moved from a country town that I'd grown up in to the city about two years ago and my life has just become a six day routine of wake up at 5.30, work, get home from about 6ish on wards, order take away, shower and sleep or I am working away for a week at a time. My physical and mental health is actually starting to pay for it. I feel tired and really just don't give a fuck about a lot of things like I used to.

&amp;#x200B;

How do people with that sort of routine find time/motivation to do anything?  Cook, clean, find new people to even hang out with. All that stuff? I had a couple of days off this weekend and I've hardly even left my room."

33834,81xmw9,C0nfuzzled,Convincing my parents to let me purchase Desktop.,"Hello everyone! At first glance this may seem like a very stupid question but as of now I have no where to turn and was wondering if you guys can help me.

Ever since 8th grade I have always wanted to build a computer for gaming and other online purposes. Throughout high school my parents always said they wouldn't allow it and it was understood, I focused on my studies and they were correct to not spend money on something I wanted.

Before I get into anything I just want to comment on how fair my parents are. I am 19 at the moment and commute to college and involving going out or spending my own money they are pretty ok with it. Regarding household duties I consistently help out and contribute because I feel it is right.  

Furthermore, I graduated with 4 year honors and all acceptances to universities with a academic award at my graduation. The summer going into first year college I went to work in a factory which I absolutely hated the shift and the job involving 6am to 2:30pm in consistent heat and labor. I didn't care to much because it was only for 2 months and I took home around 2500 dollars which was amazing. Moving along I came to first year and my parents still said to me its not a good idea because it will distract me from my studies and they were right. I was still upset but I let it go and just focused on other hobbies. 

Moving along to last summer I basically had to work construction due to my dad's request. All the jobs I applied for rejected me and he only would let me switch jobs if there was something in my field which for me is very rare. He made a promise to me that this job would only be for 1 summer and regardless of arguing I worked there for 4 months. The pay was good for a student but 50 hour work weeks were kinda hard for me but I kept my mouth shut and did my job and took home a good amount of cash in 4 months.

In present day I still would like to purchase my computer but It is just so hard to convince them. I am 19 years old second year of university and have enough money to fund the whole project myself. However every time I bring it up to them it gets brushed off and not taken any interest. When the argument escalates my parents argue that I dont pay rent and that as-long as I am under there roof they have authority which makes me furious. My friends have told me to just do it and pay the consequences but this really upsets me in the fact that my parents will always be mad and any drop in academic grades they will blame on my passion for gaming.

The big reason why I am frustrated is that my brother has a setup similar to one I want except he has a gaming laptop instead of computer and my parents just leave it alone. I understand this is very stupid and immature but I would just like to ask your guys take on it. I contribute more then enough of my efforts into helping my family around the house and other then this there amazing and some of the most fair people I have ever met. As of now my parents just purchased a laptop for school and I know people may say I am greedy but the system has low specs and doesn't run anything. The only video games I play are old mobas and other low spec games that have trouble running on a laptop that is 5 years old and elevated.

If anyone can help that would be amazing, I know this is stupid I just don't know where else to turn.

Maybe I've accepted it
Maybe it's been too long
It's tied to me like the ink of a tattoo
Didn't I let go when I saw you'd moved on?

Why do you stay
In the images that play
Why do you still haunt me
With the memory of our days

Sometimes your not there
And I'll almost seem to forget
But then I see the colour red
And suddenly I'm in your arms, your bed

Do you feel the same way
Are you faking this content?
I was sure i meant more to you
Than to block me from your heart, your head

Well if I don't then that's ok
It's justly my own stained regret
I know in my heart you'll always be
The best thing I have ever met

The best thing I have ever met."
32995,84dow0,Negan1995,"Intimate friendship with girl, is this normal what are the risks?","  I've (22M) been close friends with this girl (25F) for about 4 months. Met her about a year ago when she was dating my cousin. Over the course of the last few months we got closer and closer emotionally, which is normal for my female friendships I just have a higher emotional comfort around them. 

  We got comfortable staying over at each others places and sharing a bed. After a few nights like this we ended up hooking up and having sex. When we had the sex talk a few days later she expressed that she didn't want to date anyone right now and that me being her ex's cousin (practically brothers) wasn't something she felt overly comfortable with. For a few weeks I was a bit hurt about the situation, I'm a very physical person so the sex got me a bit attached in that way. 

  About 2 weeks ago I started getting the sense that she was talking with another guy, and was intimate with him at least in the same way me and her are. We began talking a bit less and it just seemed a bit more distant, but I undestood maybe she wanted to give some space after I expressed interest in her.

  In an attempt to get close again I decided to ask her to be my wingman, as I figured if me and her won't work out romantically. I might as well have her help me, since I still want her to be a big part of my life. 
  
 She liked the idea and we plan on trying out the wingman situation this friday. I guess what is very different about our friendship is that we still have some level of physical intimacy even though we aren't pursuing anything together, the sex was a one time thing, but about once a week I will still stay over at her place and we will cuddle, pretty intimately at that. Holding each other in our arms, holding hands, spooning, etc. 

 For most guys this would be awful, since no sex. But I'm a huge cuddler and it makes me feel close to people, I'm a bit feminine in that respect as I prefer it over sex anyway. It's more meaningful to me, even as friends. At this point I'm not hung up on her emotionally, our friendship is fine, we are back to talking a good amount, she gives me cuddles whenever I want, and she wants to be my wingman. To me it seems like our friendship has hit a pretty good spot, but is any of this normal or healthy? I've never had a friendship quite like this."
22751,9g51fx,noideaedion,How can I make a positive impact on this kid's life? (Am I exaggerating?),"So I'm 17, and there's this 12 years old kid in school who started following me around. It happened a few months ago after I was sent into the ""After School"" (which is basically just a classroom + the school yard) as a punishment of sorts, where he happens to be every day.

He's been following me around during breaks, and during the after school he's almost always with me, asking me to play with him etc. He even made me a stone necklace and gave it to me. Once he called me his ""young father figure"". He's your typical super childish, dorky kid with a few friends. I really don't mind him at all as I've kinda grown fond of him.

Now, the thing is, he once actually decided to tell me a bit about his personal life. It's safe to say the kid's got a lot of family problems. I don't want to share too much: Lived half his life in an orphanage, his dad adopted him when he was 7 or 8, his mum left etc etc. I don't feel comfortable going into detail.

All in all, I guess I'm asking for advice. The kid has family problems and seems to look up to me in a way. I just want to know how I can make a positive impact on his life."
27421,8s4kgh,ovra360,How do I stop being so sad about never having found love?,"I'm a 25 year old straight woman, and for the last several years I've struggled a lot with the fact that I've never had much luck with romantic relationships. I've had a handful of shorter term situations (ranging from hooking up once or twice to casually dating for a couple of months) which ended for one reason or another, and one 10 month long relationship (we ended up being better off as friends). But, I've never been in love, not even close. I worry so much that there is something wrong with me preventing me from making that kind of connection, or that for some reason no one seems to want me. I feel that I'm missing out on an essential human experience and I long for it so much. Despite having lots of close friends and family, I'm very lonely in this respect. I know that I'm still young, but it seems like everyone I know is or at least has been in a serious relationship. I don't dwell on it too much, i spend a lot of time with my friends, job, hobbies, etc, but it's like this constant nagging sadness that catches up with me any time I'm not occupied with something. Has anyone had any experience with this, and if so, do you have any tips for being more ok with being single?"

15368,bn89na,Chaomayhem,I'm worried about my online friend.,"This is a crosspost. Didn't get any feedback in the other sub. I still don't know if this is the right subreddit but I need to get this off my chest. So there's this online friend I have been talking to regularly for the past year. She's very active on Reddit, usually posting everyday. She hasn't posted in a month though and I'm pretty worried. She has taken a break from Reddit before but she let me know she was taking a break that time. I'm worried because she mentioned before she has a chronic illness. Not sure what it was specifically but she has told me she could end up in the hospital without warning. 

I have only talked to her on Reddit and don't have any more contact information for her. So it's really hard to know whether she's alright or not. She did get locked out of her old account, but if that happened again with her new one I would think I would have gotten a message from her like last time. 

Given the circumstances, I know there's probably not much I can do at all. I just needed to get this off my chest though because I'm very worried about her. Is there anything at all I could do?"
37525,7pfg89,JessTheMustache,Best friend could end up ruining her future?,"Hi! So I thought I’d post here (not very good at finding the right subreddits, lol) because I need some advice. 

I (17F) currently am doing an apprenticeship full time. My best friend of 5 years (also 17F) has left school and doesn’t work. I have tried helping her find a job and encouraged her to go back to college, but she won’t have any of it. She has her GCSE’s and that is all, and at the moment doesn’t do anything except stay at home. She doesn’t look for anything and will pick faults in stuff I try to find for her, because I can’t make her apply for them.

I worry, because in a few months she will be 18 and education won’t be free for her. If she’s earning no money she can’t pay for her courses and it seems she doesn’t want to work. She sponges off of her parents and I know she is quite a lazy person no matter how close we are. We used to have plans of moving in together and being roommates, etc. But I cannot afford to pay for both people, which she knows. I don’t want to see her end up in bad circumstances in the future, with no job, no qualifications and no Home either. 

Does anyone have any advice as to how I can help her any more or how she can help herself? Thanks

6652,cu8i95,allsmilesreally,Nervous about new friends after losing my old ones.,"F20 here. I never had friends growing up. When I was around 15 I made a bunch of friends online that were all into the same obscure TV show I was. These guys were my best friends. I wrote fanfics for them, ordered food and gifts for them, even flew across the country to see them. Last year they finally came clean and told me they’d hated me the whole time and only put up with me to be nice, in hopes I’d eventually grow apart from them. It messed me up bad.

Now I finally have two new friends online. Our relationship is much more even, but I’m starting to get nervous. I was supposed to meet one friend at a convention only for her to have a medical emergency last minute (don’t worry, I know she’s a real 20-something girl, I’ve FaceTimed her). Tonight one of them was starving, so I ordered her food. I just feel like I’m falling into a trap and any second now someone will pull the rug out and admit it was just a set up to see what they could get out of me.

I don’t want to bother my friends with this; they’re great and it’s not their fault that I’m repeating myself. I guess I just need advice on how to avoid the same cycle of heartbreak. Thanks in advance :)"

I literally feel helpless. My grandmother, who is 85 years old, has been very sick lately. Always feeling like she's going to vomit, bad diarrhea, constant headache, and as shaky as I've ever seen someone. She also sleeps all day which is not like her. I've been going to check on her and bring her soup and liquids before and after work every day for the last week or so, and she seems to be getting worse.

No matter how much I try to convince her, she refuses to go to the doctor and it's wearing on me emotionally. I don't know what to do. My family members have also tried talking her into going to the doctor's and she refuses. She will not go to the doctor and it is FRUSTRATING. I don't even know why I'm posting here other than I'm desperate. I don't want to lose her. I wish she would be more honest about how she's feeling. Anyone been in a similar situation? Any words of advice? Anything? :(

If nothing else, thank you for hearing me out."

30457,8defxp,Charlie__Foxtrot,"Looking for help with procrastination, or something similar","Procrastination, work ethic, maybe some brand of sedentary-ness, whatever it is, I've had problems doing the work that I ought to pretty much since I had work to do, definitely since the beginning of highschool (~12 years old). When work has been easy, I've been more able to keep up (a revelation, I'm sure), but a few times in the past, when the going got tough, my academic performance has suffered immensely as a result of it. 

I hesitate to call it procrastination because, although the symptoms are similar, there seem to be a variety of mechanisms at play, all compounding one another to the same effect. This is likely a reason that its been so elusive when it comes to treatment and/or help.  

It's not just work in the academic sense that it fouls up, but also in a more general sense. I don't think anyone particularly enjoys doing admin, but for me (I think) it's particularly difficult. I also procrastinate on things that I actively enjoy doing, like playing video games, where instead I'll just keep browsing reddit, facebook, twitter, youtube, or just daydream. It feels like I think 'Hey, I should do [an activity]' and then I just *don't*.

Over the years, I've generally tried to solve my problem by talking to people, from my close family, to learning support staff at school, to therapists (cognitive behavioural and regular), to psychologists, and needless to say none of those efforts were successful, and not for lack of trying on their parts.  

What I'm looking for here is somewhere to start, a lead to follow. It seems like I've exhausted all the potential avenues I know of, and I need somewhere else to start looking. If you want to offer your own advice, please think about how likely I am to have heard and tried it before, and how likely it is to work for me if I haven't. If this post is analogous to a google search, I'm looking for links, not the answer it shows from the most relevant source.

I'm a young male, studying engineering in England. I'm a high functioning aspie, and I have heard of and dismissed PDA.

tl;dr I have trouble getting myself to do the things I should, even if I like to do them, and I don't know what to do about it.

34431,7zww1y,StraightMirror,"I'm an angry self centered child, and I want my life to be less painful","I've always hated myself. My parents were typical meth head hillbillies and were too fucked up to give a shit and I developed no sense of self worth. I went through school with shit grades and no friends until the end of high school where I branched out for the first time and fucked it up as bad as possible.  
  
I had just started hanging out with a few kids maybe 6 months earlier, we pretty much bonded over drugs exclusively. I developed a really painful crush on a girl (I say painful because it was my first real crush and I think it triggered a lot of mental health issues that turned me obsessive, I felt like if I could make a relationship work it would validate me and undo the years of being ostracized). I told my friends about it and was trying to figure out how to approach her, but they wound up telling alot of people and a boy she was involved with (i didnt know at the time, I think they kept it private) went on a rampage telling everyone about my pathetic attempt and how he was hooking up with this girl that I liked.  
  
I became the laughing stock of my town (which is super small in the middle of no where so there was no escape from it) people I previously had good relationships with before began mocking me for being friendless/a virgin. I felt so worthless, I had no parents to talk too, no friends who would address the matter without putting me down.  
  
I thought I was over it, the intense self hatred motivated me through college and my job, I finally had something to be proud of.  But my relationships are still toxic and I still hate myself. Early on in college I was obsessed with meeting girls. I was able to meet some but I always wound up blowing it. I had no social skills, no empathy, and no strategy beyond asking very traditionally for dates. When they said they'd rather be friends I would accept it but still be a toxic prick who said mean things to put them down, I was so insecure and would seethe with anger whenever we spoke. It leaked out as rude comments until it pushed them away.  
  
Eventually I just stopped trying all together, school  and work were easier, chasing money was so simple compared to trying to build relationships or friendships. I just graduated and have a great job on the west coast making lots of money but I'm as miserable as ever. Im ruthlessly bitter and spiteful, Its great for my job but every night I go home to nothing and no one. Im happy at work so I work 7 days a week, but I'm going to get old eventually and I can feel years of compressed loneliness building up.
  
I think I've matured a bit, at least enough to feel shame over the things I did to people and the lack of respect I had for women. But its not helping, now I not only feel anger but intense humiliation and I have bouts of cringing at my former self where I have to hit myself on the head to make the memory go away. I dont know what to do, I feel like I get angrier by the minute and Im so absolutely alone, I dont want to be this way and I dont want to hurt everyone I talk too. How do I change?"

11844,c4h8n1,totalthrowaway696969,"[Serious] My father, who was violently abusive for 3 years I was in middle school, recently admitted he was ""proud"" of what he'd done because of the men my brother and I grew into.","I'll be turning 32 this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

To keep the story short, he was dating a woman who was telling him we were stealing her jewelry and destroying her stuff, so he'd by her brand new shit and beat the absolute fucking hell-fire out of my little brother and I. She had him convinced we were gonna be serial killers someday, and he beat us just about every day. For three straight years.  


He eventually learned that she was cheating on him, and had been taking him for a ride this whole time. He'd tried to make it up to us. He'd tried to make it right. He'd said he was sorry.  


Things weren't great growing up after. He didn't hit us, but he was still verbally abusive. He's broken damn near every promise he's ever made, and he's manipulated me out of money on several occasions (totaling thousands of dollars currently), he's put me, my hobbies, and even my friends down on occasion, to the point where now I pretty much don't do anything but work and sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

But my brother got married recently, and I'm happy for him. A couple months ago, things were kinda rocky for the two of them. It's private and unrelated, but I sat down with my step-mother (who's thankfully a sweet lady) and my father to see if the 3 of us could do anything to help. During the conversation, he expressed confusion about why bro would be upset with him, and I said ""Well you weren't exactly sunshine and roses to grow up with"" to which he replied ""Damn right, and glad I did: look how you two turned out!""  


That happened about 3 months ago. I've been having nightmares from some of his more 'intense' sessions. Every time he even crosses my mind, I start getting uncontrollably furious. I plan to see a therapist, and I've been avoiding him and  keeping a lid on this anger as best as I can. I know that, as cathartic as it would be to headbutt his nose to the back of his skull, violence will only make things harder for everyone in the family. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm gonna have to meet with him face to face either tomorrow or tuesday (he's a mechanic, and my oil's due). And my step-mother mentioned that he wasn't happy that I ""forgot"" to say anything to him for father's day. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I already have an idea of what I'm going to say, but I've played the scene in my head over and over again: knowing him the way I do, violence seems likely. I ***need*** to confront him about this, but how can I handle this without it turning into a fight?"

We only now have just started talking again.  He knew/knows I have feelings but told me four years ago he ""may not ever be able to give me romantic attention"" which broke me because he doesn't ever seem happy with whomever he's with.  

I observe that we are now far more matured than when we were 23/24 because our conversations are more refined, but it's hard not to mentally acknowledge these feelings when there's sexual tension/friendly flirting at play. I know my role but mentally still pine and have resolved that I'm not ""her"" for him.

He seems enthusiastic to keep in contact now, yet there's a nagging feeling in me.   Any advice?﻿

33018,84awd1,AuthenticCity,Need advice about how to fix this rollercoaster ride of a friendship,"**TL;DR** The person I love most calls me one of her ""best friends"" but is hot and cold and it's driving me insane

For some backstory that may help: I'm a girl, I have social anxiety disorder, I already go to therapy, I am attracted to her but its too complicated, and yes I recognize my need for more friends but I absolutely suck at  keeping them and feel like I've given up on hoping to make more. 

For this part I don't even know where to start. My friendship with her has been up and down from the start. The second I met her 3 years ago I thought she was so cool, but kept my distance because I could tell she thought I was kind of weird. I was intimidated by her and we didn't talk until we were on a trip together last summer. She alternated between clingy and guarded towards me the entire trip, but towards the end I held her while she was crying. She avoided me for a while after which broke my heart, but a week after we got back home she said what I'd done was exactly what she needed and proceeded to text me everyday since, confiding in me about the big and small, crying in my arms a couple times, and eventually calling me one of her best friends. 

(And yes, we text everyday but I try to only text if I have something to say and leave the conversation on a high, whereas she's the one that will ruin it by trying to text me until the staleness is unbearable and it's just a lot of pressure sometimes because she has so many friends and though she told me I'm in the top 6 I still have a lot to compete with.)

The problem: I can't feel secure and satisfied in this friendship no matter how hard I try. In many little ways she shows a line drawn in the sand between me and the other people she's close to, and overall I feel like she's more critical of me simply because *I'm not them.* Her favorite people complain to me that she's too affectionate, too clingy, texts too much, gives too many gifts, etc; what she does for others I do for her even though she's not invested in me like she is in them and a part of me wishes she would give me a chance because I feel I could appreciate what they don't. The way she treats them I treat her and the way they treat her she treats me and it's so ironic. She both tries constantly to impress me and is annoyed by my attention and I can never find the right balance. She keeps talking about how much she likes quality time, and clearly her ""best friends"" aren't interested but when I try to suggest something fun we could do together she is reluctant and dodges making plans. I wanted to show her that I'm interesting but she's not impressed by my interests and talents. She likes to be known on a deep level, and I can sense her emotions but not as naturally as her best friend/sort of crush can so she doesn't really value that and I feel like a failure. I always want to be the one to be the hero that saves her day and I hate that I think like that, I feel inferior to her favorites often, it's like if I were the only one or number 1 that I wouldn't have to constantly prove my worth. I wish we had a ""thing"" of our own to bond on so I wouldn't keep comparing myself to them but she never lets us have a thing that is ours for too long. She also doesn't remember things I like or ask about what I may be going through, but that may be because I'm three years older. I always want to talk to her but after it's been good for a while and we seem to be getting closer she'll have a day where it seems like she's fed up with me, so I give her space and it's back to the drawing board but it makes me so anxious that she needs space and a reset from me that she never needs from the favorites. We text everyday, but in person-and often in text too-I'm usually too afraid of saying something annoying to say anything at all, so it's harder for her to connect with me, and she also doesn't seem motivated to anyway, she usually ignores me in groups if one of her favorites are part of the conversation. She started us texting I love you to each other, but now if I text it first she often ignores it-if I say it aloud she ignores me-but still makes it seem that the love isn't reciprocated even when she does text it back by saying ""Love you!"" Instead of ""I love you."" I can be too focused on being perfect, often missing things or interpreting everything as a sign she hates me and feeling like I'm letting her down and I just wish I could ask her ""WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME"" but she might not even know.

On one retreat a couple months ago she was so sleep deprived that she lost all inhibitions and started treating me like I was the best thing to walk the earth. It was hilarious, but it was nice to have her want me around all the time and me not even have to try so hard. But then the next day she was so cold to me and I don't know if I messed up or if she was just back to normal. A part of me always wonders what it would be like if she was that open, loving person toward me all the time and I often wonder what happened. 

One of her favorite people told me ""You chose her...but she has to also choose you."" It's the classic You're Not Your Favorite Person's Favorite Person ""problem"" that I guess we all deal with at some point. I feel myself getting possessive and obsessive and all the things I promised myself I wouldn't be, and I'm trying so hard to hide it from her but fear she can tell subconsciously. 

People tell me to stop being friends with her all of the time, but one I don't want to stop and two this is something I need to get to the bottom of because so far my friendships tend to turn to this direction and I want to know why. I feel like I'm the toxic person and I just want to learn how to turn this friendship around."
24550,97hf3r,MedicalEmployee,Life is falling apart. Alone and scared.,"I'm typing this on my phone so please don't mind the formatting.  

I'm a 29 year old African woman who moved to Germany two years ago to try and start a new life and escape the prosecution of my former society because I've left my religion (Islam) and refused to conform to their way of living and being forced to marry a cousin and live the rest of my life as a slave to my husband and a baby making machine. 

What's kind of relevant to my situation now is that I was raped when I was six years old, beaten by my father (and my brothers too, not just me), we have a variety of mental illnesses in the family along with sleep disturbances. I was  diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was 17 but I didn't take medications for it since my parents didn't know that I went to the psychiatrist and wouldn't pay for the medication because they believe that my problems are caused by my weak belief in God, my lack of prayer, and my bad behaviour. And they would take me to a sheikh and have him read Qur'an for me and try to exorcise my demons instead.  

It was manageable over the years and I had no big problems except for my incredibly irregular sleep because of almost daily episodes of sleep paralysis and exploding head syndrome. but since I was living at home and my mother would take care to wake me up to go to school/work on time, I managed to graduate and work my way out of there and had a somewhat normal life (ignoring the voices and not having too much stress about rent and food and such basics).  

Now that I'm living on my own and have to work everyday to be able to afford rent and food and most importantly staying here. My very low paying job is kind of the most important thing to me. I don't have many friends and I don't have any time to see them. I barely find time to reply to my mother's messages telling her I'm fine and alive. I struggle at the end of each month to be able to pay next month's rent. Work is hard and I have to also go to school and learn everything in German. My living situation isn't very good but it's cheap.  The co-workers aren't very understanding and complain that I am too silent and withdrawan so I always get scolded by my boss that I'm not a team player and that the colleagues don't think I'm friendly enough. I didn't worry about it too much. I don't know why. I don't care what they think of me.  

Ever since I started working here my mental state has been in steady decline. I don't know which caused which but the voices has been getting louder and I can't sleep because of it. Now it's evolved to visual hallucinations and physical health decline. I have lost a lot of weight since I have no energy to cook or go buy food. I feel extremely bad and weird all the time and if I get more than 3 hours of sleep at night that would be the highlight of my day.  

I went to a doctor and told him I can't sleep. Before he asked me what was wrong the first thing he said was ""I'm not going to give you any medications"", which was fine since all I needed was a referral to the sleep lab without which I couldn't get the appointment. I also went to a psychiatrist and she wrote me some medications but I stopped taking them. Since I read about them and how they have horrible side effects to my heart. It gave me tachycardia and I started to panic even more so I was too afraid to take any more or go back to the doctor. Mostly because I don't have time to wait 3 months for another appointment. And after waiting three months for my appointment with the sleep lab they told me they need to rule out sleep apnea so they need me to see an ent doctor and then a month later I will have another appointment.  

In the meantime I am oversleeping everyday and showing up to work late, can't concentrate and make a lot of mistakes, I'm often too tired so I call in sick way more often than they think I should. My boss is getting impatient with me even though I told him that I'm not feeling very well currently and I am trying to get help. He's not the most understanding person in the world and it doesn't help that I can't express myself very well in German or even get emotional so that he would believe me, he thinks I'm just lazy. Which causes me to get even more stressed out and scared.  I don't know how long I can go on like this or what to do now. If I lose this job it's back to Africa for me. I'd rather die than go back there. I'm so lost and my mind is just in chaos. I don't know what I should do now. :("

26169,8yxuxk,PistolPerfect,I have a a fear and it's ruining me,"Hey, Reddit.

Okay, so I have talked to various people and even mentioned it to a therapist once... and I just want to know what advice you might be able to give me. Honestly, I've been able to curb it for a bit, but dammit, it's coming back. Hard.

I have what many would call an irrational fear. Some people are afraid of suffocation, or ghosts, or electrocution or some other rather understandable things. I want to bring my fear out and share it with people as sort of a plea to see how some may go about rationalizing my issue. 

I guess there really is no starting/ending point to any of this... so I will just go ahead and explain what is happening. I have a disturbing, and unconditional fear of someone hiding in my house. I am a 19 year old male, living with my parents as to work and save during college. I have always been somewhat interested in horror flicks and horror stories and murder-mysteries and shit like that; but it's all been fun personal interests. Nothing too serious. However, I believe that has stemmed into something much worse - this fear that I have acquired. 

If I could put a starting point on it, the earliest I can think of was when I was about 7 or so, and my mother was reading me a story before bed (probably Clifford or some shit), and we heard a very loud thump/bang in the basement. Our basement being unfinished, my parents thought it was a busted window or a wood finish breaking or something similar. We got downstairs, and there was nothing. No broken anything, no sign of anyone/anything. Just emptiness. I'm not one to believe in ghosts, which is why I thought it was something much more. An actual person. 

Fast forward to today... I still get massive adrenaline rushes whenever I turn my back in my home. I still hear bumps and smashes and bangs - but I'm always afraid it's my mind playing tricks on me. I hallucinate people standing in doorways and someone peering through windows and shadows moving behind doorways and down hallways.

Everyone just says I have an overactive imagination and that my ""love of horror"" has caused stupid little imaginative bursts... and that I am simply seeing what I want to see. Well, why the fuck would I wanna see someone intruding into my home?

I still have these fears to this day. I still get the adrenaline rushes. I still hear shit. See shit. And I still fear for my safety, IN MY OWN HOME. 

I understand this is a weird thing to admit and ask for advice about... but I just wanna know, what would you do?

tl;dr - I have a massive fear of someone stalking me/hiding in my own home and even hallucinate seeing people/figures in windows/doorways/hallways/etc. It is driving me mad. I'm desperate. 

I'm shaking as I write this in my own room as the house is empty. No one else is here - supposedly. "

39345,7k0fn7,Gandalf-the-Bae,Mom's abusive boyfriend put tracking device in her purse but she's making me out to be the bad guy.,"A general background: I [23F] was raised in an Italian immigrant, super Catholic household in which the parents ""own"" their children--even when they're adults--and have ultimate say over everything, from your appearance to your religious and political beliefs. For years, my relationship with my mother has become increasingly strained. I am 23 years old and she still tries to exert total control over every aspect of my life, and it has been extremely detrimental to my mental health over the years. My family has a group mindset, so it's basically all of them against me.

My mom, grandmother, uncle, and I all live on separate floors of our triple-decker apartment home in Boston. My boyfriend and I are recent college graduates and live on the third floor, paying my family relatively cheap rent. There has been a great deal of tension since we moved up here. My mom keeps wavering between playing the ""landlord"" and ""parent"" card, choosing whichever one suits her reality best in the moment. In one instance, my boyfriend grew frustrated at her for trying to exert control over HIM and she literally told him, ""I am your elder. I'm above you.""

Things have gotten progressively worse in the past year. My mom met her new boyfriend last January and he moved into our house a month or two later. I was still living downstairs in my mom's apartment at the time, and she didn't even run it by me when this guy she barely knew started staying over our apartment every day. He started moving his stuff in, and I was getting shifted out of my own apartment for a guy she just met.

I have a RIDICULOUS amount of issues with her boyfriend. From the very beginning, I noticed that he was incredibly insecure, controlling, and manipulative. Here are some highlights:

* He would always make disparaging comments about my deceased father, who my mom divorced nearly 2 decades ago.
* He demanded access to my mom's social media accounts and constantly monitors and tries to control her activity. One time he logged onto her Facebook and deleted a bunch of people that he didn't like.
* He uses money as a control method and always buys my mom expensive things, mostly technology (GPS enabled technology. Hm.)
* He gets excessively jealous when she talks to anyone and demands her attention. One time he was at his condo and my mom was on the phone, so he called her house phone (which she was talking on) and she didn't pick up. So I heard him call her cell phone. Then I heard the Facetime tone. Then the text tone. Then the cell phone again. Then I heard my mom switch the house phone line to him, ensuing in an argument. He got mad at her for not picking up and when she told him that she was talking to a friend, angrily asked why she needs to talk to her. Yup.
* He gets angry when she goes to the gym, which is pretty essential for her because she's overweight and wants to get healthy.''

He also tries to exert control over our entire household. My mom includes him in ""family meetings"" AKA interventions with me and my boyfriend, and he tries to run those conversations. She lets him have say over everything from the bills to the dogs' health care to the state of our house itself (if my mom and uncle should sell it, ect.)

Beyond that, he's also just a horrible person. He constantly makes rude and inappropriate comments that my mom writes off. I have facial piercings, and one time he asked my boyfriend (who was at the table with my family; I wasn't there) ""what else [I] had pierced."" My mom claims to not have heard this, but she still defended him and claimed that it was just a joke. Yeah, let's just completely disregard the blatantly sexual comment your shitbag boyfriend made about your daughter while she wasn't even there to defend herself. Swell.

They've been together for almost a year and this hasn't changed at all. She's lowkey acknowledged that these are ""red flags,"" but she's desperate for a relationship and is willing to let him mark his territory all over our home and lives. I thought their chances of breaking up were slim due to her desperation, but then I got that miraculous text a few days ago.

My mom told me that she had broken up with her boyfriend because she found a tracking device in her purse. I was ready to kill him, but I couldn't help but feel thrilled that this had finally made my mom snap to her senses. I was worried that he might end up doing something, so I ended up contacting his son on Facebook and telling him, ""Just wanted to let you know that our parents broke up because your dad put a tracking device in my mom's purse. You seem like a good guy, so I wanted to make sure that you knew the truth."" He responded, ""Okay, thank you for telling me."" I did this as a security precaution, just in case he snapped and ended up stalking or hurting my family. I know that it was brash, but I never expected my idiot of a mother to consider getting back with him.

Less than a day later, she said that she had spoken to him and that it was all a misunderstanding. When she confronted him, he said that he wanted to try out the tracking device and put it in her purse, but got called away for a family emergency--that last part is true--and ""didn't have a chance to tell [her]."" Mhm, sure. Because him putting a tracking device totally doesn't align with the fact that he's insanely possessive and controlling and insecure, trying to domineer every aspect of her life. He also has a penchant for ""spying"" technology: he owns drones, cameras that he has installed at (ONE OF) his ex wife's house to ""make sure she isn't touching [his] stuff,"" cameras in the front hall of our house, ect. He also owns guns and constantly brags about them, so that's a huge stressor on my end as well.

My idiot, desperate shit of a mother believed him, or tricked herself into believing him. I was furious. This was the absolute final straw for me. Everything about this guy has been a giant red flag, and I was infuriated and worried that she was willing to go back to him. I've been concerned that he would snap and potentially hurt my mom or one of us.

We got in a major argument and I laid out every single red flag that I've seen in this relationship. My mom started complaining about how she ""can't be alone for Christmas,"" and she basically admitted that she was settling for him. I explained how he could potentially be dangerous, not just to her, but to her family, and she completely wrote off my concerns. She kept saying that I was ""hurting her"" and asking me if I loved her, AKA ""will you keep putting up with my shit because I'll throw a tantrum if you don't?""

When she found out that I had messaged shitbag's son, she went into a rage and started accusing me of ruining her chances with her ex/still boyfriend. She claimed that both his ex wives are ""cheering to get him back"" (yeah, okay) and that I am making it harder for her to leave. I told her that she made her decision to leave based on the tracking device being the final straw (not the only issue) and that she should stand by her decisions and trust her instincts.

She also claims that my grandmother ""loves"" and ""trusts"" him. Let's just note that my grandmother doesn't speak English, so she doesn't comprehend what the hell is going on in their relationship. My mom hides all of the bullshit and puts on a facade, so obviously my grandmother is going to think that things are all peachy. For all sakes and purposes, she's oblivious.

When my mom told me that she was giving the shitbag another chance during Christmas, she said, word for word: ""It was all a misunderstanding. He showed me how [the tracking device] works and it is so cool. Behave yourself for my sake!"" I told her that if she wants to keep this stalking, controlling piece of shit around, then I won't be sticking around for Christmas.

Then come the guilt trips and the bullshit. Oh I'd be ""killing"" my grandmother if I wasn't here for Christmas. I'd be tearing apart the family. I need to ""have a serious talk"" with my mother for god-forbid disobeying her.

She's been spamming my phone for the past day. I managed to sneak by her on my way home from work yesterday, but she has been obsessively texting me, telling me that she needs to talk to me. She even got my uncle to harass me. When I finally responded, I told her that I wasn't feeling well and didn't feel like talking. She kept pressing the issue and trying to force me into a conversation with her, which I know will involve her trying to force me to respect her wishes and play nice with her shitbag boyfriend, but I'm not having that shit.

I've literally been having chest pains, migraines, and panic attacks because of my mom's bullshit. I can't afford to leave. My boyfriend and I both work full-time, but our student loan payments alone are the cost of rent. We're stuck here for the time being. I literally don't know what to do, but I'm becoming increasingly more anxious and depressed and I feel like nobody is in my corner. My family is putting so much pressure on me that I'm starting to feel like **I'm** in the wrong.

Does anyone have any advice? I literally don't know what to do. I don't even know if there's anything I can go but wait it out until I can afford to leave."

My racist white father found out by reading texts on my phone and was furious. He stopped calling me by my name, (used the names “it” and “animal” when addressing me) and threatened to beat me. (Saying Quote “beat the animal” to my mother.) though he never did. Neither did she. 

He said, quote, that when I turn 18 he’s going to shake my hand never talk to me again and when people ask how many kids he has he’ll say 2 and the 3rd one died. 3 being me. 
Social services got involved and it was messy, although they’ve since backed off. No physical abuse, seemed okay.

12139,c2yigs,ThrowawayAccountt55,I am 18. Just found out my birth father is 84. How do I react?,"Hi,

I have recently received a book that my birth mother made for me when I was a kid, in preparation for when I was older so I could read and understand what occured in my life up to that point. 

I have had my birth father shielded from me since I was a kid, I always was told he was a random guy she slept with one time so assumed I would never find him. Though, in this book, I was reading the family tree when I realised my dad was listed. I was happy then I saw the birth date of 1935 and it made me shit myself. 

To put this into context: my 20-year-old friend's grandparents are only late 50s/early 60s. My Dad was 9 when D-Day happened, the Queen of England wasn't the Queen when he was born and he has witnessed technology evolve as well as seeing racial segeration wiped out, JFK assassinated, 9/11, wars, Clinton scandal and so much more. 

I don't know how to react. Whilst I am very happy that I have details on people who cared for me as a kid e.g. care workers that I can find and meet, I am feeling angry and weirded out by my Dad being so much older. I don't wanna end up meeting him in a carehome and he has dementia or doesn't remember me or his family don't know he fathered a 18 year old kid, as I don't wanna ruin their lives. I also feel like I am now suddenly a very weird person considering most people my age have parents who are 40-50. Can anyone advise me on how I should be reacting and advise me on what I should do now?"

 '' I feel like nothing phases/ gets in your way. No matter what happens, you’re super chill.” 

I dont even know how I even accomplish being cool so naturally when so many others try so hard lol.

people think that ive got my shit together but in reality I simply do not.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways im just simply lost, I dont know what to do, I will probably fail this year with less then a month left and im bordeline hovering over the limit of passing, I dont know what I want to do in the future, its been like this for as long as I can remember. 

Im worried that I would be forced to work in a shitty job for years on end just to support myself to live and not really find any enjoyment, finding a girl isnt my priority either, but I just feel like im going to be single for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr  Im just lost in life, dont know what to pursue, the thought of not living anymore doesnt concern me, If I could take a pill that would end my life I probably would take it to end this constant un-certainity."

38281,7n5y5q,Takkuon,"My anger is always getting the better of me. I've tried to fix it many times, but I can't seem to do anything about it. Is there something that I am doing wrong?","**-----Beginning-----**

Long story short, I tend to be very confrontational. That is, whenever something upsets my sense of justice, I can't help but let my anger do the talking for me. 

For instance, I believe that it is not right for people to just simply berate someone on the internet because it is easier to do than doing it face-to-face, as I find that as an excuse for something far greater and disgusting within that person's psyche. That said, whenever someone shows a great deal of negativity to another person on the internet, whether it be me, my friend(s), or some stranger, I lash out in an attempt to destroy that person's values and almost force them to accept the fact that what they're doing is wrong and disgusting.

Another example would be (and I find this to be a bit more... unnecessary) that whenever someone ignores me or insults me, I almost become another person, from the usual calm/kind person that I usually am to a person who can't think of anything else than wanting to not only prove that person wrong but also to make that person feel terrible for what they've done, and I usually don't stop in my pursuit of that until I feel satisfied. In essence, I feel that I am a very angry and vengeful person on the inside, mixed with some level of being a sadist, which has been something I've been trying to fix for a long time now. 

Many tell me to think before I act, which I am capable of doing sometimes, but other times, I just can't help it; it's almost instinctual. I just lash out in anger. Of course, I'm not screaming like a maniac. When I'm angry, I'm more... honestly, ironically, I *think* better when I'm angry, as I feel that I'm put in a position, where I don't have the freedom to say something dumb/irrelevant/non-constructive to my argument against a certain person or people. That said, despite the fact that the volume in my voice doesn't change, my tone does. When I talk, I am usually gentle and try my best to come up with the best words to say to someone so as to not insult him/her. However, whenever I'm irked, my intonation becomes more coarse, my words become like a soft staccato, and I accentuate certain words in my statements so as to almost strategically lead the person I'm talking to into a state of mind that allows them to understand where I'm coming from. Of course, I add in some of my thoughts that are an attempt at either making fun of or disvaluing the other person's argument, almost as if I want to show them that I have the higher ground.

I hate that I do this to other people so much because it's torturous, condescending, and, worst of all, I enjoy it; it's not me. Whenever my boiled emotions die down, I enter a state of regret. I wasn't always regretful, as I've been like this since I was a kid. However, at a certain point in my life, I grew up and accepted the fact that I have to learn to feel remorse for letting my anger take the better of me (rather than having a more intelligent and calmer conversation) so that I could prevent myself from doing more of it in the future. However, contrary to what I had originally thought, it's done no good, as much of it is, as I said, very instinctual. Almost like a programmed mechanism to allow me to stay firm and on the ground with my sentiments; however, I just wish I could do this in a more appropriate and less insulting manner.

If anybody has ANY experience with anger management, please give me some of your wise words of advice. It may very well come a long way.

**-----End-----**

**Extra (don't have to read but will help you understand my point better, as I detail some important checkpoints in my life that may have lead me to this point)**

This is a story of my dark past, which I believe to be the epicenter of my behavior.

When I was a kid, I was always servile in my demeanor. I would always ask people what made them happy, and if it were in my power, I'd try my best to help them achieve their happiness. I've also always been good at paying attention to things, and I believe that it was because, as a kid, I had always tried to read the subtleties that would allow me to know whether or not someone whom I tried to make happy was truly pleased. That said, sometimes, I wouldn't even have to ask. I'd just know what made some of my friends/classmates/the people around me happy. However, without me even noticing it (ironic, eh?), people started using me and taking advantage of my kindness. I was too kind to even notice it, as I had always assumed that people had a great deal of goodness in them and that they would always be purely thankful to someone like me who always endeavored to make them happy. In essence, I didn't believe it were possible for people to have enough evil in them to look at someone like me as an object to fulfill their desires. However, the adults around me had started to notice that my relationship with people weren't healthy, as they were always using me. That said, I came to notice, little by little, the darkness in people and their manipulative behavior. Slowly, but surely, I started to grow more sour. Eventually, it got to the point, where I would become the exact opposite of what I was: someone who endeavored to know what made people happy and try to crush it, rather than to make it come true. 

Eventually, my mother and father moved me from a private school to a public school during the former years of my middle school career as per my request; however, little did they know, it wasn't for me to run away from the people who were manipulative. Rather, it was for me to start a new life with new people - to have an opportunity to create a fake image of myself as the nice guy who would have access to people's trust. Then, I would cleverly make them miserable, slowly such that it wouldn't be noticeable to them in the short term but enough for me to feel satisfied. What did I have to lose? It was my last year of middle school, and I wouldn't have to see those people ever again in high school (I was applying to a high school out of town). Might as well finish off middle school with a blast and try to make as many people as I possibly can unhappy - it doesn't matter what they think of me in the end. These were the thoughts that were going through my mind at the time. 

One of my most regrettable actions was rejecting a girl before she even had mustered the courage to confess to me. A 'friend' of mine (at the time), who was a friend of hers, told me that she liked me. Long story short, I devised a plan that simply went like so: I led her on, met up with her privately, and turned her down before she even gave a hint of liking me. I'd say things like ""there's no way I would've said 'yes' anyways, so it's a no"" and ""I don't want to go out with you. I don't really find you attractive"", and I'd threaten her by saying things like, ""if you tell anybody about what I just did to you, I'm going to turn you into a laughing stock."" Believe it or not, I had many people who considered me their friends, and I was, to a certain degree, popular. I had a lot of, and it's weird to use this term like this, *political power* back then, as many people would rather believe me than most other people because I had earned their trust. This is what gave me confidence to keep people quiet. Whether or not there were rumors about me spreading, I wouldn't know and quite frankly, I wouldn't have cared because I didn't really see these people as... well, people, really.

Sometimes in gym class, when we played kickball, I'd purposely kick the ball towards people's faces and apologize afterwards to hide my intent. I'd purposely peg people really hard during dodgeball; I'd throw the basketball, rather than lightly passing it; I'd 'accidentally' push people, when we were running during field day; I wouldn't pay people back; etc. These were all the little things, but that's what I wanted, as the little things would eventually add up. I'd borrow money from friends, little at a time (like $2-4) a day or every other day, but by the end of the year, I'd owe over $400 worth of money to people. Sometimes, I'd find myself getting lucky, when I'd 'accidentally' make someone go to the nurse's office with a nosebleed during gym (to which, I still can't understand why people would so easily forgive me if I made it seem like I was sincerely apologetic). Of course, I was smart about it, so I wouldn't do the same things over and over again. Otherwise, I'd get caught. So it was like a game to me: I'd come up with some creative new ways to, in a sense, bully people. The rule of the game was simple: ruin someone's day without looking like the bad guy. I'd always tell myself to do something that can be deemed as accidental. The environment mattered a lot for this to be feasible, so gym class was one of the classes, where I experimented a lot. I never got tired of this because every time I tried something, it was new and fresher than the previous idea, so there was a sense of accomplishment with every plan.

Of course, I'm a very different person now. I realized the error of my ways eventually in high school, when I met some people who restored a bit of my faith towards humanity; however, the events that transpired were during my formative years. Hence, the me of the past really has a hold on the me of now. In fact, it wasn't even that long ago that I was a terrible person, as I'm not that old. You can say terrible things about me if you want; it's your opinion and you have every right to do so. In fact, I wouldn't even be surprised if you labeled me a psychopath or insane. However, please consider that I was a pure, honest, and good kid back then; I was a VERY sensitive person, which was why I was so keen on people's happiness and why I was, to a certain degree, very perceptive, when it came to helping people. Unfortunately, that was my downfall, as my sensitivity caused me to take more mental damage than I could have ever imagined; instead of being hurt for just that moment of realization or just letting it go, I let my anger stay cooped up inside of me because of the faith I wanted to have in people. Thus, I gave the anger and pain a chance to live and fester inside of me. I let my anger, frustration, and lost trust in humanity take me down a spiral of madness. In essence, my past realizations were VERY scarring to me and haunts me even to this day. As sad as it is for me to say this, when I came to the realization of the thing people thought of me as and the terrible ways people were treating me, I became socially crippled because I didn't know what clue I could find in people that would allow me to know whether or not they truly accepted me for who I was or if they were just using me; it became easier to talk to people, when I saw them as  things and tools of my enjoyment, rather than as people. Fortunately for me, I found someone who was able to get some of these words out of me, when I needed to most. That person helped me realize that I was becoming the very monster that caused me to do such heinous things in the first place: a manipulative person who enjoys the position of being able to be domineering over other people, using their kindness towards me as a weapon against them. That's when I started to change and am now nothing more than a regretful shell of my older self: someone who wants to be kind and caring towards people again, but my anger is always there, ready to choke me and control me."

23507,9cm1vk,baboons_in_mime,How do I deal with my inferiority complex?,"After many years of suffering from depression anxiety, I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that my mental health disorders stem from something more complex: an inferiority complex.  While I’ve always experienced the feeling of inferiority to others, I’ve never really acknowledged or understood what it was until now.  It’s tearing my life apart.  It’s caused me to contemplate suicide many times.  

On the outside I have a great life.  I was blessed with superficial beauty, I have a loving husband, a toddler, a job, a roof over my head and while living paycheck to paycheck we are not considered poor.  However, I feel inferior to everyone.  I go through cycles of self-loathing and regret over never striving for my full potential.  I don’t know why anyone would love me or want to be friends with me.  And this has made it extremely hard to make and keep friends.  I always feel like they don’t really want to be around me, they’re just being nice.  I feel like I’m an inconvenience to everyone.  Deep down I know it’s not true, but i think about it every second of every day and I feel like a prisoner to my own mind.  I’m trapped and I don’t see any way out.

We don't see each other regularly, so there was no way for me to know what was going on in her life if she didn't reply to me. 

A few weeks later, we happened to meet at a party. While we were both pretty drunk, she confessed her (new) boyfriend was being (phisically) abusive and she didn't want to hang out with me because she was afraid to open up to anyone about her situation. On top of that, she is depressed and stopped going to therapy and taking her meds because he doesn't want her to. 

I immediately told her to get out of this relationship and go back to therapy (and repeated it the next morning when we were sober again). She keeps saying she loves him, but also that she is scared of what he would do if she broke up with him. I told her she can count on me if she needs help, but I don't think she wants to reach out. 

She is back to not replying to me and I can’t think of any other way to meet up with her. I’d hate to just leave it like this when she told me so much. 

Is there anything I could do to help her? What can I tell her to make her want to meet up with me?

Last year I went to therapy for depression, my personality changed significantly and I realized looks don't mean a thing. Shopping became a chore I don't like, and my best friend moved far away so I don't have anyone to go with, which makes it even less fun. 

Earlier this year I met my boyfriend, whose family invites me to dinners every weekend. I love those dinners, but I keep finding myself getting very annoyed by deciding what to wear. I don't have a lot of clothes and I feel like if I'll wear the same ones over and over they will notice and think negative thoughts on me. 

Moreover, my mom has a different outlook on clothes and looks in general- she believes a woman **has** to always look at the top of her game- wear new clothes, jewelry, makeup, high heels. Whenever I leave she checks me out and bothers me about not looking that way. I explained to her that looks don't have such a big meaning to me now, and I don't care what people think but she never listens. She keeps bothering me about it over and over every single weekend.

I also have a Sensory Processing Disorder, which has an impact on this matter- most clothes have seams and little tickets that drive me **insane** or make me itch like crazy.  This makes shopping even harder because I don't find enough clothes that don't bother me. My mom thinks I made this disorder up and doesn't listen."

So a month later, she went to the chemists and bought a pregnancy test, and it flagged a positive.  She went to the doctors, who confirmed it.    She told me in no uncertain terms, that this little boy was my son.  Looking at him, it's possible.      


I've asked her a lot of questions, like ""why didn't you tell me sooner?"" and suchlike.  It's a difficult thing to come to terms with.  I want to ask for a paternity test, but I don't even know where to begin.    


What do I do with this? I've just met a child who could be my son, and a mother who has turned up out of the blue, and left me very confused with a lot of strange feelings."
24627,96zhv3,robloxdruglord,Need advice with friends,"Last year I had way more friends. I was overall extremely happy and living the life. I faded away from being friends with them and haven’t been for a long while. I have like 3 good friends now but they are all way better friends with each other than they are w me. I had a very rough year so I haven’t been able to recover to the point where I can naturally be myself and socialize at ease. I am a very very very extroverted person, but I can’t be that because I lost a lot of social skills. I can’t start conversations and I’m pretty bad at holding them. I hate it so much it’s not who I am. I used to be so good at it. I can’t hang with my current friends a huge amount bc they all smoke weed and weed is part of this problem for me it affects my mental health way too much. I want to make other friends that don’t smoke all the time and I just want a lot of friends I feel lonely 24/7, how do I bounce back, my old routines and natural flow of life are gone because I have nothing to guide me. My habits are gone. "
7983,cnm9a2,McPythonface,I'm trying to convince my boss to let me work up until the night so I can learn German in the morning,"I recently moved to Germany to work as a programmer (even though I don't speak a word of German) and in the office I work we only communicate in english.

I was searching for German courses and I found about an intensive course, which takes place during the morning.

Since my working hours are quite flexible (as long as I stay for 8 hours a day) I figured it wouldn't be a problem if I had classes in the morning and worked from the afternoon to the night.

I asked my boss today if it was possible and as much as he would like his employees to learn German, he believes studying for 4 hours a day and working another 8 hours will make me less productive at work.

As much as I understand his point, this is something that is very common where I come from (Brazil), and I think I can do it.

I don't know what I could do to convince him, and I'm starting to think ""what if he's right?"" and things lkke that.

I really want to learn German, but I feel really lost right now, since I was alredy planning some things around this.

What can I do to convince him?"

21205,asrolc,fdrxxii,My thirteen yr old little brother is getting tattoos.,"So last weekend me and some of my friends went to Charlotte to meet up with some old friends that live there. My mom couldn't be at home and she didn't want to leave him home alone as he has a history of self harm/ suicide attempts. So I brought him along as well as two of his friends both 15. So the night was coming to a close it was around 2 am and we were getting ready to come home. But then out of nowhere an 18 yr old friend of mine suggests that we all go to the beach I was tired I had church in the morning so I said no. But my 13 yr old brother and his two friends were obviously on board. I said hell no. You don't know this person well, he's not trustworthy his car always smells like weed, and he's 5 years older than you. After a long argument and many warnings from me he left. Now I was worried about it and didn't know what to do so I just let it go. He had apparently talked to my mom about it and she said okay so I just let it be. So then the next time I saw him it was two days later and I saw something weird on his hands. Just for context I have two tattoos a cross on my left arm and a ""mi vida loca"" behind my ear. I explained to him that is has religious significance it represents the holy trinity. But if it's on your face or hands it has ties to time in prison and is vaguely gang related. So he comes back with AMLK on his left hand under his thumb and a ""mi vida loca"" on his left hand. I was extremely angry. I was angry at him for getting tattoos at 13, especially because he got gang tattoos and he's obviously not in a gang. And I tried to explain  that for the rest of your life you're going to have these, cops will see them, employers will see them, your teachers will see them. But I was also angry at the kid they went with. I was angry that this kid who I didn't trust from the start would give my THIRTEEN YEAR OLD brother a tattoo. I just don't know what to do and really need some advice so I came here."
16889,bfpeea,Burner3687,Fiance's Mom diagnosed terminal and passed away in less than a month. I'm worried he isn't processing it. What do I do?,"My fiance is not the particularly emotional type so I'm certainly not expecting him to cry and loudly lament or anything, but he's been strangely normal since we found out she passed away a few days ago, and we haven't even gone to see his Dad or siblings. 

I don't get it because when my parents' times come I know I will want to be with my family. It just feels like he is going about his day as if everything is normal. Maybe that is just how he needs to deal? 

It worries me though because he has a tendency to experience his emotions more physically, like with stomach aches and gut problems. I'm worried he is pushing everything down and it's going to make him sick. 

I know it might also be that it doesn't really feel real until you're slapped in the face with it at the funeral. What I don't know is whether he's trying to put off facing the reality or if he's just taking it as it comes. I don't want to be pushy or try to force him to talk about it. I'm just trying to be supportive as best I can and keeping an eye on him so I can note any concerns. I'm also not pushing my feelings aside because I know I need to process them properly to be able to be there for him. So yes, I've cried. I loved her very much. 

I'm just at a loss about what to do and what to look out for. I'm generally very emotionally tuned in and read peoples' emotions very well, but even though he is my fiance and we share a home and I know him extremely well, I'm having a hard time getting a read on how he is really feeling. I don't know what to do or how to help!"

She doesn’t even talk to me at all now so thats BS.

30712,8cig8e,redditlurker1204,How can I start my life?,"Hi reddit, I’m really upset and looking for some help. I just had another screaming match with my mom, which is not uncommon, my mom enjoys arguing. It’s always been her and I, and for as long as I can remember my mom has always screamed and used physical punishment when she’s upset with me or I did something wrong. I was even in foster care due to her leaving marks on me but that was apparently all my fault and I made it up, she once said that I wanted to stay with my foster family because the dad was a pedophile and he’d come in to my room at night (never happened). 
  
Anyways, my mom has horrible anger issues and can’t control her impulses when she gets to a certain point. Since it’s always been my mom and I we are very close but when we argue it’s horrible. Sometimes we have a few weeks where we don’t argue but then something sets her off and we have a blow up. I’ve lived like this all my life and I truly believe it’s the reason I’ve struggled with self esteem and anxiety and depression issues. It makes me sad to even type this because I love my mom and I love when we get along, but it’s like she’s two different people sometimes. She will be loving and nice and we will go out and laugh and then other times she’s so negative and argumentative and escalates to abuse. 

I’m going to graduate high school in the next two years, my mom wants me to live at home to save money while I go to college. I’ve thought that it sounds like a good idea on the money saving front but i know families aren’t supposed to be like this. I love my mom but I don’t think I can live with her for six more years if things continue like this. So my question is, is it realistic to move out and live in a dorm / apartment while going to school and having a part time job? How do I do it?

394,ds1hrk,bot_says,My asian roommate hates that I am white.,"It’s my first year in college, and I got a random roommate. We get along okay, but mainly because I spend every moment outside of our room &amp; don’t sleep there most nights. There are many reasons for this, but I wanted advice on one in particular. She constantly brings up the fact that I am white and critiques me for it. For example:

•I made oatmeal this morning. She asked me to stop making “white food” in our microwave. 

•I put on makeup one morning. She calls this activity “so white”

•My friends come in the room for a moment. She says “omg caitlin allll of your friends are white”

•She comes home from a day in chinatown. I’m asking her about it, and she brings up a word I don’t know. I ask her what it means. She calls me “an uncultured white girl”

•She is a nursing major, and I am an environmental science major. She tells me my major “is such a white thing to pick” and that I could “never handle nursing being white”

It’s come to the point where almost every conversation we have comes back to the point of me being white. Does anyone have any advice on this?

Thank you!"

38129,7nl5sz,iEmoto,It seems like I've lost every contact I had,"Hey, I'm 22, going to school, and just had a tonsilis removal + uvula shortening in december. I got a bunch of painkillers to actually cope with the pain after the operation, and appearantly I had massive personality changes and mood swings due to the amount of painkillers I got perscribed by the doctors. In december, I've lost my partner and my friends as I seemed to act 'out of place' and weird around them.

Of course I was shocked and tried to save the relationship, with no efforts. I was heartbroken and depressive for a while, but they said we might get another chance at that what we've been, wich i am looking forward to. Of course, I thought htis means aslong I act nice around them, they may give me another chance, but I think I've only did that by the delusions I had on painkillers. Through that I've not just distanced myself further away from my partner but also from my friends who avoid me since almost a week due to my weird act.

Now, I told my partner that I was probably suffering of the sideeffects of the painkillers, and since I've took them off I haven't been feeling as depressive and confused, though now that I am left all behind in a month where I was mostly alone, what should I do - I've lost my partner and friends within just some mere weeks and I feel like living is unfair. I've even told my family about the situation and they say I should just stop contacting them in general, but they're my friends and from previous experiences, pushing aside contacts for the own good just hurt me and my surroundings even more.

sincere

edit: this is weird. I've finally heard what the real reason is of all the contacts that left me, and I feel like they are justified to do so. I've hurt my partner over the course of the year so many times with actions I thought were innocent. I feel disappointed in myself, mostly because I am the person who hurt my partner the most. I really hope I will change my immature behaviour over the year and I'll look forward to become someone worth of their love.

I know I will someday show this to you my love, and I don't know if I'll loose the love I have for you until then, but you should know that 2018 will be the year of changes. Your friends may dislike me for a long time, but it's okay. I deserve it, and nothing can justify what I've done. Even if it can't be justified, I hope, no, I wish we'll be back together. I wish you and I can forgive my actions, and even if it seems hard for you to do so, it's just as bad for myself. I look at myself and feel like that I don't deserve to live - I don't want to die either, so that's funny, isn't it? you're precious to me, and I don't want to loose you either. I feel like you'll hate me for posting this up here without giving in more information about what all that happened, but I can't just put it all in simple words.

From the past me."
5975,cyb39v,musttryharderman,I feel like I screwed up my entire life and now every day I try to distract myself from how miserable I am - but I could change it all...,"I should be happy - at least I think so. I live in a beautiful place and don't have to work full time. I can do all the outdoor stuff like hiking and cycling. And yet this morning I laid in bed thinking I could just check out and avoid feeling so damned low all the time (but it would kill my family so it isn't an option).

My wife took early retirement and we moved to the mountains a little earlier than I would have liked. I had a decent job and we could have saved a lot more if I worked for a year or two longer. Money is a big factor in my unhappiness now. I live 1000s of miles away from the country I left to be with her, and we haven't been back in years. I miss my home terribly, despite the scenery around here. My relationship with my family has changed for the better in the time I've been away, but I haven't seen them in years either.

I thought that being able to follow a more creative career path would be perfect for me. I thought I'd love being able to wander the mountains all day. I did love all of that for a while, but now I'm bored and lonely. I miss having mental puzzles to solve in my work. I miss everything about a normal town. I miss getting paid regularly! I didn't realize just how much I needed a job that uses my brain. It wasn't just for the money. I see that now. A good job gives structure and purpose.

My wife is emotionally abusive. I don't think she realizes, but that doesn't change the way she behaves now. I've tried to tell her my concerns about the jobs, money, location, direction etc, but she's not interested in listening. She no longer wants to travel, especially overseas.

I got what I thought would be a dream, but it hasn't worked out that way. The beautiful tiny town feels like a prison now. My freedom from normal work is taking away my opportunities to see the places I'd like to visit, and has left me without any purpose to my life. I have nothing to aim for unless I make some drastic changes first. Most days I'm just alone, killing time.

I feel guilty for not being happy here. This is what we worked for, but it's no longer enough for me. I want to feel financially secure. I want a job that fulfills me. I want to see my family. I want to get to know my home country better than I do. I feel like a stranger here. Every day I ask myself - do I suck it up and accept my lot, or do I follow my heart and just go 'home' to start over (at the risk of screwing up and wishing I had stayed here?) Everyone else seems happy here, so why can't I just be happy?"

Or ""Stop showing your feelings and care, it doesn't suit you."" and so on... This has been bothering quite a few years, since I've been a little child actually and I have no clue why that is. All I know is that I'm basically judging myself and I feel like I can't express myself. So I want to know if somebody else has this and what to do to stop it."

28940,8jtyv2,DVAngie,I need some feed back and advice on my current life situation...,"Like the title says I have no idea what to do with my life... Ever since i was like 13 I had only one goal in mind Go to Uni abroad and study art(Drawing, Painting, etc...) and after that move to japan become a game designer or a mangaka (weebish i know), find a good girl and eventually get married.

But now that I've actually graduated high school, going abroad to study is almost impossible since i just dont have the money... and loans are pretty much out of the question since I dont want to be in crippling debt for the rest of my life. University in my home country would be completely useless in my eyes (and in the eyes of every company) and none of the courses they offer me interest me or seem of any use for my future. My mom wants me to go to Uni and i would like to go too, but going to university in my home country (Portugal) just seems useless and i lose all my motivation to go...

During my senior year i found another passion that rivaled drawing which was Music (in particular singing) even though i wasnt good at it, i was decent and most people told me i had potential. I've thought multiple times about investing in that and becoming a singer, but the voice in the back of my head tells me to invest in drawing, but when i think about investing only in drawing and take music as an hobbie the same voice returns and tells me to not give up music.

I simply dont know what to do, i took a gap year to think about stuff and i got nothing... I'm simply stuck in a routine the last 7 years feel like all the same to me (The people are the same, what i do is the same, the results are always the same), it's boring, stagnant, Uninteresting, I'm tired of the same, i want a change of pace, something to shake my world up! 

I thought about giving up the idea of going to Uni and just go and travel for a bit clear my head meet new people, shake things up a bit, but I'd like to go to Uni too... So I'm basically stuck in this dilemmas of wanting to go to Uni but not being able to unless I stay in my home country, not knowing what passions to follow and make a career out off, and honestly just feeling lost, bored and stagnant with life.

I'm 19 yo(turning 20 next month) and i always prided myself of knowing what i wanted to do in comparison with my peers, but now that the time as actually come i dont have the means to do so  and the certainty of WHAT i actually want to do.

Two things that im sure of is that i WANT to end up living in Japan(for more weebish as that sounds i just love the culture and everything about the country) and that i want to be Adored(famous) by the community im part off be it Music our art.

Im sure that that are a lot of things left unsaid in this post so if any questions arise, id be more than happy to reply.

If you took the time to actually read this MASSIVE wall of text i salute you and hope you can help me.

Sincerely,

a man who's lost in life"

37657,7p3siu,life-is-a-slice,Gaming man! Angry wife!,"I am a 40 year old man who has been with the same woman for 16 years. We have 2 kids together who are 8 and 10. I started playing video games quite extensively after the birth of our second son. My wife accuses me of neglecting her, the children and the house for years. She claims that I left her to care for the kids, I left her with the cooking, the grocery shopping, the cleaning, the yard work and to make sure the bills were paid all on top of working a full time job. We often had arguments regarding my inability to wake up with our kids if needed during the night or in the morning as I was often too tired due to a long night of gaming. She claims that living with me as a gammer was the equivilant of having a live in babysitter. My wife in the last couple of years had completely grown tired of me being a gammer, so much so that she was contemplating divorce. We no longer slept in the same bed, we barely spoke and had not had sex in years. In an attempt to improve my marriage I was able to limit my video game play, I became more attentive towards the kids and the house work and I left behind the late night gaming. Our marriage was starting to improve, I felt my wife becoming more attracted to me, she finally started wearing her wedding ring again, we started sleeping in the same bed at times and we recently had sex for the first time in 5 years!
In the past month I downloaded a new game which I find really enjoyable. I have increased my video game play throughout the day and have started to game again late at night but only when she choses not to sleep in the same bed as I do. I make sure the house is clean and the kids needs are met however my wife is starting to become increasingly angry with me. I do not believe this is fair as I am doing what she asked of me in regards to household responsibilities. I work full time and bring home a good pay check. I feel I am not the same gammer I once was. My wife states she is ok with me playing video games for a reasonable amount of time and I gather from our arguments that would be around 2-3 hours a day. She does not agree with my late night gaming and get very angry that I am up so late talking and playing with other people online. However my conversations are not inappropriate in any way. As a comrpomise she has requested I turn them off at midnight. 
Gaming is my passion and I often get lost in time playing them as time just seems to fly by. Also the crew I play with are in different time zones so gaming needs to take place late at night so I am able to play with them. I feel 6 hours of gaming after a full day of work and gaming as I desire on the weekends is acceptable provided I have attended to the kids needs, I have helped around the house and I have been involved in family activities. My wife argues that the amount of time I play games is unattractive and unappealing. She states she will not settle for another round of ""video game addiction"". I just wish she would understand that gaming is fun for me, it is the only thing that I am good at and it gives me great satisfaction. What can I do to convince her otherwise."
23821,9ax8u2,mrfishiz,I feel that I've become an unhappy - angry - disgusting person [24/M],"So I need to give some context first.

I'm a 24 year old guy , and my life have been a pile of crap up until a point where they became better.

When I say "" a pile of crap "" I don't mean that I had to live on the streets, or that I had to sell my TV or go bankrupt , I mean emotinally and mentally.

I have always been sort of an oddball kind of person , I am a bonafide introvert but I don't shy away from stressful situations or social interactions, though I mostly like to listen because my talking can be a bit awkward.

Most of my life I lived as a loner , because of my ADHD and hyperactivity I always had problems with people in general, when I was little I either:

A: Took my drugs (ritalin) and stayed silent as a robot, uncofident, unable to speak, tired most of the day, never ate anything and that caused me to be fat (because I used to eat a lot at night)

or

B: A violent piece of crap that had tendencies to annoy people , to beat up people, or just to cause trobule for everyone (without ritalin controlling me I really was a violent person).

Neither of these sitautions helped me to gain any long lasting friends , or good social skills or even education for that matter.

When I was in the 3rd grade my dad bought my my first PC , since that day my life has been on a track of lonliness and pain.

I became addicted , no.. STILL am addicted to playing video games, playing games is something I can do all day every day (though not so much anymore) , and it used to take precedence over hanging with whomever been my friend at the time, over having a good stable relationship, over family, work and school.

Now a days I am more restrained , I am not going to give up my favorite hobby but I think I've managed to put it in a good spot ,a spot where I can give priority to family work and education.. but alas it's too little too late.

Because of all the stuff I said above.. I became an unhappy - angry - lonely person.. with barely anyone to call a friend.. to be honest I have no one I can consider a good friend whom I can share my thoughts with, and it's killing me..

I barely smile anymore, I lost my sense of humor, I can't get a relationship because I am always so serious and I don't know what to say.. only ask dumb questions.

I don't know how to get friends , I don't know what to really do with myself.

I have a job that I hate, I have a sister that I live with and don't get along with.. and I am cold, I feel cold.

This path that my life are at, I can only blame myself for getting addicted to gaming , but I don't know what I can do to make it better.

I don't know how to meet new people and make them my friends, I don't know how to meet a new woman and make her give me a chance, I don't know what to do.

I thought about going to a psychologist , but I'm not sure.. for me it's like throwing the towel (paying money for a person to hear me out).

I feel depressed and unmotivated , and it's killing me.

Just wanted to share, since I have no one to say these words to."
17705,bbjl8p,notsuicidalyet0100,Is it ethical to fake being suicidal?,"I am depressed and struggle with bad anxiety. I am also Asperger's.

I went to the doctors multiple times to get myself tested for depression and anxiety, but each time, they tell me I am not depressed or anxious. Instead, they will try to get me to a therapist. The therapists are only available once a month, and all also say that I am not depressed or anxious. I don't know why. I think it's because I don't really show my emotions very much. I can't seem to relax even in the doctor's office. I have spent at least $500 overall on therapist and psychiatrist appointments. My dad's insurance is very good, but the copays are out of pocket. I can't afford to just try again.

I cry myself to sleep and have drifted away from my friends and family. I'm lonely and desperate, and I hate myself. My grades are suffering in school, and that's costing me even more money. I just want this to stop. I want my life back.

My suicidal thoughts tend to be of running away, not dying. I don't want to die. I would never end my own life. But I still fantasize about running away and not telling anyone where I'm going. I think this is the same thing as being suicidal because it is for the same reasons as someone else might kill themselves for, and I also have written letters to people in the past while crying and thinking about running away. I also sometimes have intrusive thoughts about cutting myself. 

One thing I have been thinking about is pretending to be suicidal. If I created a plan and answered the questionnaire at the therapist's office as though I were a suicidal person, the doctors might take me seriously instead of brushing me off. I know it's a lie, but I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live like this, and I also can't just show up the same as I used to. I don't need a therapist to tell me that my problems are solvable, I need medication so that my brain will work again!

I don't know if this is legal or not, or what their reaction will be. What if they hospitalize me and then find out I lied about being suicidal? Would I have to pay for everything that my insurance would normally cover? What if they still shrug me off and tell me that I'm fine? What if they direct me to the suicide hotline and tell me that if I do that, all my problems will be solved? The doctors at my insurance seem to really not want to do anything about my depression or anxiety. Even when I went out of network, other psychiatrists would not give me any medication and just referred me to therapy (costed another $300 total).

Thank you for your help."

18294,b7zkbw,lilahjl,My mother does everything for my 13 year old brother,"My (19F) mother (47) does everything for my 13 year old brother. By that i mean she treats him like he is 7 years old, and she has treated him like this as soon as i can remember. But before that she was just overprotective over him, and it was normal since he was young. But now he is 13 (soon 14) and it has started to get weird, and in my opinion this is not good for a 13 year old that needs to start learning how to take care of himself.  

For example, he never has to clean up after himself because my mother does everything for him. As soon as he wakes up in the morning he has breakfast on the table and my mom makes his bed as he eats his breakfast. After that he just leaves the table, and my mom goes and picks it up and washes the plates etc. this is just an example, but it’s like that for every meal. If my brother is hungry he just says “i’m hungry” and my mom starts making sandwiches for him. I think i’ve seen him make food for himself 2 or 3 times a year.  

When he spills something, my mom cleans it up and so on and so on...  

When i was 13, i was cooking for myself, making my own breakfast, and my parents always made me was my own dishes and stuff like that.  My mom has always been very protective over my brother and spoiled him, always taking his side and doing everything for him. My mom loves my brother a lot, and i know my mom loves me too but because of her behavior towards him i’ve always felt like she favorited him a bit. I think it’s also because he is still young and her last child. This has also gotten a lot worse since my brother got depression after he got diabetes, and he is currently out of school since almost a year. So our family situation is very difficult right now, and i understand why my mom wants to care for him so much in this way. I’ve tried talking to her and said “i don’t think it’s good that you do so much for him, he needs to learn how to start taking care of things himself” and she always agrees with me, but it never changes.  

Obviously this isn’t going to mess him up for life or anything like that, but i believe that this situation is unhealthy for my brother. Especially because of his depression, i believe it would be good for him to start building confidence by doing stuff for himself more.  

Is this unhealthy for him? How can i explain to my mom that her behavior is unhealthy for my brother? "
31737,88owdo,Zwicka,I apologize if this is a small issue but..,"I've been collecting and keeping most if not all of my highschool papers as well as papers from the past year of community college (its my first year) and I'm unsure how to sort through them, and if I should just throw them away.

I'm sorry for this spiraling from the first topic, but just by thinking about that, this ends up happening where I feel hopeless. Is there a way to get my motivation back?

The other day I just started feeling really low, and realised that my friend and I won't be spending as much time together anymore.  We spend way too much time together.  But I also realise that I should spend less time with her so that I can move on.  I just feel a bit down because she has really helped me grow as a person...really, I am far from the same person I was over a year ago.

What gets me all the time is that she treats me so special.  I was at a function with a bunch of people from out friend group, and instead of coming over and saying hi to everyone, she ran her hand down my back and said hi Jiiiimm.  We've known each other a while,  but the way she does things just get me going.  The only women who have ever done things like that have been intimate with me.  She never asks me things directly and always in a round about way, its just frustrating me.

Then there's no place I feel quite as comfortable as when I'm with her.  We might still spend a lot of time together because she keeps saying were gonna spend more time together.

Then the other day when I went to her party everyone was so happy to see me, I had no idea.  I also didn't realise that she talks to her partners (she's poly) about me all the time.  They know things about me I only told her.  I though I was just another friend but apparently not.  Things like this leave me happy but confused.

TL;DR:I don't even know what questions  I should ask really.  Should I have DTR talk with her because I'm just confused?  I like her and I think she has some sort of feeling for me.  I just feel like we hit a wall because we never talk directly."

31859,8885hg,ACatInATrenchcoat,Am I being brought into a pyramid scheme?,"Okay, so this is the second time I've had this happen to me almost step by step, so it feels like an actual thing, so I was hoping maybe you guys might have an idea of what's happening.

So, today I had a woman come into my workplace where we're doing a warehouse sale. She came in and immediately complimented my jacket. I said thank you, and we launched into conversation. She introduced herself by name and asked my name in return pretty much right off the bat, which is sorta weird for a customer to do, but alright. Then she ended up asking me a bunch of random things about my workplace, if I like it, how long I've worked here, what got me to stay here for so long, if I saw myself staying there long term, just a bunch of vaguely personal questions about my workplace experience. I answered, because whatever. She said she just moved here from LA, maybe she's just trying to make friends or something, I don't know. I get a lot of nosey customers, so this wouldn't be a first. 

Now, this whole time, she hasn't looked at a thing in the store. Not even a glance around, which I didn't think was too weird until the end. 

We talk about random stuff, how I'm not doing to school because debt and no future plans and whatnot, again, not too weird, whatever. As we finally get closer to closing time in the store, she says she would love to have my number to ""connect me with awesome contacts she has"". After all that, she says her husband just texted her (pretty sure that's bull, didn't notice her actually checking her phone the whole time we were talking), says it was nice to talk to me, and leaves. Again, no looking at any of the actual product. It was like she came in the store with the intention of talking to whoever worked there. She just got into her car and drove away.

This same thing happened to me last year, just with a different person who either actually had originally intended on looking around and got sidetracked talking to me, or was just better at looking like that was the case. The lady last year and I chatted about pretty much all the same subjects, and she wanted my number so she could hook me up with her connections and meet up for coffee to talk about it. Both ladies where young or youngish, clean cut, normal looking people. I have no idea what either of them actually mean by the whole ""connections"" thing.

So, fellow Redditors, any ideas? What are people trying to get me into?"

24274,98y9lr,breakupthrowaway33,Do I have any right to be offended?,"Hi All!

I was really offended / hurt today and I'm trying to determine if I am being irrational. Just looking for some objective input.

I have a good friend named Paul. Paul and I went through some really crazy times together (grad school / breakups / successes / etc) for years, but I moved across the country about 6 months ago. After I left Paul said he'd come out and visit one day. About two months ago we made plans for him to come the weekend of 8/17 to visit. While our plans were somewhat vague, we planned on going to a sporting event together one night / meeting up with some of my friends another night / going to a restaurant another night. Nearly every day was planned with at least 1 activity. We spent a few weeks back and forth discussing what weekends would work best for us.

The following then happened:

* About a month ago Paul said he wouldn't be able to make the weekend of 8/17, because he forgot he had another friend visiting him. He asked if we could reschedule for 8/24. **No problem these things happen.**  

* Paul then texted me asking if I would mind if he invited Bob to the sporting event. Bob lives in my city and Paul knows I don't like him, but said it would be weird to be in my city and not reach out. **No problem I get that, so I said sure.**  

* Paul called last night and told me that he was staying with Bob while he is in town. Bob lives about 30 min away from where I live. **This is when I started getting a bit offended. I'm 90% sure that Paul and I talked about him staying near me.**  

* Paul then told me Bob and him were discussing what to do the night we were supposed to meet up with my friends. He told me he wanted to find something we could all do together.

**\*\*tl;dr\*\* It's now obvious that Paul isn't visiting me, he's visiting Bob. While that is fine, and I understand things can become awkward, I really, really don't like Bob and don't feel like hanging out with him all weekend. I feel like it was pretty rude to insert Bob into all of our plans. Am I out of line?**"
34072,8123f3,cruznr,A friend of mine has been witness to some really inappropriate stuff at work and can't turn to HR. What should she do?,"A friend of mine works at a small business that mostly white (she's Filipino, and there's only one other non-Caucasian staff member in a staff of about 20). It's a small business so things are pretty casual, but the owner takes this to the next level. My friend has seen him make borderline-racist comments trying to pass them off as jokes, literally slap co-workers' asses (several of his friends are part of the staff), and other inappropriate things. The HR department is composed of one staff member who is the owner's best friend.

My friend has kept quiet about a lot these events but she finally broke down after she caught the owner prank-messaging the HR guy (his best friend) in a Filipino accent - which, according to him, was just to misspell every other word he typed and typing broken English. He straight up told my friend what he was doing while he was doing it - WHILE she was in his office. This transpired not one month after he had sent out new company policies to the whole company that emphasized a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriateness at work, among other shady policies regarding employee IP. 

My friend is writing  her two-weeks notice now, but she almost feels compelled to take legal action because she can't even approach HR for fear that he would just sweep it under the rug. How should she approach this? "

14922,bphjm9,ChiodoS04,Should I stay at my current job,"A year ago this month I joined a wholesale distributor as their international sales rep.  This designation is special in the company, since I am the only one who works on the international sales.  When I joined there was no commission/bonuses for any sales reps.  I didn’t mind this since I get decent perks/benefits although the pay is not great.  This spring, corporate cleaned up shop, fired the President, many directors and managers and hired/promoted a few people.  They made the decision to move over to commission, and add “spiffs”.
 
I was excited, then i found out that I was not included in the commission/sales program that they had setup, they have also decided that I do not need to be a part of sales meetings/calls (I don’t mind reading the emails that show what they went over, but still).  Not only that, but many of the vendor products that I had been selling, have blocked us from being able to export outside of the country (they have grown, and set up there own outside sales teams internationally). I have increased the international sales by about 30%, I’m about to hit $1.8 million in sales since I started, I am currently being ignored by sales managers and the director, and I do not feel like I am being compensated enough for what I do. 

I have had nothing but positive feedback from managers that have worked with me, with a manager trying to move me over to work in their department (it ended up not working out)

28941,8jtyq7,JeffTheThrowaway915,Soo.. I Don't know how to ask for help with this but here I go NSFW possibly idk if it counts.,"So I guess to begin with I should say whats going on. 

I've grown a disgusting thing from rape and I'm not entirely sure its just a ""kink"" at this point. I'm a young man mid way through high school always dealt with mental illnesses such as depression, I'm a sociopath or at least that is what I from my old therapist, I don't feel remorse, joy, or  the only reason I'm saying this is cause I don't feel any remorse and that might be the part that kick started this all, or at least made possibly dangerous as far as my girlfriend believes.

She only found about this because I felt like I needed to reach out for someone to get this taken care of or helped, she is kinda my life blood if I could describe her in any way. Though knowing I'm young I also know that could always change, no matter how much I don't want to admit it.

She suggested I talk to someone I trust whom I believe could help, and this where glorious reddit comes in and hopefully help me. I've been here a long time on my actual account but I made a throwaway for a couple of reasons. None of I ever thought would be this.

Anyways so me and my girlfriend were very sexually active, her father and mother knew and so did mine we were safe etc, and she kinda just cut it all off to study.. and one thing happened after another.. I devolped a rape kink, and as time went on it got worse and worse, and the other day.. I uhm paid my friend to relive a past event in her life and describe all of it in great detail, every bit of pain and misery it made her feel.. cause it was the only thing that saited that sexual hunger.. When ever I do it to ""normal"" porn, I don't get really even as much as hard.. I'm starting to crave more again.. And thats why I reached out.. Cause I know I did something terrible when I made a friend relive that experience for my own pleasure. 

   Currently I don't know what to do, don't know how to help this. I believe I might become a danger, and I don't know what to do to stop this ""Hunger"""
5345,d1quqb,astrangeevent2,How do I answer my 16 year old daughter's questions?,"I am sorry if I come across as a very possessive mother, but I certainly do not approve of my daughter's \[16F\] best friend who is just an eleven year old girl. They share a common fondness for physical activities and go to the same tennis academy.

The biggest problem is that my daughter's friend has a weird notion that ""pretty"" girls tend to lose to the ""tomboyish"" ones. The only example she can cite in support of her argument is Maria Sharapova's losing streak against Serena Williams. I have no idea how she comes up with such ideas at such a young age. Perhaps her parents use it to motivate her. People in the academy frequently call my daughter the most beautiful girl in her academy, much against my wishes. The opinions of this eleven year old have had a noticeable impact on her performance. 

When these two practice against each other, I expect my daughter to win easily, owing to the age difference between the two. However, my daughter has lost all her matches against her friend. She never even wins a set! Unlike her matches against her peers, this eleven year old makes my daughter scamper about the court, while hardly breaking a sweat herself. In their latest practice match, my daughter lost 0-6,0-6 which is not a great scoreline. She appeared quite exhausted despite the quick defeat.

At the end of the match, I was afraid my daughter might burst into tears. However, she kissed her friend on both cheeks at the net - a ritual that I found a bit unusual. Later, when her friend had departed, she asked me in secret : ""Mamma, do you think I am a weak girl? Why else would I always lose to Alice?"" This question worried me quiet a lot. I explained that tennis involves a lot of strategy unlike a raw test of strength such as arm wrestling. The next day, my daughter unexpectedly challenged her friend to an arm wrestling contest to test out my theory. She lost that contest as well. How do I reassure my daughter now? Why does she always appear cheerful after losing? Why does she come up with these disturbing questions later?

TL;DR: My daughter asked me a disturbing questions after losing a tennis match. How do I assure my daughter that she is not weaker than her friend?"

We’re best friends, we do everything together. I’ve confided in her about everything from school to sexuality, and even suicidal thoughts. She’s done the same. 

A few weeks ago she texts me: “going on a date w/ my bf, talk to u soon.” Then about halfway through her date she mentions how he was on another girl’s instagram and he was ignoring her the entire time. She told me she was considering breaking up with him. 

I text her back later that night and she doesn’t respond, then at around 11 pm, she texts me “it’s all good, I’ve made up with him.” 

It honestly infuriated me, this wasn’t their first fight, it was at least their 15th. And she tells me: “it’ll be different this time, he said so”; which she’s also said at least 15 times. 

I then choose to be honest with her, “you’re not acting in your best interest” I said, and described the situation as I see it. 

As I’m talking to her, her boyfriend(T), messages me. “fuck off out of our lives.” “KNOW YOURE(sic) PLACE” and a plethora of other insults. Which honestly riled me up further. 

I was expressing how I felt about the whole situation to the girl and he decides to get involved with a ton of insults, and the whole thing felt childish. He then deleted all of the texts, where he was being aggressive and sent screenshots to the girl. 

This led her to losing it and getting mad at me, which is justifiable because from her perspective: I messaged him first and began throwing insults. Me and her had a long talk about what this all meant and the only thing that came out of it was that she was going to keep her relationship with me and her relationship with her boyfriend separate. She isn’t gonna talk to me about him nor to him about me. 

I was in the wrong here, I know that. I shouldn’t have said the things I said and that’s my fault. But the real problem is because I don’t know what to do now. 

She wants to be my friend still, and I want to be hers too. But whenever I spend time with her, I’m instantly brought back to the situation, how she took his side and attacked me. Some nights I stay up looking at screenshots from the texts, trying to see what I could have, should have, said. 

It’s frustrating and I have no one to blame but the situation, what do I do?"

My best friend and I met when we were 18, so almost 10 years ago. Lets call her K. K and I are as close as can be. Weve seen eachother fully naked, held eacother while we cried, know and love eachothers families, etc. We lived together for a year in college too. I was even asked to be her Maid of honor when she got engaged. She has me in her phone as ""wifey"" and we literally call eachother ride or die best friends cause weve always discussed how NOTHING could ever break our bond. We tell everyone were sisters cause thats just how close we are. 

K and I text every day. As well as text we snap our daily makeup/outfits. We also regualrly tag eachother in facebook memes and Insta posts of mutual intrest. Not a day goes by that I dont hear from K in SOME capacity. even if we don't have a conversation that day we are present through social media. 

K has some relationship issues with her fiance, about 4 months ago he admitted to cheating on her. She was distraught but thte relationship had already gone to shit and was headed in that direction. So she started looking for apartments, I helped her in that search. I also offered her our spare room until she found something she liked. I brought her boxes for packing things in and offered up our truck for moving day as well as our help moving her things. 

I tried to be as supportive as possible. I took her to lunch and let her vent. I never talked bad of her fiance but I did agree she diserved better and that the relationship had met its expiration long ago. When she ultimatley decided to stay with him I internally was upset cause I wanted better for her. But I supported her in the decision and told her to ignore those who tried to input their negative opinions. I even tried to set up a double date to try and get their dating life back on track. 

about a month later things were still fine. Buisness as usual. Until March 20th. She had texted me about a funny situation at her job and we laughed and jokes about it. I texted her the following day askin if she wanted to checkout the new spa in town with me that she had suggest to me on groupon the week earlier. No answer. Hmm okay. Snapped her. She opened, no reponse. Tageed her on FB no ""like"" or comment. okay....I wait a few days and text her again on the March 26th about a situation with a celebrity we both like. No answer. She read the text though.  This is when I start to get worried. I continued to keep an eye out for her on other platofroms. She hasnt posted on FB since the 20th, she hasnt added to her snap story since then, and her twitter is the same. This is very unlike her. 

At this point I asked mutual friends if they had heard from her. They responsed that they too had texted her and she didn't respond to them. They werent as concerned cause they arent as close but this is not typical behavior of her. I decide to text her this on April 2nd. ""Are you okay? I know sometimes you need your space but youve been completley absent from everyone and everthing and I can't help but worry. I can leave you alone if thats what you wan't but if thats the case just say so. I just need to know you're okay and tell you that I love you and have your back if for any reason you need it"" \- NO RESPONSE 

So now im freaking out. Is she suicidal? is she hurt? did her phone get shut off? Im entertaining every possibility.I decide as her friend its my responsibility to call her mom. So I do.  Her mom seems surprised by what im saying and says K was at easter the previous day and was acting just fine. That she had in fact spoken with her just the hour before I called. She said K has been working allot latley but the thing is K works at a call center. Tht would not interfere with her responding to a text. 

K has suffered from depression in the past and sometimes needs a few days to herself to think and process, but she has ALWAYS said something along the lines of "" Hey I need a few days to myself to collect my feelings if thats okay"" NEVER has she ghosted liek this. I reached out to a co\-worker and K has been going to work and acting tottaly normal. 

I have no idea how to proceed or feel 

At first i was worried/upset. Was I a badd friend, should I call her Fiance? Go to her house? 

Now, with all this information im beginning to get mad. She can't even shoot me one text that shes okay? SOMETHING? Im clearly concerned and she has no worry for how I feel. Im 6 months pregnant and shes my best friend. Maybe she hasnt needed me for the past 20 days but I needed her at times and she wasn't there.  

WHAT DO I DO? Do I just sit and wait till I hear from her? Considering Ive done all I can do? 

Do I Go to her house? Do I text her exactly how Im feeling? And when I do hear back how do I respond? 

I can't help but feel hurt and alone and helpless. Please any advice is EXTREMLY APPRECIATED.

15461,bmwyei,immentally12,I (F21) don't know what to do and I feel like I'm running out of time for my decisions,"Hello, I really need some constructive advice because my friends can't really do that.

A bit of a backstory: I'm currently living with my dad and grandma (i'm german) in our house, and it mentally drains me since my parents divorced 7 years ago. There are only issues and they keep throwing them at me, which is why I didn't so super well in school.

Right now, I'm at a university and I'm studying economics in my 2nd semester but its really nothing for me. My dad is mad at me because I dont go to uni every day and he doesn't even work himself. The thing is, i got an amazing boyfriend who lives 7h away, and it's not my first relationship and we talked realistic about our future and i'm 100% sure that it will happen. He's 18 and can't move out in the next 2 years, but he said once he goes to uni we could also move together because he will work too then.

My struggle right now is, I wanna stop studying. I don't know if it's delusional or too risky, but I plan on working a small job for a year, while I apply for an apprenticeship near his city. I don't plan on doing this for him, but also myself. I really love his city and everytime I'm there i feel alive and once I go back I start to get really depressed. My only fear is that I won't find a place for an apprenticeship, because i had to retake my last year, but my grades weren't that bad compared to the past

I really wanna move out but i feel like if I don't do this then I won't do it. It's risky but I saw I can start applying now already for next year so I could plan it out. Also, the part where I live is really small and no cities are around, so it's really hard to find a good apprenticeship here, but I really don't know if it's realistic or not, since my parents can't help me financially.

I really want to do this, because I want to start my own life somewhere else. My family constantly depends on me with their problems and over the years it just got too much for me. I feel really bad for this, but my grandma also guilt trips me everytime I go out, my dad is overprotective too and treats me like i'm 12. I need to start my own life but I'm not 100% sure yet if this is the right approach I have, but it feels right.

Thanks a lot in case someone reads this and actually gives me advice :)"

Some of who just straight up blank me no talking nothing! I don’t know if I can work my notice! And pondering wether to just walk out after talking to the big boss!

26276,8yf9v1,zoniqua,Summer is almost over and my apartment complex still hasn’t opened the pool,"As it says in the title, my apartment complex has yet to open the pool and summer is close to being over. I’ve tried asking the apartment managers about it and this has been my experience: 

I called the office early May and asked when the pool would be open, the lady told me around Memorial Day. Memorial Day passes and the pool still wasn’t open so I called again, this time the lady told me they had to paint the bottom of the pool so it would probably be early June. Around mid June the pool still wasn’t open so I decided to call again to ask when it would be, this time the lady tells me “honestly I have no idea.” Now it’s mid July and it still hasn’t opened. It’s just sitting there filled with disgusting green water with a colony of frogs living in it and they’ve yet to do anything or make any type of efforts to clean it and open it for residents.

Normally I wouldn’t be so frustrated about this but one of the reasons my roommate and I chose this specific apartment complex to move to was because it had a pool (summers here can get insanely hot). When we moved in last August the pool had already closed so we never got to swim. We were really looking forward to having somewhere to swim this summer but it’s looking like that’s not going to happen. Technically we pay to have a pool so this makes us feel like we are getting ripped off. At this point my roommate and I feel like we can’t do anything about it because our apartments haven’t made an effort to compensate or anything for it and every time we ask them they seemed annoyed by the question. Ideally it’d be nice to have a bit taken off the rent for the inconvenience but they seem rather adamant about not giving a discount. So my question is, is there anything we could do in this situation? Or should we just suck it up and take the loss?

5335,d1t00t,Throwawaytime332,I sexualize the world too much lately,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.   
I apologize in advance if the language I'll be using here is making anyone unconformable, so I marked it NSFW just for that.

I'm 32, straight male. Married +1. Been with my wife for over 9 years now.  
Like most males I usually look at other women, and until recently it was just innocent looks like ""oh she's gorgeous!"" or ""wow look at her body"", and yes, even thoughts about boobs and ass. It was always just a little thought that was over quickly, like ""wow, her ass looks amazing in those pants"", and that's it, thinking about work, video games, songs etc.

I never ever gawk at women, I never stare and behave in a not respectable way - I look and immediately look away. I have never, and never will, approach someone outright just because she's beautiful, or she has a nice ass or something. It's like eye candy of sorts, if you can call it that. Never having any feelings for that.

It's not a thing specific for women, I look at men also, but not in a sexual way. I'm just looking, you know? Like if I see a really tall guy, I think ""wow he's tall"", or a really muscular guy I think ""what will I have to do to gain these muscles? how many hours of gym"" etc. My mind's just wandering. And if a beautiful women happen to be in front of me - that's what on my mind. It's there for 5 seconds at the most and I get thinking about something else.

  
Now the troubling part:

In the past couple of months I've been noticing a change in my thought patterns. When I see a woman on the train who's ""a looker"", I find it hard to look away. I'm not staring, but every time I'm looking away, I feel the urge to look again.  
I have a girl at work, who is very beautiful, and have an amazing butt. She sits with her back to where I sit, so every time she gets up I get a look on her back side. 

I'm starting to have bad thoughts the times it happen. Like ""what if I'd just walk up behind her and grope her ass?"". Or when I was on the train recently I saw a beautiful woman and the crazy, shameful thought actually crossed my mind that ""There aren't that many people here. I guess I could grab her boobs and get away with it without causing a scene. And If she does cause a scene, the train is so empty that I will have no problem to get away"". It's starting to feel rape-y and that's a big NO for me.  


With all my interactions with women I'm always respectful, I always keep a respectable physical distance from everyone, just on the off chance that I'll make someone unconformable by being too nice. I always treat every woman I meet the same way I would like people to treat my wife. 

That's why starting to have these thoughts recently is driving my off the walls. I know that it's ok to look at women (as long as it's in a respectable, not gawking way). I know I will never, EVER treat any woman with disrespect or ever think about doing some of that stuff to anyone. But I don't know what to do with these thoughts. I (mentally) slap myself every time I get a thought like that, but I'm concerned that it's just gonna get worse with time.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice will be appreciated."
21649,9k350s,psychquestions123,How to accept the fact that you're dumb?,"So I'm reposting this since my last post was all ramble. I've been a part-time waitress for just over 6 months and it's made me realise how stupid I am. Things just go through one ear and out the other and I can't hold anything in my memory longer than a couple seconds. My boss basically wants to train me AGAIN after all this time while all the new people who came after me are doing perfect. I keep making small mistakes somehow and its brought my attention to how even outside of work I'm so dumb. It's really hard because all my self-worth came from me receiving good grades and thinking I was smart and doing well in school and university, but now I doubt that really means anything and is probably just because I work so long on my assignments etc. No matter how hard I try, I just can't fix that I'm not smart. How do I stop feeling so humiliated at work by needing training again after all this time and still not being as good as everyone else (which is the case as my boss has told me that I'm not), and accept my stupidity? Where can I derive some self-worth from? Thanks."

I just spent a day out with my wife, doing touristy things in town, discovering new things and hitting up some favorites. We got back home around 6, relaxed for a bit after walking so much, then went out to eat at a small place near our apartment.

We then went back home, and since then she's been watching Netflix, and I've been watching videos I had saved for later on YouTube. But I'm wondering if we should be doing something like going out or anything?

Over the past few years, I've become more open minded and therefor have stopped following along with their belief system. This has caused extreme tension in our relationship, and eventually caused them to say they will not help me pay for college at all, even including the price of submitting applications. I'm currently 18 years old and a high school senior planning on graduating this June. I have good grades and am in the top of my class. 

Here's my issue: Our household income is above $100,000/year, which, as far as I know, makes me ineligible for most Financial Aid and scholarships, but none of that money will help me. I know that it's almost January and I've definitely been too lazy in submitting applications for college, but I frankly don't know how to proceed from here.

16270,bj04on,pnnnto,E.R not diagnosing problems! HELP! HELP,"***Hey guys***! I'm 18 and in the last week have been experiencing severe memory loss (as much as being unable to recall much from as little a day ago, everything before then is blacked out except for bits and pieces. Like, even basic stuff like what day of the week it was yesterday takes me a minute to remember/ figure out.), balance issues, bad headaches, nausea, speech problems, vomiting, blood and mucus in poop, stiff/painful neck and disorientation to the point of it making me less functional at work and school. The E.R said that these symptoms are obviously indicative of something wrong but discharged me because the threat wasn't immediate / my vitals looked fine. The E.R couldn't find anything, though, except for a sinus infection.  But they agreed that his wouldn't cause my symptoms. Still, because my vital signs were ok, they discharged me.

This is ***getting bad***, though. I couldn't tell you where I was or what I did three days ago. I don't know. I don't immediately remember what day it is without using context clues to remember (ex: where am I currently and why?) and I keep asking customers the same things over and over at work. My coworkers notice. I'm an orphan so I'm pretty much on my own with figuring this stuff out. I'm going to schedule my first ever appointment with a Primary Care doctor tomorrow and know I probably should go back to the E.R given how rapidly my symptoms have worsened.. I've been there multiple times and all they do is check my vitals and discharge me without explanation.. Thing is, fungal meningitis (something that causes all of my symptoms) doesn't show up on the tests they've ran on me. And I have reason to believe I have a variation of it.

I stached my weed in a baggie in mud behind the garbage in my allyway where it was often exposed to dirt and rain water. I once even found ***animal poo******p*** on it's bag, once. The bag had some holes in it at times. Unhealthy stuff. Regardless, I smoked it consistently for quite a while. Contaminated cannabis has caused something called   Cryptococcal meningitis([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374632](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374632)) which is a type of fungal meningitis that is super common in places like the dirt where I left my weed. I haven't smoked in two weeks, mind you. No, I'm not *just high*. I have ample reason to believe I have any kind of meningitis, to be honest, but I couldn't explain how I contracted it without remembering that I smoked some pretty dirty weed. All of the tests that the E.R ran on me wouldn't detect something like meningitis, which is the only single thing I've been able to find online that matches my symptoms. I didn't mention the weed being in the dirty behind garbage next to feces to the E.R before because I didn't consider the weed to be relevant to my illness. I hadn't even smoked in a while. I'm afraid they won't take me seriously because I'm a drug user, too (ex: they might be hesitant to do a spinal tap on me thinking that I'm just a junkie whose looking to be sedated.) They wrote down on my file something like ""history of drug abuse"" because I said I smoked weed before :/ . Does anyone have input or advice or know what this could be?"
18358,b7oj50,superf00l,"My ex has been drunk texting me inappropriate things, should I tell my current BF?","First off, I’m a bisexual woman. For the whole last summer before I met my very serious BF, I was dating a woman. 


She had just come out of a weirdly abusive relationship with her ex and mostly just needed a good friend and to be treated right whilst dating. We had a lot of fun, a lot of laughs but obviously it didn’t last. She was still hung up on him and I decided I needed to giver her space to figure her shit out while still being her friend. We spoke on and off for a while and then lost touch before November. 


December 2nd, I first speak to my current BF. We go on two dates  and holy shit is it good. We fall in love hard and fast. We are very much in love and on the same page about everything. I’ve never felt this loved, understood or cared for and I don’t want to do ANYTHING to jeopardize this relationship. 

Now, I saw her maybe two weeks ago to pick up a DVD I left for her daughter to watch. Did that SUPER fast outside her house, just said hi, hugged and polite chit chat and then left cause it was fucking cold. She left me with the impression that she started to see that guy again and they had worked it out. I expressed good luck with that and if she ever wanted to be buds and go get coffee, make a Kwanza cake or just have someone to vent to, I’d be happy to do that. 

Last night, she messaged me drunk on insta and started talking about my appearance and her in a very inappropriate and explicit manner. 

My current BF has been cheated on before by his ex who turned out to be a lesbian. He did not handle it well. It spiraled him into reclusiveness and depression. I do NOT want to set off any of those alarms with him. I don’t want him to even think I’d consider doing anything sexual or romantic with her ever.

Should I tell him? Should I just let her drink texting slide and try to be friends? Should I just block her and continue our relationship? I still care about her as a friend and I am worried that she’s not constructively reaching out and her ex is still being shit and abusing her. But also, I love my BF deeply and we’ve planned to move in before the fall and we are talking about our retirement together.

Not sure if this is related but he is very interested in learning about Japanese culture, he's even interested in learning speaking Japanese.

I've never particularly liked myself on the whole, but I'm always trying to improve at things as much as I can. I've been going to the gym for at least twice a week for 1 year and 1/2, I try to eat healthy and in my free time I try to read science related stuff as much as I can.  I have a loving family and boyfriend, a couple of close friends, so I know I am very privileged. But lately I've been feeling like I don't deserve the life I have, and everyone around me would eventually be happier with me not existing. I'm not the most easy going person, I'm very introverted and cynical, but on the inside I care deeply for people. This is probably the only reason I haven't tried to end it all yet. I feel like everyone in the world deserves to live much more than I do, right now the only goal I want to achieve is to donate my organs to people who actually need them more than me. 

I'm trying hard to be rational and find a neurobiological explanation for all this but it's becoming more and more overwhelming and it's hard for me to find motivation to go to school, study, and not break down and cry everyday. I thought maybe it was pms, but my period has come and gone and I still feel like crying because I hate myself.

I don't think this is depression because there are still things that make me happy, like seeing my boyfriend, but even then sometimes I think he probably has better things to do than hanging out with me.

Sorry for the rant, I know this is pathetic and stupid and people have it worse, but I'm hoping maybe there's someone else who has had this appear out of nowhere; and can give me any kind of advice on how to deal with it. If anyone has read the whole text, thank you so much!"
17897,bagdjc,WhyamIstillhere2,How bad is it to have an imaginary girlfriend?,"For context: I'm a 22 year old male.

So i've been sort of mulling this over in my mind for the past few years. I've dabbled in it a little before, but never really committed to it.

Basically it just sort of happened. I've had 2 imaginary girlfriends before. Let me start of by saying, I'm not exactly in the best state mentally. Crippling depression, anxiety, maladaptive daydreaming, lots of isolation, social issues/anxiety, body/self confidence problems, have had issues with starving myself. Stay away from self harm for the most part, one near suicide attempt.

So first time it happened was my sophomore year of college. I was going through extreme anxiety issues. Like couldn't go to class, was always sick, starved myself because it, lot's of panic attacks in class, and basically anywhere and everywhere to the point where i'd be freaking out crying wondering what was wrong with me at 2 in the morning. There was an anime I had been watching. So there was a girl in it that I found cute. So i just sort of imagined her being real and with me. Well, i'd say she was more an imaginary friend the majority of the time rather than a girlfriend. I don't have friends, and my family are assholes, so she was all I had. She would listen to me, encourage me, and not judge me. She was what got me through that awful semester.

The 2nd time it happened was about 1 year ago. I was suicidal during this time. Similar to the first imaginary girlfriend I had, she was there for me, she made me happy, she motivated me to keep going and try to get better. I honestly believe that without her I wouldn't be alive today. It lasted about a month. I haven't had any since then.

So is it that bad that I have one, like full time? I'm so far behind socially that I can't even make friends, much less get a real girlfriend. I don't have the confidence to do most shit normal people do so I just honestly don't see how I could ever come close to having a meaningful relationship with someone. I know this might sound delusional, but i'd rather live in delusion than in this reality where I'm just a useless and forgotten person."

25216,941on6,additional_draft,New HS Teacher. Student trying to blackmail me.,"Throwaway for reasons.

Anyway, I'm a new HS teacher as this is my second year teaching. One of my students is the younger brother of a guy I dated in college. It didn't work out and we broke up fairly mutually. But, we dated for a while and I shared a lot of things with him. He has nudes/pics of me smoking/etc. Basically, things that the school board wouldn't like.

Anyway, after class today one of the students mentioned that he had access to nudes of me and he wanted to ""see my nipple rings IRL"" else he'd share photos of them with the other boys in the class. I don't know if he actually has photos or if he just knows of me from his brother or whatever. 

Anyway, what do?"
24212,99a2zw,linkupgraded,"I’m 16, homeschooled with no friends at all.","I’m 16 and I’ve been homeschooled ever since third grade by my mom. Ever since, I haven’t had a social life at all outside of my family and it depresses me. The only place I can ever talk to other people is at my church every Sunday in Sunday school but it’s a small group and I’m not friends with any of them because they all go to the same school and I sadly don’t so I don’t have anything to talk about with them and it just depresses me whenever I go there. I also don’t even have any activities at all either besides homeschool because of my mom being busy.

I recently went to my grandmothers church though because I’m over for the week, and they were all nice to me in that Sunday school and I made friends with them. Except I can’t go back there again because it’s too far away from my house and I didn’t add their phone numbers. This really depresses me and made me realize how badly I want a social life and what I’m missing out on. I could ask my mom for me to go to a private school, but she just got back into college herself so she can’t drive me there or anything.

So is there anything I can do at all? I feel like my entire childhood was ruined by not having any friends at all and I’m just sad and lonely. I don’t even have a dad to talk to about this and my brothers who are also homeschooled don’t even care about being social. Any help or advice would be extremely helpful thanks."

So, my boyfriend has no identification right now. He has no birth certificate, no social security card, and his ID (license) just expired last month so we don’t have that either. He has no utility bills open in his name, the only utility bill we’ve had for almost a year is the electric bill and it was in my name because I had no credit score and wanted to start building it. 

We’ve already figured out he can get his birth certificate without all the other stuff and we’re gonna order that in the next couple days with rushed delivery, so hopefully we will have it in two weeks or so. 

How do we get a social back with no ID? 
How do we get his license renewed with no utility bills? We’ve only lived in Nevada for six months so we don’t have a lot in the way of proof of residency. We currently don’t have a lease, our new apartment opens at the end of the month. I was hoping to have him on the lease as well but obviously we can’t with no ID - but without him on the lease there’s no proof of residency.

I’ve done a lot of googling with a lot of contradictory or unhelpful answers.

About 6 years ago I started experiencing some random symptoms that lasted only moments and only occurred once every few months. However about 4 years ago, those symptoms started occurring more and more frequently and with greater intensity. I didn't know it at the time but I was having anxiety related panic attacks. 

I spent almost a year trying to figure out if there was something physically wrong (because I was in denial), if I had a rare illness that the doctors just hadn't been able to identify yet. But test result after test result came back clean. 

Early 2015 the attacks had become so intense and frequent (happening daily) that I was unable to work (among other  regular daily activities) and have not yet been able to return, although I am receiving professional help for social anxiety, depression and ocd now but the progress seems minimal at best.

I feel as though I've lost my identity along with my career and friends, etc. And starting new might help and get me back to a normal life. So that I can feel like I'm contributing in some way.
And obviously financially I'm not in a great place either. 

My home life includes my wife and two kids. I exercise somewhat regularly and have recently lost 70lbs in an effort to get healthier. 

My current symptoms are what's holding me back. I struggle with public places and interactions. I have daily energy crashes where I could possibly pass out for an hour or more. I have other anxiety symptoms that will randomly present themselves including feeling like passing out, disorientation, confusion, etc. 

So I'm here now, looking for suggestions for jobs that might have flexibility, or do not require a typical 40 hour work week with normal stresses or limited human interaction and the ability to walk away for periods of time and return. I only have a high school diploma and part of a degree in psychology, I dropped out of university, unknowingly to me at the time, due to anxiety and stress. My work background is in sales and management but that's what I was doing when this all started.

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

We are all currently in our Freshmen year of high school and she has been dealing with this guy ever since they met, things have been somewhat fine, he would stalk girls at lunch, approach Jen often, say he ""got a boner around her"", write stories about her that he would read to his classes, write poems about her, draw her, and just generally be creepy, that was in middle school. Since then things have escalated, he often confesses her love for her, will stand five feet away from Jen and I watching us during our five minute break at school only saying ""Hi"" and ""Bye"" when he came and left, often asks whats she likes about me, creepily texts her constantly and is just generally incredibly stalkerish and creepy to the point where he wont leave her alone. It is aswell that he keeps a ""list"" as our class likes to call it of the people who wrong him, disrupt class or do anything he doesn't like, I believe I'm on that list. Everything has gotten to the point in which Jen and I are afraid that if we say/ do something he may hurt one of us or himself.

So one of my friends leaves her 2 cats alone in her studio apartment for multiple weeks. She will ask friends to stop by and feed the cats(yesterday was 2 weeks). She does not leave any clean litter for the people she asks to take care of them for her. I went there late on Saturday night to feed them. She lives on the 3rd floor and I could hear the cats loudly meowing from the time I hit the second floor. The cats have completely taken over. Her apartment does not have AC and reeks of feces. I had to hold my breath while I fed them and had to leave immediately because I was sure I would throw up if I smelled anymore. 

Should I say something to her or maybe the apartment building owners? We aren’t that great of friends which makes me feel like nobody else close to her will take care of her animals anymore because of this. I feel so bad for these cats. What should I do? "

On my second week, they scheduled me for an hour outside of my available time, but I said that's okay because I was still new and I thought I could compromise. For the next week, they scheduled me way outside of my availability so I told my manager and she said she'd fix it for me. And for the week after that, they not only scheduled me outside of my availability, they also put me in for all four days, instead of the three I said I could do. I feel like every week I'm fighting them about my availability and it makes me look like a difficult employee. I had thought a lot about what days and times I'll give as my availability because the workload I have from my classes is huge and I need time for that as well. I don't know what to do.

28214,8ntg9o,yasin101,I sent my teacher this apology....and now i need your advice,"So basically I dealt with abuse from my dad and I wasn't able to study to my full potential during exam time because of him so I cheated in one of my end of year mock exam and I got caught. (year 12 age 17 Britain)
I removed the details of the abuse (For example, a few days before an exam I refused to get a haircut as I wanted to study and the barbers were super busy so my dad beat me up. My nose was bleeding and i had bruises on my face and neck . I used ice for hours just so the bruises faded away) but i stated that I do get abused because I think I would still get in trouble if I didn't mention it.
I don't want want him to call social services just yet (reason why is in my comment below).

my apology:
""I'm sorry for betraying your trust. You have always been good to me and treated me well, you were there for me when I have a problem yet I have betrayed you. You were the closest father figure I could look up to and trust.
Saying sorry is not ok because I screwed up but I am Sorry for everything. Instead of opening up about my problems i disgracefully went back and added marks to the questions I wasn't allowed to write on.

I was so anxious about not displaying my best ability that I made the wrong decision and acted irrationaly and disgracefully. I am so sorry. This is the worst moment to tell you about my problems but I guess I have no choice now: I have a bad time at home. I would explain in more detail but I decided now to not disclose it. I now analysed the issue and I reckon the best solution is to stay calm and wait to leave to university and i would only report it once I have evidence otherwise it will only make things worse for me. I should have spoken up about the stuff like this that I face and just asked to retake the test with a different paper but i was so scared of what could happen so I disgustingly took advantage of the extra time.

My insecurity of  my university predicted grades, anxiety of not doing well and leaving to university made me act disgracefully. My personal problems are NOT an excuse to behave this way. I am so sorry for everything. I know Sorry is not ok because I screwed up but I'm extremely sorry and I would do anything to make up for the loss in trust and for you to forgive me. Please give me another chance to prove I truly am a good person. I'm sorry and will never dare to even say the smallest lie to anyone again. I am sorry for behaving disgracefully and letting my bottled up emotions take the best of me. I'm sorry it has come to this. I didn't mean to ruin everything. I am so sorry i let you down.""

But now I think I should send a follow up email explaining the details and the reason I don't want them to intervene (in my comment below).

What should I do? I need help, should I just email the person that he reported for me to get in trouble to instead or not? Please help me.

I have never been able to figure out what I want to do in life. In high school I picked all these random subjects because I didn’t know what could become a prerequisite for something that may have interested me. After I graduated, I took two whole years off, practically doing nothing. I like animals, so I did a short course in animal studies, but still don’t know where I want to go with that, and if that’s the right direction for me. All my friends are on their third year of uni or already finished and have full time jobs in the expertise they strived to get. But me, it’s all just one big “I don’t know.” 

I have struggled, and am still coping, with depression, anxiety, and bpd. One particular day, 2 years ago, I had decided I was going to kill myself, but due to certain circumstances, my plans were spoiled.

Since that day, I have felt even more lost. I have no sense of direction or ambition whatsoever. I am currently in some dead-end hospitality job just to pay for the alcohol that make the nights bearable. I am convinced I was supposed to end it all that day, and now that it didn’t happen, my life is just randomly generating itself, day by day, with no window with which to see through to the future... I feel like a mistake, like a glitch in life... 

What do I do and how do I overcome this sensation, how do I set myself up for the future? Any advice would help, I would greatly appreciate it."

I just started school at UC Berkeley to study environmental science. Let me start off by saying that I don’t get financial aid, so I’ll pay about 30k a year. Here’s some background on that. 
     Both of my parents were first gen college students from Mexico. They struggled through school and managed to graduate debt free. They are both teachers earning a combined income of about 120k. We live well. Great home, great food, great life. However, my mom and I are extremely frugal. So now that I’m starting school they are a bit shook from the amount we’re paying because they had never seen that, but they have faith in the investment.

     However I’m still afraid. I feel like I shouldn’t have come to Cal because of the money I’m spending. I was really desperate to go to a college far from home (SoCal) so I’m fearing I was just stupid. It’s too early for me to say I love/hate it here at cal. I’ve met amazing people. But these anxieties constantly come up. Should I have gone to community college first? Is there a cheaper school I could’ve gone to? Will the government pay more for me? Am I wasting my time?
     I know this is really long, but I’ve just kind of been rambling. The bottom line is I don’t want to make my parents pay so much, so I’ll probably take many loans. However, will I be able to pay off those loans? Will I find a job I want? Should I transfer out of Cal? I just want to feel secure, that everything will be okay. But I keep doubting that. It’s when these thoughts come in that I miss my family the most. I just want to go back home, get a job, and support them. But I know I have to think of the future as well.

 This all started because a kid in highschool got caught with inappropriate pictures on his phone so the principal expelled him from the school.

He mentions that any phone seen in the school will be taken and not given to the person until the end of the school year, keep in mind I am in a special course where since there is all of things written on board and little time, we just take pictures of the board. And the teachers are okay with it, in fact the recommend taking pictures so taking our phones would almost be like taking our notebooks, when asked about it. He said no exceptions.

 Then there was a rule where any person from the school isn't allowed to order an Uber from inside or around the school. And if they need a ride. They nice to bring a non smart Nokia phone to contact someone to call them an Uber. This is stupid since I go home by Uber since my home is very far and both my parents work all day.

31204,8aukt4,Camachan,Friend of mine is banned from Gamestop because the ASM doesn't like that she's friends with an employee. Is there any way for her to get unbanned? Or how should we handle this in general?,"No, this is not some sort of dumb situation where she loiters around the store exclusively to talk with that employee. It's that she hangs out with him as a friend, and that she gets along with him. The ban was put in place by the assistant store manager because he got angry and jealous, then cut off all friendly contact with my friend.

Some backstory:

""Sam"" and I both work at a grocery store next to a Gamestop. The employee that we talk to, let's call him Steve, has been working there a few years. They became friends a few years ago, and they've been texting, talking, hanging out ever since. 

In comes the ASM. ASM was originally a lower-level employee, but due to ""Steve"" giving recommendations, ASM was promoted to their position that they're in now sometime late last year. ASM meets ""Sam"" and develops a crush on her. They hang out, but she's not interested in dating anyone, not ASM, not ""Steve"", not anyone. ASM slowly starts to get angry ""Sam"" is spending time with ""Steve"". This eventually boils into a conflict where ASM just eventually loses it and blocks ""Sam"" on all social media and bans her from the store. ""Sam"" did nothing at the store to warrant being banned, but ASM is being extremely emotional and won't let her be in the store. ASM just doesn't seem to like ""Steve"", probably because of a love triangle that doesn't actually exist.

Throughout all of this, ""Steve"" has been extremely professional, but ASM is doing extremely petty things at work to make their life difficult. The store manager (who has been neutral and generally won't get involved) doesn't want to have ""Sam"" banned, but he is desperate to keep the ASM so he's bending over backwards for him. The District Manager also said that ""if it will avoid conflict, then she's going to be banned"". No real reason given except that ASM doesn't like her so he doesn't want her in the store, but he spun the story in such a way that apparently it will cause ""conflict"" if she comes in.

I have been sitting on the sidelines furious about everything, and it's starting to get out around my own workplace that ""Sam"" is banned from Gamestop because the ASM is mad at her. I don't know is there's anything we can do, but the closest Gamestop is almost 6 miles away in a close city. I, personally, am probably not shopping at that Gamestop unless the ban is lifted or the ASM is gone. ""Sam"" has also been an emotional wreck, so all I can really do is comfort her. 

Is there anything at all that can be done? I know this is a big stretch, but maybe certain PR representatives would find this a ridiculous reason to ban.

19166,b32a4c,fatb1tch,Am I wrong for not wanting to go to my cousin's bachelorette party?,"Long time lurker, first time poster, english is also not my first language so don't judge me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My cousin (I'll call her C) is getting married at the end of next month and she asked me to be in her bridal party. I was happy to be included since we aren't as close as we were when we were younger and when I heard she was getting married I didn't think she would ask me. C has always been a huge brat. All 'major' events in her life have to be just as major to everyone else or she has a melt down. Since the wedding planning has begun she keeps calling random brides maids 'meetings' trying to get everyone to hangout and it is not working. The bridal party just doesn't mesh as a group. If we weren't being forced to talk because of this wedding I would never be friends with any of these girls they are honestly the worst (except for 2 of the girls there are 9 of us in total). The bachelorette party is in 4 weeks and I do not want to go. C and I were extremely close as kids but now not so much. She only calls me when she wants something from me normally favors or she'd ask me to watch her kid. In recent years we've drifted because I got tired of her never answering my calls and only calling me because she needed something. I even told my girlfriend when C asked me that she probably only asked me because she needed a spot filled. The other girls in the bridal party also suck. They're rude, annoying and just not my taste. One of the girls in the group is always telling C things that the bridal party talks about privately and if C doesn't like something she'll call us all and rem us out like children. This whole process has not been fun at all and it has kind of made me hate C. Not only do i not want to go because I don't like the other girls but because its expensive! We are going to a large city about 5 hours from where we live and C is insisting we get hotel rooms instead of airbnb(which is way cheaper). For Friday-Sunday the hotel stay is 260 per person. This means we'll also have to go out for breakfast lunch and dinner every single day because we can't cook in our hotel rooms. C is also expecting us to pay for her whole entire weekend (meals, day activities, night club covers, drinks, ect..) Just this year I got a promotion and a pay raise so I have the money. BUT I do not want to spend it on her! I work hard for my money and I do not want to pay for a weekend vacation for her. One of the girls mentioned to C that she thinks this is too expensive and that she didn't want to go if it was going to be this much. C basically said that its so expensive because her stay is included, it is what it is and that she has to come regardless. This rubbed me the wrong way because C would never spend this kind of money on herself so she's forcing us to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Someone please tell me. Am I being a baby? Should I just suck it up and go and blow all my money on her? If you think I shouldn't go what excuse could I make to get out of it?

2375,dhcwuh,Roz27271,My Dad died almost a month ago and I need to make a change.,"My Dad had been sick for several years.  He had terminal liver cancer and was given 6 months in 2016.  He made it to September 2019 but succumbed to an infection.  He died quite horribly, there was no peace, no comfort...He had so many seizures that I actually hope to God it turned his brain to mush because if he was aware of his final two days and all that pain and suffering I couldn't cope.

Since he has gone I have felt so empty.  While he was sick I volunteered with a lot of stuff to keep my mind off ""what was coming"" and I loved it, it made me, but I haven't gone to anything, not even my actual work, since he passed.  During this time off I have done a lot of thinking and I feel like I need a fresh start.  I want to quit my job and use my savings and the time to sort myself out a bit, get myself in shape physically, mentally and as an employee.  Everyone says it is a really bad idea and is a knee-jerk emotional response to trying to fill a gap but the thought of going back to my job and my volunteering fills me with dread.  I want something different, I just don't know what.  I was starting to feel unhappy in my job in particular before this happened so for me it isn't a feeling that has come completely out the blue but responses from other people have suggested my gut feelings can't really be relied on given how recently I lost Dad.

What should I do?  I feel unbelievably lost.  I just want my Dad back but given that that can't happen I need something to be able to focus on, something really big.  Nothing is holding my attention, concentration is really really difficult and my mood changes almost hourly.  One thing that has been consistent though is ""I need to change something"".  Any advice or suggestions or even just similar experiences shared would be so helpful. 

Thank you."

Do I say anything to her?,"First things first, I don't want to intrude on anyone's relationships, let alone my brother's. I am merely trying to see what others would potentially do in a situation similar to mine. 

So my brother and his girlfriend have been together for a few years, and it was only until recently that he started bringing a different girl over. The first time they appeared to just be hanging out and I didn't think anything of it, why would I, he can have whatever friends he wants over. However, a few weeks went by and this same girl, the other girl, was over and I heard them having sex (caveat: I live in the apartment below my brother, with thin walls, I can, unfortunately, hear everything). Then a couple weeks went by again and the same girl (I know because of the car parked outside) was over and she spent the night, the night before his girlfriend came over to spend the night. 

So that is my situation, I was just trying to see what others would do and if there is really any advice for me in this situation. I did talk to my brother briefly saying that he should be honest with his girlfriend and that being honest is the mature and responsible thing to do."

So less than a year ago I met a girl on bumble bff and we’ve been hanging out consistently ever since. I’ve noticed that she complains when I don’t invite her places, it’s happened twice. The first time it happened was in January. I had told her on a Friday that I couldn’t make it out that night with her because I had the flu (which was 100% the truth and not a lie). The following Monday I felt a lot better after being sick for 5 days and decided to go to a local show.  She saw my snaps and began asking me really accusatory questions like. “ I thought you were sick?🧐” and “ thanks for the invite👌🏾”. Like WHAT? I was so confused, am I not allowed to invite her places. The 2nd time she did this was on Friday. She asked me last minute to go out with her and I told her I couldn’t because I had a friend’s birthday dinner. She didn’t respond until the next day and said “ Hmm so why don’t you invite me places??”. I had JUST invited her to a day-party a few weeks prior. Like Jesus... we don’t have to see each other every damn week? Is she in the wrong or am I over analyzing this? Honestly, something about this doesn’t sit well with me. I’ve never had anyone, not even a romantic interest, be this insecure about me not doing stuff with them. "
304,dsngit,WallabyJones509,"Built a gaming PC for a friend, promised payment doesn't come","The story starts off with my friend wanting a gaming PC. We talked and picked out parts for days since he's very particular. We waited for months since he had to rack up the ridiculous $1,600 this PC costed. As we waited he promised to pay me $100 to build this for him. I agreed. 

So he orders these parts and barely has enough. He has 16¢ in his bank after. He tells me he can't afford to give me the full $100 and will instead pay me $40 eventually. I wasn't happy but agreed since i would be doing something for a friend. 

The parts arrive. I come over on my day off and wanted to be gone by 11pm since I had work at 7 the following morning. That gave me a couple hours which I thought would be plenty. My friend wouldn't let me start building until his dad, (he's 19 and lives with his dad) and his sisters are upstairs. 10pm and they finally go. He's being very particular and bugging me and I tell ""him let me do my thing. Please."" I built it and was done at around 3am since he kept interrupting. 

Work the next morning was hell. He then texts me asking to borrow $10. I say no since he still hasn't paid me yet. He gets frustrated. He has me come over after work though to help swap his PC from the kitchen table, to his dad's desk. 3 more hours of my day gone, since yet again, he's very picky with everything. 2 weeks later today, he's bought LED lights, hundred dollar mouse and keyboard, and a $50 mousepad. He brags to me about his $270 paycheck for that week. I get angry and brag about my job that I get paid double what he gets, which I do. He hasn't talked to me for days now. I see on his Snapchat story that he just ordered $400 headphones. I don't understand how he's affording this stuff.

After dozens of hours of work being put into this including building, helping in picking out parts, and moving everything, I didn't get a single thing out of it. I tried forgetting about it and letting it go. But with him flexing his pc on his snap every chance he gets, it's hard. He loves it so much he stopped talking to the friend group entirely and he's always online on steam.

 I was thinking about just telling his dad what he's doing. He won't put up with it since he knows me and knows all the work I put in for this. Asking this guy isn't an option since I've tried and he makes up some excuse such as ""I don't have the money right now"". If i call him out on the bullshit excuse, I'm left on read. I already decided to never help this guy out again since he's ruined my trust in the past as well. I also will never lend him money since he clearly doesn't need it. But what do you think I should do?"

28180,8o1l83,knownsnoozy,I always feel invisible next to my gorgeous friend,"So me and my friend Nikki are both in high school right now and we live in a white community (not sure if this has anything to do with it but still). Nikki is white, blonde haired, blue eyed, has a cute dimpled smile and long lashes, has a perfect hourglass figure (big tits and ass) and overall has this innocence about her. I, on the other hand, am mixed (black and white, i often get mistaken for latina because im not dark ig? idk if that matters though), brunette, brown eyed, ive been told im very pretty but still I dont exactly have a gorgeous dimpled smile or long lashes, I have the same body type as nicki except my waist is not as defined bc she waist trains. Also we're both very short, im 5'1 and shes 4'11ish. Anyway whenever we are around guys, even total strangers we've never spoken to, its like shes the only one in the room and they are all over her. I've had numerous people tell me how gorgeous and attractive she is including one of my guy friends who once called me fat (Me and nicki are the same size too). I can normally ignore all the guys flocking to her, but literally every guy I've been interested in at my school, have all only noticed her and stared her down while I remained invisible. She could have anyone she wants and shes unaware of how attractive she is. Hell, I disappear everytime any boy speaks to us and our friends rated us once and put her at a 9-10/10 while I was a 7-8/10. Literally a guy I liked  stared  her down when she came running in and when she left and he's never done that with me and is never engaged w me. All the boys ive wanted constantly fight for her attention while im just the other one. She can get random boys to do stuff for her at the drop of a hat, literally guys she hardly knows. It hurts constantly knowing that when people look at us their focus is always on her, I'm just there, or not even seen at all. I hate letting jealousy consume me because she is an awesome friend to have in my life, but I feel like I'll never be the one anyone sees, it will always be her."
29757,8fokat,MemeQueen92,Jealous of an old friend?,"I'm overweight and I'm working to get healthy. I eat healthy and exercise several days a week. My former friend used to be much bigger than I am at the moment. She lost weight and her behavior changed. She became very nasty. Her and I ended up having a toxic friendship and one of the reasons was because her boyfriend (who is really more of a FWB) was hitting on me on Snapchat in front of her. She said it was all my fault even though I apologized. He denied he did anything wrong. I think he's probably not being faithful to her, but anyway I tried being this woman's friend. I tried talking to her, even tried making plans with her and she always made up excuses to not hang out with me. 

I feel like she's more popular than me. On Instagram she just follows a lot of celebrity accounts. Her page is open so anyone can see her photos and she gets 10+ likes on her photos compared to me. But I think a lot of her ""likes"" come from random people. When we had a fight when she made comments about a guy I was dating at the time, I said something and she said I was fat and looked like a boy while she was thin and beautiful. I'm feeling insecure even though I'm trying to live a healthy lifestyle. She blocked me on Facebook without warning and doesn't follow me on Instagram anymore. All she does is use Snapchat all day and then complains she's bored. 

How do I stop being jealous? I don't know why I'm so jealous. I feel like I'm competing with her."

About a year a half ago I move into my house. First house ever. Sweet. Met my neighbors one of them, I'll call him Steve. Awesome guy, really chill, we help each other out all neighborly like. My other neighbor, I'll call him Steve seems like a pretty chill dude. Keeps to himself like rock, doesn't mind the occasional small drunken gathering I have at my abode. 

One day Steve and I are talking because I had to return some of his mail misplaced in my mailbox. He tells me he is deploying (we spoke earlier about him being in the reserves). I'm a former Marine, wish him the best of luck and tell him if he needs me to help watch his house or take care of his doggo to let me know. 

Flash forward to about 8 months ago, post office fucks up. It's a letter from him to his GF... From the state prison. 

I have some resources at my disposal and I'm more nosy than I should be. I feel like I have a right to know if my neighbor is a murder or some shit. Turns out he is in jail for soliciting a minor... Thank God I don't have kids.

I'm pretty pissed because I wouldn't have cared as much if he said ""I'm going to jail."" But he said he was deploying.

Well, the contract ended a while ago and I now unemployed for several months. I feel like my chances of ever getting a ""good"" job are slipping further and further away the longer I remain unemployed. (I'm talking 'entry-level' jobs, not C-suite jobs; I just want something that has more room for growth than 'assistant night shift manager') To make things worse, I screwed up in college, had an existential crisis my senior year and WRECKED my GPA so grad school is out of the picture (even if my grades were better, I'd still not be able to pay for grad school).

I spend a lot of time beating myself up for letting my life get to this place. I hate everything about myself and want desperately to get a job I can be proud of so that I can actually answer the question ""so what do you do?"" without being evasive or admitting that I'm an unemployed degenerate.

I feel super-entitled whining how I can't get a 'good' job, like I expect everything handed to me on a silver platter. However, my brother and several friends from high school and college have flashy, prestigious jobs and I feel like a fucking failure every day.

I've tried finding more friends to hang out with but everyone in this town is a huge stoner. It's become more than just something fun to do, more than just a hobby, it is now a necessity for not only my friends, but almost everyone I know. I have big dreams. I do not want to smoke weed all the time, do fuck-all and end up in some dead-end trade and live the rest of my life in this town or around here like so many others have done.

25641,91lmrx,xaevus,I’m 24 and yesterday I had my first kiss ever.,"We actually made out, actually basically dry fucked on her sofa, it was pretty heated actually... we kissed/touched/grinded for over 2 hours until we had to stop because she’s with someone else. Anyway I’m just happy it happened with someone I trust (she’s a close friend). 

The reason why it never happened before was basically I weighed 240 pounds (110 kilos) and was fat my whole childhood/early adulthood and in the past 2-3 years I got sick of it and lost 100 pounds (45 kilos); I’m about 145 pounds/65 kilos now, bought new classy clothes, grew a decently attractive beard and generally some girls at work even tell me I’m attractive, which I don’t want to believe because I think I still see myself as I always have, fat, gross, not horribly ugly but simply too blubby and definitely not boyfriend material. 

My friend who I kissed said that she was surprised by actually how natural and not forced it was, and the whole evening was actually super hot and she was really getting crazy. She knew it was my first time but she couldn’t let us fuck because she’s with someone else and I respect that.

My question is, am I a loser for being born in 1994 and only opening up/blooming now? I feel like I don’t really care but at the same time I feel like I need some closure; for the longest time I was in denial and insisted I don’t need a girlfriend because relationships and even just sex is complicated (to justify not having sex or even kissing anyone, the truth being I was overweight/obese and insecure). But now that I’m in good shape, idk maybe it’s the hormones or tesosterone but I feel like it’s natural and I need this. Maybe I’m just maturing (probably?). I think I’m just overthinking due to having a different mindset all my life. Not sure if I should be happy finally my life is changing for the better or depressed it took so long and I “wasted” so many years..

He is a compulsive liar and serious narcissist. But I was young and stupid so I ended up staying around through the lying and the cheating during this time whenever I would catch him talking to another female or doing anything that resemble cheating I would reach out to her and let her know that he was in a relationship because most of the time they had no idea there were no pictures of us anywhere on the internet he wouldn't accept a relationship request on Facebook we didn't really go out together with friends none of that so I thought it ​​was my job to let them know that he was in a relationship and majority of them ended up not speaking to him ever again or they j​​ust felt completely different about him after the fact towards the last year or so of our relationship I would say probably around 2016 he went out of state to visit one of his guy friends a few times I didn't really think anything of it but he was basically arranging plans to move out of state and he didn't really tell me about it during the visits he was obviously cheating on me with random chicks and it became apparent to me that one chick in particular kept coming up she became friends with him on social media was liking all his stuff and even tagged him in a photo of her. I ended up finding out that he was sleeping with her when he would go out there because I tricked him into thinking she already told me. I contacted her and the situation was a little bit different she was not compliant at all she didn't care that he had a girlfriend she didn't want to talk to me and she basically said I was crazy and wrote off the entire situation.  he eventually moved out of state to the place that he was visiting the place also the town she lives in and his friend lives. to this day they're still seeing each other because they still following eachother like eachothers stuff and some times she posts things from the same place he posts things. I mean they're not in a relationship on Facebook they don't have any pictures together it's not obvious at all which is just kind of his style so I know what he is on. Fast forward to now I have since realize how insane and immature I was throughout that relationship it's embarrassing. I'm in a happy healthy relationship with somebody who isnt a piece of s***we live together and I could definitely see us getting married in the near future. The problem is for some reason till this day I still look up that girl on social media and practically stalk the internet trying to find information about her I don't know why I'm so obsessed with this chick I don't know if it's the fact that she was the one chick that I couldn't convince to hate him for the piece of s*** he was or what because looking back and looking at him I don't even know how I was attracted to him I have literally no feelings for him whatsoever so I don't know why I constantly feel the need to compare myself to this chick because at the end of the day she won her prize she got him and that's a real s***** prize that I'm not trying to have and I'm happy now with someone else.

Over the past few weeks a lot of my family members and friends have reached out to me about my workload. They're worried that I'm going to burnout and that'll affect my grades and my mental health. 

So what do I do? Cut back? On what? How to I cope with cutting back on something I love? If not how do I assure my loved ones that I'm okay? And most importantly, how do I make sure that I take care of me with this schedule."

9452,cghidy,camelstrider,Help boyfriend issues??,My current boyfriend is best friends with his ex girlfriend. At times I feel like she’s more of a priority or more important in his life. He relates me to her all the time (as well as her current boyfriend) and it makes me feel like he doesn’t think about the things we’ve done together or she’s always first into his mind before me. He is super comfortable around her and that bothers me. He constantly tries for me to be her best friend when I don’t think I can fathom that. In the past he’s given me an ultimatum between me and her. I’d either have to suck it up or leave if I couldn’t handle it; after telling him how it bothered me and made me feel. And at this point it’s just gotten worse and more weight on my chest. I’m not sure what to do :(

39263,7k82vt,needhelpformyfamily,My(30M) Sister(28F) avoids our baby brother(17M) because he looks like our Step-Dad.,"My sister and I were from our mom's first marriage. She remarried when I was 7 and my sister was five, to a guy she'd been dating for a couple of years. When I was 12, our mom told us she was pregnant, and everyone was cool with it, except my sister. Not long after, my sister told a counselor at school that my step-dad was raping her at night.

It turned into a full investigation, where it was eventually proven that he was (she had a ton of scars and stuff apparently, and our stepdad had pictures of her on his computer). He got arrested, and went to jail, and died there. My mom divorced him as soon as he got accused, but kept the baby. For years, our sister has had no problem with our little brother, and he looks up to her for a lot of things. 

In the last six months or so, my brother has hit another growth spurt, and gone from ""mid-puberty kid"" to ""looks like fully grown adult man growing full facial hair etc"". He's also gone from ""looking like a kid"" to looking like a carbon copy of our step-dad. 

My sister knows that our brother didn't DO anything, but it apparently makes her uncomfortable to be around our brother now. So she made the decision to go spend Christmas with her husband's family rather than ours, while she's starting up therapy again, because she thought she was past this. 

Our brother is really upset, because no one has told him why our sister is avoiding him. Mom absolutely forbids us from telling him, because then he might find out what his dad did to our sister, and she has prevented anyone from telling him his entire life. As far as he knows, his dad got caught doing drugs and died in jail.

He's taking our sister's sudden coldness really badly, and my sister and I think he should be told why, so that he knows it's nothing to do with him. But Mom insists he not know, and is flipping out at the idea that someone might tell ""her baby"".

It's causing a lot of family drama, and my mom's never been the most level-headed person. So, I guess I'm looking for advice, not just on how I should handle this situation, but what I can do to help my family as a whole."
26385,8xsb66,throwinginthedeeep,"UPDATE: ""Boyfriend (20M) cheating? Anybody know Polish?""","The old story:

So heres an old post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8vf1ki/boyfriend\_20m\_cheating\_anybody\_know\_polish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8vf1ki/boyfriend_20m_cheating_anybody_know_polish/)

of me asking if anyone could help me out translating my boyfriends messages because i thought he might be cheating. and just... wow... I checked on the post the next day and it had 2 responses, so I just left it alone after that not checking again until now (1 week later). I want to thank  [raygarraty47](https://www.reddit.com/user/raygarraty47) and  [Morex\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Morex_) especially for putting in all that work translating everything, thank you so much!

The update:

Not knowing the whole translation yet, and only going by the ""I love you"" message he send her, I waited for him to wake up from his alarm clock at 7, not having slept all night, and told him to tell me everything. Well he didn't lie, he told me he was in love with this female friend of his, and that he told her last night, but she didn't like him back, she liked his friend (who in turn didn't like her). I asked him if he still loved me, and he said no. So that evening when meeting him after a busy day and thinking about it, I broke things off. It was incredibly painful and I pretty much died from sadness, after some talking he started crying as well, and told me he did still love me, he was just trying to suppress it because I had been homesick for my country and talked a lot about going back and he couldn't bear losing me.  But he was right, I did wanna go back, so despite that we stayed broken up. 4 days ago I moved out of his apartment into a little empty dorm room a super sweet girl is lending me now that she's home for the summer. And my mom will picking me up next Sunday to take the long drive back home.

Reading the translated messages now, it's odd, but comforting. There's nothing new in there he was still hiding from me, except just how in love he is with this girl, I'm pretty sure she was supposed to be some sort of ""replacement"" for when I would leave, he either denies this, or doesn't realize where his own feelings come from. We're parting on good terms, although it still hurts a lot. I understand you cannot control what you feel (although I'm concerned that If she would've liked him, he might've started full blown cheating. But there's no use worrying about that now). And I also understand I shouldn't have told him of my plans to leave without actually going through with it, leaving him in that uncertainty. 

So that's where I am, heartbroken and lonely until the moment my mom picks me up, when I will just be heartbroken. But also with this whole issue behind me, and a new life ahead in the country I love with my family and friends.

Again, Thankyou!"

38465,7mng4f,[deleted],My ex sister-in-law (31F) just died after a short fight against cancer. I want to express my condolences to my ex husband and in-laws in an appropriate and non-intrusive manner,"I found out tonight that my ex-SIL (“Rachel”) has died after fighting a short battle with cancer.  The only information I have about this is from public Facebook posts, as I’m not in contact with any of my ex-husband’s (“Mike”) family.  

I’m more upset about Rachel’s death than I thought I would be, given that it’s been fairly clear for the last few months that the cancer was aggressive and terminal.  I thought I’d come to terms with her dying but since I found out she has died I’ve felt a compulsion to reach out in some way to Mike, my ex-MIL (“Betty”), and my ex-FIL (“Larry”).


#Backstory

I’ve been divorced from Mike for over 3 years after being together for 7.  Our divorce was not amicable.  Mike and I have no children together.  We have both remarried in the last year. 

I have not spoken to Rachel, Betty, or Larry in over 3 years.  We were never close.  I would have liked them fine if they were just acquaintances but found them grating as in-laws.  In the last year I’ve realized that my not liking them had more to do with my unhappy marriage than it did with Rachel, Betty, or Larry.

When Mike’s beloved grandmother died last year I sent him a short email saying that I was sorry, that she was a wonderful lady, and that I’m glad he was able to be with her at the end.  I expected that email to be ignored but he responded with “Thank you”.  Because I contacted him about his grandmother’s death I don’t think it would be a shock if I contact him about his sister’s.


#How to reach out?

Betty and Larry still live in Mike’s hometown, halfway across the country from both of us.  Rachel lived there too.  If they lived within a few hours of me I’d likely attend the funeral but they don’t.

I don’t want to call Mike, Betty, or Larry and texting feels intrusive to me.  Mike has moved and I don’t think I have his current address.  I could probably get it from our mutual friends but I think his new wife probably wouldn’t appreciate that and maybe email is a better way to communicate with him. 

For Betty and Larry I was thinking about mailing a card along with a thumb drive of all of the pictures I have of Rachel.  I’ve never met Rachel’s new husband (“Sam”), they met after my divorce, and don’t have any way to contact him directly except Facebook which I think would be creepy.

The issue with the pictures is that a lot of them include me and a number are from Mike and my engagement or wedding.  I think Betty and Sam will want any picture anyone has of Rachel, but I don’t want to be perceived as being inappropriate or not respecting Mike’s new wife.  I was thinking of enclosing a note with the pictures apologizing for the provenance of some of them and explaining I didn’t want to leave any of the photos I had out.  I was not planning on sending the pictures to Mike.  

I do not want to post the pictures to Facebook or any social media because I don’t want to send them for attention.  I just feel like it’s a small thing I can do for Betty, Larry, and Sam.  For some reason the idea of sending them a link to download the pictures feels inappropriate to me, and it would likely just confuse Betty.

Should I send an email to Mike?  The card &amp; thumb-drive of pictures to Betty and Larry?  Do I send anything to Sam, through Betty and Larry?  What do I say to any/all of them?


#TL;DR;

My ex SIL just died at 31 of an aggressive cancer.  I want to express my condolences to my ex husband, MIL, and FIL.  I am considering sending my ex MIL a thumb drive of all of the pictures I have of ex SIL but I’m in a number of those pictures and I’m not sure if it’s appropriate."

I know that I only need the certification. While they postpone the program cost until your first year there is still a $300-400 cost to enroll. I don't have this money. I was recently kicked out and had to hunker down at my saint of grandma. I don't have a car either. I don't know how to get this money to get me moving forward. It's been 3 years since I graduated.

Im now living a 15 minute drive from a town with no vehicle, my only web access is my phone (until it's cut off), and I don't know what to do. I just hope maybe someone has advice or even encouragement on how I can scrounge up the cash for this program. It's all I've ever wanted but I let the jerks in my family shame me out of it.

The owner is a family friend and offered me the chance to take over when he retires in 5 years.   Well the position offers double what im making currently,  car allowance, benefits,  401k and a better quality of life.  My wife and I agree that not taking this chance would be a mistake.  

I told my in laws and they took it ok but my sister in law,  who I work with,  is no longer talking to my wife or I.  The family narrative is that she must now save the firm because of my selfish actions.  This was not the case when there one son left 2 years ago, not when my SIL took a 6 month sabbatical and I was saddled with their work.   My wife is very upset and feels like they ate isolating her.

i’m 17 and going to college next year and so i have an issue with my parents i don’t have the best relationship with them so i don’t have like conversations or anything with them we just kinda only talk about serious normal family stuff. my dad has had many problems with me and so has my mom with my life and everything, so i specifically have one major thing where i’m gay but i have no idea how to express this to them. i told my mom last summer and she completely bashed it and told me it’s because i hang out with girls so much (all of my friends are girls because i used to get bullied by boys so i just stuck to girls cuz it made me feel safer) and they changed me, my family will hate me, these feelings will go away, i’m a disgrace, and yeah. she made me really upset and i have mental health issues already so this lead to a suicide attempt which was stopped by my own thoughts. ever since then she’s been trying to get me out of hanging out with girls and has been bullying me about it telling me to stop acting like a fag and picks on me constantly. with my dad i didn’t even bother to tell because he’s super right wing and hates all lgbt stuff and refuses to see my mom at work when her gay coworker is working. he constantly bashes gay people in front of me and expects me to do the same, and wants me to be shaped to be the man he wants me to be. i constantly worry that i will never be able to express myself truly with them and i am afraid this will lead to me being disowned, even though they claim they love me as their only child no matter what, i think this is a limit they never even saw coming. so my main question is, what should i do about this and how do i even tell them? my parents aren’t even convinced it’s a choice and they are completely ignorant with the topic as my mom claims she’s right with everything.

TLDR: i don’t really have a friendly relationship with my parents and they are just there as my parents, both are extremely homophobic and do not understand the premise of being gay whatsoever, how should i express myself to them if i am already shy to talk to them about even minute issues? 

-also, if my relationship with my parents isn’t clear: i don’t talk to them about anything unless they come to me first and our conversations don’t last longer than a few minutes. they barely know about my personal life and i don’t tell them anything because i just don’t feel comfortable. however, i do depend on them for a lot and i am grateful for all they have provided me."

He called my direct boss girl names in front of me and kind of bragged about how drunk everyone got at the last 'company event'. He did this in a funny way and in general made a lot of jokes, so maybe I am just overreacting. But I got the feeling that he is the kind of persons who always makes sure, that everybody knows, that he is the most important guy in the room.

I have a feeling it is definitely more of a business casual type of work environment, but my dad recommended that I wear a suit for the interview. The only problem is that the only suit I have available to me right now is my dad's suit which is a little big. The jacket fits ok, but the shoulders are padded and the slacks are quite baggy, like 1990's baggy. That's why I was thinking that I'd just wear what I normally wear which is an oxford cloth button up with khaki pants and red wing boots.

It’s important that I learn discretion because of a relationship I want to be in. This is for two reasons, this person is a co-worker and we shouldn’t have feeling for each other. Second this person would prefer a more private relationship outside the confines of our friendships we share with other people. Also I feel like i’ve Shared so much already till this point so am I just fucked?

I want to be independent and not such a big mouth but I can’t help but seek people for advice about all facets of my life.

If I apply for a job, I most cases get a phone interview or whatever their initial interview is. But somewhere along their I just blow it.

I know the market can be tough, but it has happened so many times it can't be that someone else always did slightly better or will take slightly less money.

I'm talking years and dozens of interviews. Occasionally I walk out and smack myself in the face because I realize I've done something boneheaded, but sometimes I think I've done great and I get a rejection. At least half of the rejections I get say that they aren't moving forward with the position any longer, so I can't even ask for feedback as to why I didn't get the job, but then without fail I checked LinkedIn and they hired someone else. 

A few months ago a company I had done some business with contacted me. Pursued me, brought me in for several interviews, made a very casual verbal offer, asked when I could start, had me meet nearly everyone there, and then I never heard from them again. I'm quite sure these things happen, but it just KEEPS happening to me I have to think that I'm the common denominator. I send a polite and not demanding follow up email, and usually it's ignored. 

Am I horrible? I think I'm confident yet modest, I can sometimes be way too chatty but I have really worked on that and I'm more precise with my words, I try to be funny but not make anyone laugh (like a light humor not joke telling).

I have an interview tomorrow and I want the job so FREAKING bad. They reached out to me on LinkedIn so I know my background fits. I had a long phone interview with the recruiter and filled out a lengthy (like took an hour), and landed the in person interview but I want to know what thing I could be doing that is preventing me from getting jobs.

I'm hoping you'll have some tips that light up something in my head I've been doing wrong, or ask a question that makes me realize the error of my ways. HELP and super thank you "

I feel like my problems are not something I can talk about. I am successful, I have a wonderful husband, I’m financially stable, and I have a loving local group of friends and family. However I have problems that I either feel people cannot relate to or that I have to keep secret.

My former best friend and I experienced a falling out, and now I am dealing with the feelings of rejection and a lingering distrust of any potential friends. I am ready to try for a baby, but the timing is off right now. On top of that I’m nervous that I’m going to have trouble conceiving, and I am not ok with telling people that I even want a kid, let alone that I worry about my fertility. I have a hard time emotionally with the weight that sits on my shoulders as the primary breadwinner in the family. My husband works and goes to school, but he doesn’t make enough money to contribute very much to our household finances. At the moment my husband doesn’t have any higher paying job prospects, and my elderly parents are so financially strapped that they are borrowing money from me. I feel the pressure of the heavy expectations of me at work, especially since I recently decided to drop out of a potentially lucrative business venture (which I have to keep secret, due to the nature of my job, word spreading would certainly get me fired). Small things are starting to upset me more easily than they should, and I assume it’s because I’ve bottled up everything going on in my life. I saw my friend’s newborn baby today, and it reminded me just how frustrated I am with my life and myself. I had a few other little things go wrong at work (things that I would normally laugh off) and I was so upset that I cried on my drive home from work (I don’t cry easily).

18355,b7pfmu,Gllim,My brother (17) and I (20) are uneducated and suffer from mental health issues. I have no idea what to do.,"Hello. I know the title is kind of weird but I just want to say that this is my first time ever posting, and I'm really scared to do this, so I apologize in advance for how long it is and for any errors.

So, I feel like I have to give some backstory for this to make more sense. I'll try to put a TL;DR at the end.

I grew up in a small town in the midwest. It's just me, my parents and my little brother. We never really had a lot of money so our father was working most of the time, and both my brother and I were homeschooled.

Although, my mother's idea of homeschooling might seem very different from most. She only ever taught us how to read and write (my brother didn't learn to read and write until he was about 9 or 10 years old) and some very basic math skills. 99% of the time she would start our school with buying a bunch of supplies, have us do math and spelling problems she got from a book or printed out, read to us; usually Little House on the Prairie, and then answer questions to make sure we were paying attention.

This was on and off during the early years of our childhood. Our schooling would last anywhere from 1-2 weeks or a month. Eventually, she would stop and we could go months or on some occasions over a year before she picked it back up again.

We never went to those homeschooling group functions, we never really got to interact with any other kids. In fact, we hardly ever left the house at all.

Our parents are homebodies and they don't like to leave the house. My father worked all day, came home got on the computer and played games then went to bed. If my mother wasn't teaching us, she either watched tv or was on the computer. We were very close to some cousins who lived nearby and would go over to play with them, but for the most part, it was always just me and my brother.

The problem with this was that I hated him.

My mother was very emotionally hurtful and passive-aggressive. She still is to some degree.
She would tell me that I could talk to her about anything and then if I said something she didn't agree with she would scream at me, calling me an ungrateful brat who doesn't deserve anything. She also very obviously favorited my brother more.

He could do no wrong. If he did do something bad I had to get punished too because I had provoked him in some way. He could do whatever he wanted because he was ""just a baby who doesn't know any better"".

She got the whole family to tease me about my appearance and call me names, and when I would cry and say that it hurt my feelings she would laugh and tell everyone that they couldn't joke with me anymore because I was too soft and couldn't handle it.

Our father spanked us hard enough to leave red welts and sometimes our mother threatened to beat the shit out of me or put me up for adoption.

I eventually stopped talking to anyone about my personal problems. I've never had a friend to talk to or a family member that I could trust. It feels like we grew up isolated from the outside world and I had no way to safely express my anger and sadness.

Between the ages of 8 to 11, my mental health started tanking, my personality did a 180 and I think developed anxiety and depression.
The entirety of my teenage years I did nothing. My hobbies didn't bring my joy anymore, I stopped caring about how I looked because I was convinced that I was a worthless waste of human life and that I would never have any friends or someone to love. I kinda feel like I zoned out mentally for a decade and am only just now starting to wake up and realize just how much I fucked everything up.

I was, however, able to make amends with my brother. I suppose I didn't really hate him, I just felt like it was always a competition for our mothers love and I would never be as good as him.

We cried and hugged and for the first time I didn't feel so alone.

Our mother changed over the years as well and she isn't as aggressive anymore.

She's basically one of those crystal healing essential oil Facebook women you always hear about. She thinks she's an empath who can talk to her angels or whatever and believes doctors are only in it for the money and that vaccines cause autism.

I am 20 years old and my brother will be 18 in April. I can see now just how fucked up my brother is and that he is starting to go down the same road as me.
I told him that we were going to start working on our health and education together so we won't be alone and it's not as scary. We both have little to no skills whatsoever.

I have such crippling anxiety though when it comes to going outside and interacting with people. Last year I stopped going to the grocery store with my family, and I could probably count on one hand the number of times I left the property because I didn't want to be seen or heard. I don't even comment or talk to people in games or online because I'm terrified of sounding foolish or hurting someone's feelings.

My brother is desperate to get a job and move out of the house.
He is extremely angry and depressed and thinks that there is no hope for us. I told him that it would be okay and that I would take care of teaching the both of us and that I was here for him when he needs to vent. I told him that we would get a job and move out and have friends and that there were people out there who got better and now have a good life.

But I have no idea where to start or what to do.
We are so behind everyone else in everything, and I'm overwhelmed with how much we need to learn before next year to prepare for work and college.
All this doesn't even scratch the surface of what's wrong with us, and I know we probably need some medication and therapy but that is not going to happen any time soon.

I'm terrified.
I know I should have started years ago. I know it's my fault and I should have taken responsibility as the older sister when I realized that our mother was not going to teach us anymore.
I should have had a job by now and be in college already but I was too lazy.
I have no idea about being an adult. I'm going to be 21 this year and I've felt like I've done absolutely nothing to grow as a person.

We are particularly bad at math, we know virtually nothing about history or science or how the world works. What little we do know we have taught ourselves.
I guess what I'm asking is if anyone else was ever in a similar position as us?
Can anyone at least recommend some websites or even youtube videos to help us learn? 
Advice?
Our mother says we don't need a GED to get into college. That she just has to make a list of all the things she taught us and then and we take a test and they'll let us in, but I'm not convinced.
We need vaccines, but we need to sneak and get them while we're out shopping as that's the only time we leave the house.
We currently live in Florida out in the middle of nowhere, so our job and college options are very limited. I would be willing to walk or get an uber or something but our parents don't trust other people and would never go for that.

I know this is really pathetic and I probably sound like those neckbeard incel guys what with living at home with no skills and no job or degree, but I have to start no matter how fucking scared I am. I know it will be very difficult and we'll probably fail a lot in college but we just have to get over that first jump.

I know our parents love us as best they can. They both had horrible childhoods and they provided us with everything they could, buying us toys and treats if they could afford it.

Half of me is still incredibly angry and bitter at my parents and what my life has become. That I let myself and my brother get so bad.
The other half of me feels like they didn't mean to do those things. They really are good people deep down just doing the best they can and I feel like a horrible guilty person for still having these feelings when I know I should get over them and move on.

I feel like I can't function like a normal person. I feel like I can't get rid of this baggage holding me down, and if I can't then I won't be able to help my brother.

Again,  I'm sorry for this vague jumbled wall of text.

TL;DR: My brother and I have severe mental health issues with nobody to turn to for help. We received little to no education or guidance as children and are currently living in our parent's house with about a year to catch up on everything so we can get a job and go to college. Any advice?

3883,d9d4xt,kindaspeachy,Not sure on how to process this situation and it’s making my brain explode.,"Hello! So I’m going to try and make this as short as possible but I’d really love any feedback/advice/hopeful words.

So I moved states over two times in the year two past year. My hometown was pretty okay but I guess I didn’t realize it when I was there. Finally I found a stable home with my boyfriend and things have been pretty good. I had one really close friend here and they really helped me get out of the deepest hole I was in. Recently they’ve completely cut ties with me since his girlfriend thought some fucked up shit, ya know the entire jealous/insecure mindset. (She ended up saying a lot of shit about me, my family who she’s never even met, and my boyfriend.)

He ended up breaking up with her then getting back together with her a good  amount of times and each time they got together he would dodge me completely, which really pissed me off since I was the only one he would dodge (he’d answer my boyfriend lmao). So it got to a point where I tried talking to him and letting him know that the shit was dumb and just treat me like normal. I guess he didn’t agree and got tired of me or whatever and cut me off. He blocked me and I deleted him on other socials since I didn’t want to see anything of him and now it just really sucks. I don’t really have any other close friends at all and he was the only friend I felt like I could get along with and not feel anxious around like my other friends, he was a brother to me at this point. Because of all of this I’ve just felt completely alone and I guess I have an issue with cutting people off. I feel like him as well as other friends I’ve tried getting along with are just judging me now. I want to know what I did wrong within the situation but he won’t even tell me. 

At this point it’s just increased my depression and anxiety completely. I feel so low of myself and honestly I think about just ending it every night. I have my boyfriend but he doesn’t really understand how I’m feeling even though I’ve tried to explain it multiple times and all that. Any advice on how to get out of this feeing, just not feeing worthless since I don’t even hear from any of my friends I had now. Anything anyone says is welcomed and if anyone wants to know more details to understand better I’m glad to clear it up. Sorry for all this being long still haha, I’m not great at making long stories shirt. 

thanks again guys"

We have a friend group of around 10 people, and every other weekend or so we hang out and drink. It's worth noting that every time we do this it's typically around 6-8 of us, and there's 2-3 designated sober people. I have my own personal issues with Alcohol, so I always choose to remain sober. Our friend group is very open with each other, but we all have our own pent up problems, and whenever we drink those problems come out. It always ends with several hours of crying, being sad, and exhaustion. Last night I laid in bed with my friend for 3 hours trying to console her while she cried about her childhood trauma and how she hates herself and feels unloved, while my other sober friend consoled her drunk crying roommate who was dealing with her own insecurities. At the end of it all the two drunk girls left in the morning feeling fine, the only other sober person left  around 4 in the morning and came back crying from feeling overwhelmed at noon. I love my friends, and I want to hear their issues and help them work through them, but I feel like them getting drunk and crying for hours and just ignoring it in the morning is unhealthy.

When she finally got home she came in my room and told me that she was going to spend a few days with her mother and then went and told my brother the same thing. She never came back, refusing to step foot in the house.

It was a very messy split, she tried to blame everything on my father, that it was all his fault, (there are a lot of details to add in about home life that I would include but are wayyy too much to add) when it comes out that she had been cheating.

Cut to three weeks later, she’s moving into an apartment with her girlfriend. She has no contact with my brother or me. About 2 months after she moved out, she slowly gets in more contact with us and I moved in with her because I’m dumb. 3 months later I moved back in with my father because her girlfriend was verbally abusive to me, an alcoholic, a hot head, and in general, a type of person I don’t like or get along with.

So it’s been about a year since I moved out of my mom’s, and a year and a half since she left.

A couple of weeks ago, all four of us each had to give a 15 minute presentation about a recent project we have been working on to the movers and shakers of this company. Probably a total of 15 people who all of which can make or break my career with their influence. I thought the presentation went great, and my boss called me after to let me know that I did very well (my boss is a down to earth guy who I like). Fast forward to last week. My boss comes into the office (usually works remotely) and asks to grab lunch. Lunch goes great, but right when we are finishing, he goes “hey specialk, I just wanna let you know someone called me to complain that you were making fun of “Rachel”(fake name, but new girl who started with me- I objectively have no problems with her)” I was pretty surprised and said that there must be some confusion as I certainly haven’t said anything of the like. He responded that it wasn’t anything I said, but rather my body language and eye contact with my friend, the other guy that started a year before. My boss went on to say that he was perplexed and that he didn’t see anything in the meeting and just suggested I be cognizant of how sensitive some people are. I agreed and apologize. I thought all was fine. Now this week, my mentor (a 30yr veteran acct manager.) took me out for lunch and basically was like “hey you need to be careful about how you look during meetings because their are some bad optics with you right now”. 

So here is the thing- I genuinely didnt try in anyway to make fun of this lady. I called my friend after work today and asked him if I did anything and he said absolutely not and said this is absurd. Additionally, this wasn’t a formal meeting. There was a TON of joking going on the entire hour and I’m certain everyone in the room laughed at some point in the hour. 

Basically I’m a little peeved that I am being accused of something that I cannot prove I didn’t do (I don’t know how to prove my eyes weren’t making fun of her?) , and I guess I’m looking for advice as to how to mitigate this damage?  I have had two 1-1 meetings with the girl I supposedly made fun of , and she certainly does not seem to have any hard feelings."

1254,dmuioa,pi-taya,I slept with a co-worker and found out I don't know him as well as I thought. How can I handle this?,"Throwaway account since he's on Reddit often.

I recently started a new job where I'm making significantly more money than I used to and enjoying myself much more. I have fantastic coworkers and have struck up friendships with quite a few of them. However, one of my co-workers I connected with very quickly. I'll skip the gory details, but we got along like we'd known each other for ages and I got a little starstruck. We ended up hanging out outside of work a few times and about two weeks ago, things escalated and we ended up sleeping together. I was initially a little mortified that I had slept with a co-worker, but we talked about what we wanted and he was alright with us keeping it between us while we figure out where things are going. (This was my suggestion, but he agreed)

Things have been going super well up to this point. It's been casual, we've remained good friends, we're both very professional at work, and we're super sexually compatible. There is little romantic aspect to it, mostly just friends with benefits. It's been awesome. Flash forward to today, I was chatting with a co-worker (I'll call her Miranda) and she mentioned that she had run into him and his ""girlfriend"" the other day with his kids. Immediately I felt like I had made a huge mistake but I didn't want to jump to any conclusions because we have talked about how we both are single, want to stay that way, and are fine with each other seeing other people. There is also no sign of another woman in his apartment at all. I decided not to mention it to him right then.

After work, another coworker (I'll call her Alissa) and I were talking and he came up in conversation organically. Since Alissa is a friend of his, I decided to ask her if he was seeing anyone. She told me that him and the woman that Miranda had mentioned have been suspected of dating for about 6 months now but neither of them had said anything.

Now I'm in a situation where I am quite possibly the mistress. These two go out in public together, PDA, have met each other's kids, and are known by coworkers. A lot of that points to a committed relationship. However, this is all hear say. I have no way of verifying whether this is all true or not.

I have no idea what to do. We have plans tonight and I don't have a reasonable excuse out of it. I don't want to jump to conclusions based off of two coworkers assumptions but at the same time, I don't want to turn a blind eye and help this guy cheat.

What would you do in this situation? Should I bring it up? Should I just cut ties? We still have to work together so I have to address this situation carefully. Thanks for reading, any help is appreciated."

 I was 13 and sending nudes and doing sexual Skype calls with a 50 year old man becausel. They were nice to me. And when I didn't do what they wanted they got angry at me and insulted me and I felt terrible. It started at 13, a random man messaged me demanding to see my body naked and I just did it. I didn't think. I just did it for some reason.

I did that with so many men of all ages. I was 13 with cuts on my legs, naked in front of a black screen not knowing who was on the other side but just doing what they were telling me. The men wanted me to role-play their daughter which is just so disgusting. They wanted me to dress up like a child. They wanted me to slap myself and stick objects inside me and write ""dad's whore"" on my body  One (or more, I honestly can't remember because it was a mess) threatened to blackmail me and that terrified me. I was so confused and didn't know what I was doing, I was just doing whatever they told me. 

I don't want to offend anyone who's had physical childhood trauma but I really am starting to wonder if this has fucked me up for good. I have a horrible relationship with my body and sex and believe I'm just useless. I still can't say no or speak up. I feel disgusting and I long to feel innocent.

However, I’ve noticed a trend that whenever someone from the in-laws family moves into a new home, they are gifted a framed stock print of a religious figure with children and/or animals. Inevitably, we will be gifted a similar religious item. Normally, I would accept it gracefully then “lose” it in a move. At this point in my life, I don’t want to pretend anymore. We’ve been married for over 16 years and we are who we are.  MIL has sent me several texts letting me know she has something special that we need in our home. I already know it’s going to be a framed print of this religious figure. I don’t want it in my home and I’m at the point where I don’t even want to pretend to accept it.  I find their religion absurd and frankly, offensive. Here is my question: How do I decline a religious gift without causing a permanent rift with the in-laws?

It all started when I was young I was bullied at school and didn’t have many friends I felt so isolated and that I didn’t belong so I decide to  go to college and a different country and try to find something new. I was a virgin when I left because I didn’t believe in premarital sex and I am a Christian . The first two years with my grades were good I felt like achieving something and moving on . granted I didn’t have many friends still but I had some although I didn’t “overcome the cultural barrier.I met this girl at class and we sort of became friends I liked Her she was smart and beautiful and nice. I have mistaken her kindness with attraction. 
When I realize what I have done that have stupid it was of me to assume  that someone would actually want me and love me.  I fell into a spiral of depression and my grades fell down ,I didn’t go to the college as much and ignored the whole thing .at this time I have started working at night it is shitty job with the shitty manager did it that made things worse. all I did was wake up late jerk off and go to work I couldn’t concentrate on anything and I still can’t.

29229,8icnpl,corbz91,Losing my best friend of 10+ years,"I’ve been living with my best friend, KP, for almost 2 years. We had made plans to move to another state with another roommate, NA, at the end of our current lease because we figured we’re young and might as well experience other cities before we all settle down.

About a month ago I held a house meeting and let my roommates know that I received a promotion at work and wanted to take it, therefore I’d be staying in our current city. I brought up the fact that I need to focus on my career and self-growth. NA was happy for me and told me she wanted to stay in the city and get a place with her boyfriend anyway. We asked KP what he might want to do and he said he’ll probably just find somewhere else to live. That was the end of it.

Ever since then he hasn’t talked to me. Every time I come home from work he gets up from the couch and goes straight to his room and closes his door. Sometimes all three of us will hang out at home but NA is basically the middle man and KP doesn’t direct any conversation toward me.

I know he’s upset that I suddenly changed the plans and decided to stay in the city because his ex (who cheated on him) told me. He’s a bi-polar psycho. He’s messaged me on numerous occasions calling me a f*g in one message, and then telling me how attractive he thinks I am in the next message. I’ve told KP about the nasty messages and let him know this guy that he’s STILL messing around with is emotionally unstable and is not a good person to be with. He ignored me and hasn’t had a conversation with me since.

We’ve been best friends for 10+ years so it’s hard for me to watch this friendship fade. But at the same time I don’t feel like I did anything wrong and should be the one to make any moves. I also don’t regret speaking my mind about KP’s ex; he really isn’t a good guy. Maybe some friendships aren’t meant to last? Any advice?"

I feel like flirting is so foreign to me, but according to some of my friends I do it quite a lot with women. I feel like everyone has a different threshold for what qualifies as flirting. I only know that someone is doing it to(with?) me if they're super obvious about it because I'm oblivious to subtle social cues.

There's this Asian girl at work that I'm pretty sure flirts with me(lots of close proximity standing, touching, etc.). It doesn't matter that she's Asian but it kinda does. She's an immigrant and I'm kinda weary of reciprocating partly because of that, I don't want people to think I'm taking advantage of her, partly because it's a school job and I don't want to lose my only source of income, and partly because... I'm not Asian or white and I'm pretty conscious of it for this situation. It doesn't make me uncomfortable and it's not unwanted, I just don't know how or if I should do it back."

I cannot make money because I am too mentally ill to work, and cannot get help for my mental issues. I cannot do art commissions because 1) I am now too mentally ill to draw and 2) I cannot set up PayPal without my ID. I cannot get my ID because my parents are taking their sweet time to gather up the documents and take me to place to get it, and in my state I need my parent with me to prove I live where I do. I have been asking for help with my ID for almost 2 years. 

Moving out into a small clean place would help greatly with my mental health. My anxiety would probably give me a heart attack, but the people I live with are killing me. Not being able to do anything and being stuck in life is driving me insane and I really have no reason to live other than to keep suffering so my friends do not have to deal with my death. I really do not want to keep suffering, but I have no idea what to do. I need medication, but cannot get any without my parents help. But my parents do not care about me. They literally give no shits about me or any of my medical problems. It took me years of begging to get an important medication for an excruciating physical issue. Anything I ask for is a burden to them, and I cannot do anything on my own.

Also, I am really, really tired all the time. I do not go outside due to agoraphobia, so I know lack of sunlight could be bad. I cannot exercise unless it is push ups against the wall because I have no room inside to do anything (everyone in this household seem to be hoarders). We have an old exercise machine, but it is in the basement and I cannot go down there without my paranoia spiking. So if there is anything a 5'8"" person can do in 2'x3' space, let me know. And if there are any basic vitamins I can research to be more healthy since I do not move and do not go outside, again let me know.

I feel really stupid for posting this, but I am desperate and my friend says, ""a lot of people use reddit so you never know!"" so here I am. My head is really frazzled so I apologize if this does not make any sense. I really do not mind explaining anything in further detail if needed.

I barely talk to the people who I used to spend my life with. I mean, once every couple of weeks and nothing very deep. I've never been someone with a big circle of fiends, maybe 3-4 close friends at a time. I also tend to grow distant from my friends when in a relationship, and I got married about 2 years ago.

 I thought I was feeling shame/guilt/loss for my current situation, but now I think maybe it's just society's pressure to have friends that has me feeling that way? I am 27, happily married, a home owner, and comfortable with money. Currently taking time to save/travel before my husband and I truly settle down and have kids. I fear that I can't relate to people my age. They're all looking for love or working on their careers or trying to find themselves or being a carpool parent or hustling to afford rent. Aside from this friend problem, I really have no problems, nothing to vent or relate about. The idea of getting drunk and staying out late like I did just a few years ago is very unappealing now, but so is getting coffee in the morning or doing yoga or getting brunch. Socializing feels like a task, I have one good friend who I enjoy talking to but everyone else I keep up with is just out of the fear of being isolated.

Are social networks making me feel shame for something I truly don't care about right now? I have to admit, seeing past friends post pictures with tons of other friends gives me a little pang of shame. My husband also has a LOT of friends, which makes me feel like a reject for having only 1 or 2. In the future when we do have children, I hope to know the neighbors wherever we move and the other moms at school and form friendships with people who have things in common with me, people to 'do life with'. Right now, I feel like there is no one that is on the same page as me enough to truly do life with me, besides my husband. Is it okay for me to let go of these negative feelings about my lack of friends until I'm at a more relatable place in life?

TLDR: Suddenly realized I've drifted very far away from all of my friends and we are now different people. I want friends who can relate to me in the future, but socializing currently feels like an unnecessary burden. Is it okay to stop holding onto these friendships/trying to make new friends? Why do I feel shame about having no friends when I don't really want any at the moment? Is it the influence of social media and comparing myself to others? Should I suck it up and keep looking for friends that can relate to me now so that I don't become isolated?"

I've also been told that my face is hard to read so I just took it as a compliment that I'm mysterious in that way. I honestly never saw it that way since I am an introvert and quite socially awkward so in times like those, I just don't know what to do but either keep a straight face or smile.  But then I began to reflect on my past interactions with people then I realized how aloof I must be to other people. It doesn't help either that I don't have favorites/crushes so I have a hard time responding to  questions/statements like What kind of music do you like? or ""Person X is so dateable."" but I can understand all references from movies, vines, memes, pop culture etc that other people wouldn't probably understand. So in a way, I do have a personality when it comes to things like those but when we begin to talk about crushes or favorites or anything related to emotions, I don't have a lot to say. It has impacted my social life though since people tend to steer away from me when they do some banter or talk about their love life since I think that they think that I don't have a lot to say.

A few crushes here and there in 8th grade and early on in high school. But, at the time, that’s all I thought they were: crushes. So, I got over it and I thought she did too. We became BEST friends, told each other everything until about last year. She told me she couldn’t talk to me anymore. At the time, this was the first time that she tried doing this. 

Now, keep in mind that she’s had a boyfriend of about two years now that she loves very much. I have never tried to get in between them and I have always been supportive of them, even if I don’t personally like the guy. 

So, when she sprung this on me I was a little confused. But, I quickly found out through my own intuition that it was because she still liked me; A LOT. Apparently I was her first love. Apparently she still had significant feelings for me that she felt were getting in the way of her relationship, so she decided to cut me off. 

So, fast forward to now. She has tried that tactic a few times and it’s never worked. We’ve always gone back to each other because there’s just something there that can’t be explained. There’s chemistry. 

After our talk recently, I have had old feelings brought back to the surface and now I find myself attracted toward her once again. All I wish is that the situation were different. I wish she didn’t have a boyfriend. I wish we weren’t going to college in a few months. And, most of all, I wish that I hadn’t fucked up and let her go so many years ago. I’m sorry and I know she’d take me back in a heart beat if she didn’t have a boyfriend that she loved so much. I don’t want her to leave him for me, I simply wish the situation was different and I was the one she was with. I don’t know what to do. "

I've known I'm gay for a while but I've finally built up the nerve to go on a date with another woman. It's nothing fancy, just to a local bar for some drinks with a girl I met on tinder. I have no idea how to prep and extremely nervous. Tinder dates happen all the time out of the closet it just feels like the point of no return? Like I'm suddenly, officially, gay evn though I've known I'm not into men since high school. It feels like a big step even though it's just drinks. 

I had a boyfriend when I was still in the closet but we were never really the ""date"" type so this is probably, like, my third date ever. (Kind of behind, I know but I guess we all have to start somewhere). How do I calm my nerves? Is there any advice you'd vice in general? 
Thanks so much in advance."

Since then she's seemed less into me and angry at me. She's told me my response was the main problem and that we shouldn't talk for awhile.

4 year old when asked how bath with grandparent went said, things like...
""SECRET, really scary, really bad"" out of nowhere.  seemed extremely dissociated when talking about it. I attempted to find out what exactly child was talking about. Multiple times. At first it was just ""really bad. Can't tell you. Really scary. Secret"" Seems VERY SERIOUS.  Child feels unable to tell me what happened. 
facts
It is possible. Grandparent seems mentally unstable as hell. 
Can't get facts out of child.
Grandparent is ALWAYS extremely defensive about EVERYTHING. ANY confrontation would go nowhere except an explosion from grandparent.
History of sexual abuse and mental illness.
We live with grandparent. Grandparent pays for much of our lives. Car, housing etc. Parents do not have good job, honestly and successfully making steps to high paying job. Would essentially be homeless if serious issue ensued.

Summary- Child seems VERY disturbed. I tried everything to relate to and express to child the seriousness without putting words in their mouth. Tried casual talk. Tried everything.
In my heart I am almost sure. Loosing my fucking mind over this.
Even if I said ""so and so is too old for bath time"", there would be much drama and no guarantee. VERY dominant grandparent. 

Told child if it happens again tell me about it, if anyone is hurting you or making you uncomfortabe or doing things to you that makes you uncomfortabe to tell them to stop. Tell them you will tell your parents. Told child to decline bath time.

Feel like I'm going to implode.

I’m new to college this year and in my English class we have to write this huge research paper of any topic for our finals. I brought up the idea of researching whether LSD and psychedelics should be legalized to my teacher, and he seemed very enthusiastic about the idea.

As I’m sitting here brainstorming, an idea came to mind that I should try LSD for the first time myself (my cousin does it and sells it so obtaining a legit tab would be no issue of safety) and I was gonna include my experience into the paper, and whether I think it was pleasant or not.
The only thing I would be worried about is if he finds it inappropriate and reports it to the dean or something. I’m new to college so idk if professors care as much as Highschool teachers, or if he wouldn’t mind at all.

My partner and I have been together for I think about 10 years now. At first, it was great. I would spend time at her place, just me without my partner there and we'd have tea and catch up and it was wonderful. Now, I cant imagine doing that if my life depended on it. 

My partner is the oldest in his family and she is single. Hasn't had a long term relationship for a long time. She really depends on him. For everything. She has struggled with mental health issues in the past, but the woman cant make a decision on her own. Everything she does it feels like she needs to run by her son. 

We had our first baby 15 months ago and since we announced we were at the hospital in labour, things changed. She texted us constantly. Then when she was born, she wanted to be here to see the little one constantly. I try to remind myself that everything she does come from a place of love, but I just cant stand to be around her. If we dont text her back, she worries something has happened to us or our little girl. 

I love my partner and our little girl and our little family time so much and I hate spending precious family time on weekends with her. My partner would never admit it but it makes him super anxious and hes a different person around her. 

She comments on everything we do and definitely doesn't remember what it's like having a baby. 

I feel like I hold so much anger towards her and dread seeing her. I know it's not healthy and I wish i enjoyed her company but i just dont.

Little bit of backstory here I \[17M\] have been bestfriends with a kid I went to kindergarten with. We grew up together, spent a lot of time together, and always stood by each other. My friend is the stereotypical popular guy, has a gf, generally good looking etc... We went to the same school and always stood by each other no matter what the circumstances. All throughout 1-5 grade we would win the two peas in a pod award, very cringe but I want to emphasize how close we where.

Here is the whole story two weeks ago we where at a house party on the occasion that we graduated high school. Throughout the whole night we were drinking, smoking, you know celebrating, except for my friend in question, who we will call John, and another girl, lets call her Beth, who both don't smoke or drink. Throughout the whole night John was degrading Beth basically calling her a cow making fun of her appearance, he usually does this and we always shut him down telling him to stop and its not funny. Little later in the night and John and Beth completely disappear. 15 minutes later Beth appears and she looks like shes seen a ghost she comes over grabs one of the other girls, who we will call Ashley, and disappear into the house. John comes back sits back in the circle and doesn't say a word. Suddenly Ashley comes storming out and goes up to John and starts beating the shit out of him, I have literally never seen a women hit this hard or be this enraged, it scared the shit out of me. A couple moments later I pulled Ashley of John. Ashley turns around goes back inside and I see Beth in the distance crying. John was completely baffled at this point not knowing what just happened. I think I forgot to mention that Ashley and I are close friends. I go back with Ashley in the house to calm her down and try to understand whats happening at this point because I was more confused then ever. Ashley broke down and explained to me that John forcibly groped and tried to kiss Beth continuing to explain that he has been blackmailing Ashley with her nudes and forcing her to kiss him, send him more nudes. I was overcome with rage as recently my cousin was sexually assaulted and I was very open with John about how much it enraged me and how weak I felt that I couldn't do anything about it. I was completely baffled that John was capable of assaulting a girl and not to mention that he has always prided himself about how easy it is for him to hook up with girls. I had drank a bit and wanted to go beat the shit out of him but a group of people held me back before I was able to confront him. I left that party not only feeling weak, sad, and angry but confused. Its been two weeks since this incident and I haven't contacted or talked to him since. During these two weeks I have been in contact with two other girls who told me similar stories one of them where he got the girl drunk and forcibly groped her and kissed her, while the other girls story being that he has been forcing her to send him nudes for a while.

I have never been this confused and angry in my life not to mention what the girls had been through and having to keep it hidden. I have cut him out of my life completely and haven't spoken to him since. This type of behavior is something that I can't allow myself to be apart of, my brain would slowly kill me. But I just feel like I have to confront I feel the same way when I was told about what happened to my cousin, I hate this feeling I don't only feel weak, I feel lost, I feel powerless I can't even imagine what the girls are going through. Please tell me what to do should I confront him? should I just never talk to him again?

Lat thing I would like to add is that I come from a 3rd world country who still don't consider sexual assault as a criminal offence, I know fucking crazy that we still run a country this way, so involving the law would only be embarrassing for the girls."
38866,7liwx5,i_am_not_a_bat,Should I ignore/move away from my younger sister? And how do I do it?,"Hey guys! I'd love some advice.

I got diagnosed with depression this summer and I've been on anti depressants for about 6 months. My younger sister (17) really doesn't care, whenever I try to bring it up she mumbles and just looks at her phone.

I was having an awful day today (thought seriously about taking my own life on the rail tracks) and she just ignored me - when I asked whether she was going to ask how I was - which she then did - I said 'I'm depressed' and she said NOTHING. I asked her why she doesn't say anything and she said she didn't know what to say. I said that it's always better to say something than nothing, then moved into another room to cry (she HEARD me crying and did nothing about it). She has never said sorry to me or asked how I am. 

She cares only about herself, her snapchat story, her car from which she blares RnB music. She is generally an angry person - always sounding defensive and combative when I talk to her. She is lazy and selfish too.

She and I have never got along. I already tried to write her a letter explaining how I feel, but she didn't understand it/it wasn't met with the right response.

I'm home from college for the holidays - which is ok because I'm going back, but I've still got another three weeks to endure of this. What should I do? I will have to live with her after I graduate too as I'll probably move back into the family home.

She is the worst with me out of the whole family (parents and three kids). I honestly think she doesn't care about me.

Thanks for reading. My question is - do you think I should move away from her (emotionally) and HOW can I do this? Should I just ignore her round the house? Not look at her? She is making absolutely zero advances to improve our relationship. My depression is much much worse because of her.

THANK YOU!

TLDR; depressed 20 something has selfish and angry 17 y/o sister who bullies/ignores/doesn't care about her, and this is prompting suicidal thoughts. how can I cope with this and should I ignore her?"

But today, a person I know \(I classify him as a former friend, I don't like him anymore\) told me that the leader of the Group, a rich kid, didn't approve of me hopping off the deal.

I think I’m also bothered because she always seems to bail last minute rather than just up front decline. Additionally, it always feels like I’m the only one to make plans. I know her and I know that it’s not like she’s not avoiding me or there’s some unresolved issue I’m unaware of. I’ve been feeling very unmotivated to talk to her lately because of this. Thoughts? Am I being inconsiderate to her busy schedule or are my feelings justified? Both?"

1183,dn7ffn,Redgreenbrowngreen2,Going out of state for a party? Doesn’t feel right.,"Hey,

So long story short, I was enrolled at a university for a month and a half before I decided to withdraw due to financial reasons as well as not feeling at home at the school. 

The one aspect I actually liked about the school was the radio club. I met the members and got along really well. Though I only hung out with them twice before leaving.

I eventually left the state and went back to my home state 1,500 miles away, thinking I’d probably never get invited to hang out with them again, or invited to work on field projects outside of the school.

However, a few weeks ago, I got an invite to a Halloween party they’re hosting. I asked if it was ok to come considering I’m no longer in the school and they enthusiastically said yes. Here’s the trying though, they don’t know I’m 1,500 miles away as I had told them I’m gonna stay in the area (which I thought I would at the time).

Right now, I have three or so months until my next semester of college starts at another school, and since I had a falling out with my friends where I live now, I kind of wanted to fly in for the party. However, I feel so mixed about this. It just feels really sad and pathetic on a certain level, like, flying out 1,500 miles just to go to a Halloween party with people who are mainly acquaintances. I’ve kind of rationalized this by telling myself I’m going to continue to reside out there in the hopes that this party might blossom friendships/social life and/or let me get radio experience with them on their projects. Rent won’t be cheap, and I’ll have to get a job (either way really). It just feels weird going to a party and coming home from out of state. I really don’t want to admit to them that I went through these lengths to go to the party. Plus it’s a costume party, and just the thought of shopping for a costume in this context makes me cringe.

So, in all honesty, does going out there for this seem cringe/sad? Or am I crazy? I’m not sure if I should bail or not.

Again honesty is appreciated.

Thanks!"

Last night I babysat until 2am, which was no problem.

The mum came back sober, and the dad was plastered drunk.

I got paid, walked home.

At about 2:45am, the dad (who hardly talks to me whenever I'm over to babysit, despite me being relatively chatty), texts me saying I'm 'pretty', as well as some other choice words. He mentions that next time his wife is out that I should go over and him and I can play with their son and get to know each other. His words were 'I'd like to get to know the girl who is looking after my son more'.

He was obviously pissed when texting me, and I'm meant to babysit next Friday. Should I tell his wife? Would he bring it up? Should I find a new side job?"

34888,7yb46c,elephunny456,"Teacher is overestimating me, and everyone expect him knows i'm actually trash","TLDR: my band teacher thinks i'm good when i'm really not, moves me into the first seat, above my friend who is insanely good, practices multiple times everyday, and wants to pursue music in the future. should I make my teacher switch our seats?

I'm in high school, and I'm part of the school band. I've always played the first part, but sat in the second place in my section, and I'm totally fine with that (even though I'm pretty sure there are people in lower places who are so much better than me). The first player in my section is a good friend, Bob, who I believe is an amazing musician, deserves to be the first, and is in all ways better than me. 

However the music teachers always get it wrong. They completely underestimate Bob, and overestimate me. Since our teacher last year retired, he filled in the new music teacher with all the deets regarding me being GREAT at my instrument. So the teacher starts the year with the perception that I'm some sort of musical genius. Keep in mind that the only times the new teacher has heard me play so far was in band, as my school is divided in two semesters and I had music in the second semester. He hasn't really heard me play alone yet. 

One day the music teacher mentions us getting a new seating arrangement. Then one of my other friends (John)  in the section tells me that the teacher was going to keep Bob and John playing the first parts. At this point i'm like oh no, i'm being moved to the second part. 

So I go and tell Bob that oh no, i'm going to play the second part. He says don't worry, I still believe in you, you're still super good. And I'm upset, but I go on.

The next band rehersal was the first time we would all see the new seating arrangements. I walk in, expecting to be moved to the second part, however, once I get there, they all tell me i've been put in the first seat!!!?!?

I look over to bob, who says ""maybe the teacher changed his mind"" but I feel so bad for him. he practices so much more than I do, he wants to go into music post secondary, is INSANELY GOOD,  and I don't deserve to be first at all. 

I talked to the teacher about switching me and Bob's spots, but the teacher doesn't agree, goes on about how I play stronger and the kind of sound he wants for the band. He said if I really wanted to switch, then I could, but he says that's where I belong. 

I also have playing tests coming up, and I know I don't sound good at all. I don't want him to hear my playing and realize oh shit, she really is bad. Part of me wants to stay as first clarinet, and i don't want the teacher to think I don't respect him. 

Just to let you know, I""m not even being modest. I'm actually trash, and I have no clue what in the world the music teachers see in me. 

Should I go back to my teacher and tell him that I want to switch for sure, or just stay as first and possibly hurt my friend? "

14039,btmhqn,Wendigo-3,How should I cut off my friend?,"I have been friends with this boy for about 2 years or so and its been pretty chill but now its getting too much.  He previously had a crush on me and apparently still does, even though he knows i'm a lesbian. He cracks crude jokes and constantly talks about having sex with me.

At an event, he completely separated from me and left early by like 5 hours for no reason while i spent about 2 hours waiting for him. I had to ask him where he was and the time he spent with me was boring and uncomfortable, he kept touching my neck around other people and trying to act like a couple.

Last week we agreed to smoke weed after the event (my first time, he smokes regularly) it was chill until we sat down and he said that I was fake and kept trying to prompt an argument or my secrets. I asked him to stop being intrusive but he didn't so I just stopped talking to him then. I forcefully had to ground myself while high because I started to feel unsafe around him. We had planned to go to his room but I was still feeling pretty paranoid so I just went straight to my hotel room and locked myself in. He proceeded to call me a cunt the next morning.

Am I right for wanting to leave this friendship and how do I approach it? He's suicidal and almost killed himself after his ex broke up with him but its too draining for me to be around him."
39206,7kf22q,newtond1221,Please convince me not to leave my wife,"I've posted on here a couple of times asking for help with a struggling marriage and I got some good advice, but I think I am at my wits end.

It's hard to describe this situation without a novel, but to make this as short as I can, my wife and I are both mentally ill. We had an extremely happy and healthy marriage all the way up to around August of this year or so. My wife has bipolar II disorder, chronic depression, and PTSD (childhood abuse). As for me, I'm autistic. This has caused a few struggles, especially early on in the marriage but we quickly got used to each other and learned how to cope healthily.

As for where it went wrong, Well, it's hard to say. Around August my wife started to heavily get into role play (she still is) but sometimes she took these rps too far. She admitted this to me and of course I was upset. She started behaving recklessly in person as well (drinking, smoking, etc.). To make matters a million times worse, during this time she was raped by our close friend. This in itself is the main reason I'm trying to stay strong and by her side. I don't know how she feels so I try to understand her actions more.

My wife has brought up divorce more times than I can even count. She has talked about being unhappy with me, saying she pities me and that's why she is even with me, but on the other hand has said things like she wants to work things out with us and she wants to go back to how we were. I know that may never happen, but I would give anything for it to. My wife is the type of person that needs constant attention and validation; this has also put a strain on things. She is overly flirtatious with guys and has even gone pretty far with what she will say and do with some of them. She has sent nude photos to guys twice (that I know of) and done countless sexual rps.

I do everything for this woman, I take care of her, I buy her things, I give her all of my love, she never has to worry about me ever. Meanwhile with her I'm constantly worrying about who she is talking to and what they're doing. I've snooped a few times but ive decided not to ever again as to avoid being hurt again from what I read.

My main point in this isn't to make you hate my wife. I love my wife. I would die for my wife. I would do just about anything for her. There's a reason I married her in the first place. The thing is though, I'm so constantly worried, and I fear she will always be this way. I don't know if the rape has made her feel like this, but my theory is that she mildly felt this and what happened dialed it up to 1000. 

I understand if my wife is changed forever. I can deal with that. What is getting increasingly difficult to deal with, however, is the uncertainty of things. The worry and fears. I don't think she'd leave me for another guy but it is NOT ok for her to be so overly flirty with everyone. She has sort of always been this way, but her love for me always balanced it out. I.e. guys would be super flirty with her and she would flirt back but also at the same time mention how much she loves her husband. She used to constantly post about me on Facebook, and I mean as often as at least once a day. Now, she'll tag me in the occasional thing but nothing ever love or relationship related. 

The way I put it best is the person being so flirty and hurtful towards me isn't actually my wife. She is someone else. And sometimes I see my wife come out and I see love in the way she looks at me and holding her feels like heaven etc. But 80% of the time she is distant and getting attention from guys that aren't me.

Also, I know people will suggest therapy, but I've tried convincing her and I don't think she wants to. I'm willing, but she isn't. She mentioned being up for it one time but hasn't mentioned it since then."

We always butted heads cause I tend to speak up or push back because things go chaotic and unprofessional. The other leadership member sat there and watched me pick up these papers. It hurt me so bad, I’ve been interviewing and my only thing that holds me back is “experience” and I was told that I needed to be hands on and have more experience for the responsibilities when majority of the time, I was.

36953,7rc20p,lingerer1010,How do I deal with my boyfriend's douche-bag roommate?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now and we've been living together for probably 3 months. The roommate, I'll call him Joseph, has always seemed standoffish, but not anything out of the ordinary. We've hardly spoken and the few times we have its been about mundane things. Needless to say we're not close and I've always had the feeling he didn't like me.

 About two months ago Joseph's girlfriend moved in, Rachel, and she brings her huge, loud, and obnoxious dog with her (Joseph also has a medium sized dog). I've been pushed to staying in my boyfriend's room 24/7, only coming out to use the bathroom, get food, and go to work, because they've literally taken over the house. They stay up all hours of the night, talking loudly, throwing dog toys around, playing video games. I usually work mornings, so I can never get any sleep. I've told my boyfriend about this and he reassured me he'd handle it and they aren't doing anything with ill intent. 

Nothing has changed, only gotten worse. They don't pick up their dog's poop outside, so both me and my boyfriend have ruined numerous pairs of shoes. They've added a squeaky toy to the array of sounds keeping me up at night, and to add fuel to the fire Joseph leaves a passive aggressive note on a stack of dishes saying ""Clean this shit up"". 

My boyfriend sends him a text message asking him if he left the note for him and he says he has and he's tired of cleaning up after me and my boyfriend (We never leave the bedroom. They never clean up after their dogs - there's dog fur is literally everywhere). Joseph tells him that he's tired of spending over $150 a month on toilet paper, paper towels, etc. (Keep in mind my boyfriend pays the Internet and gas bill monthly equaling over $120 without any hangups and no one has asked Joseph to pay for these things). He says he's not trying to be a dick, but he's equally if not more mad than my boyfriend about the situation.

 This all happened last night through text messages and they've yet to speak about it in person even though we're living in the same house. 

I'm not sure what to do. I know the roommate is in the wrong, the text messages that he sent my boyfriend are extremely rude and they've been friends for years. I feel like he has a problem with me staying here. I want to confront him, but I don't want to cause anymore problems before we have the opportunity to move out and get our own place. I just feel highly disrespected and it doesn't seem like my boyfriend is going to do anything about it.  
OH- I forgot to put that Joseph's alcoholic mother has a key (Joseph didn't ask my boyfriend about this) and she comes in anytime she wants and stays in the living room until she decides to leave, without telling anyone she's coming over.

28108,8ocvtz,InstitutionalizedOat,I feel like my sister is holding my whole family hostage.,"Sorry if this gets long.

So back in the beginning of February, my sister \(18\) ran away. She had failed a drug test at school for pot a month before and had been put on a sort of probation by the school and by my mom. They were going to test her again but my mom wanted to do one on her own to know if my sister was still smoking it and my sister failed that one. A huge fight broke out between them. The very next day, she packed a bag and left without saying anything to anyone. Just walked out the door and left. She left a note on my mom's bed leaving snarky comments about how she's always being compared to me and my brother \(I'm the oldest at age 23 and she is the youngest\) and that she doesn't want to be a part of our family. We finally figure out that she's staying at a friend's house and she stays there for the next month, coming back to our house for just a couple things like clothes and stuff but we only let her come in when someone else was in the house. When she came back, things were really tense and I was really pissed off at her and still am. My mom is a single mother who I feel like has given up a lot for me and my siblings and I feel like my sister doesn't realize that because she was too young to remember what it was like when my mom and my step dad \(my brother's and sister's biological father\) got a divorce.  


My sister has always been very emotional and will be fine for a little bit but will quickly turn into a straight up nightmare at the drop of a hat for no reason. My grandmother has been diagnosed with BPD and I've started to wonder if my sister has it, too. We don't really have a lot of money and my mom and sister both don't have any health insurance so it's hard to get my sister in to see a doctor and get her medication.  


The biggest problem is that since she came back, I feel like none of us are allowed to say anything to her about her unacceptable behavior. My mom especially just wants to try and forget that my sister even ran away and doesn't want me or my brother fighting with her. But she stays home all day now that school is out \(she's hopefully going to get enough financial aid to go to a university where she will live in the dorms but we haven't found out for sure yet\) and she has a boyfriend that she was secretly seeing before she ran away and they just spend all day at our house not doing anything. This boyfriend is 22 and was friends with my brother before my brother found out they were dating and now wants nothing to do with him. This boyfriend also has a kid that he doesn't really see. The whole time him and my sister have been hanging out at our house, he's only had the kid with him once. He supposedly also has a job and yet he is always at our house and eating our food that my mom pays for \(again, money is tight in our family\). My mom has tried to tell my sister that she needs to get a job but my sister is barely trying, just waiting for a babysitting job to fall in her lap or something. My sister also makes messes and never cleans them up \(for instance, she left a soda in the freezer too long and it exploded and she just left it in there for someone else to take care of\). And the worst thing is that sometimes she will sneak into my room and steal stuff. It usually isn't anything that important, like an air freshener or some clothes or something, but it still bothers me. A couple weeks ago, I noticed that I was missing my copy of Overwatch. My sister likes playing the game and has asked a couple times if she can play it since she's gotten back, to which I have always said no because I am still angry with her. So when I noticed that it was missing, I asked her if she took it. She said no. She doesn't have a PS4 of her own, but I still thought maybe she took it just to spite me. Today, I come home and she has a PS4 in her room that her boyfriend supposedly gave her as a graduation present. And what's inside there? My copy of Overwatch. And I know it's my copy, despite her trying to say that her boyfriend bought it for her. This bothers me a lot more than the last times she's taken stuff because it's the first time she took something and then lied to me about it when I asked her. And she still is trying to say it isn't mine, so she has every intention of keeping it. But of course, I can't press the issue because it stresses my mom out and my sister will have a meltdown. Am I taking this too hard? I know it's just a game, but it bothers me to think of what else she might steal and it upsets me that she would even steal from me in the first place. I've put a lock on my door that needs a key but sometimes it gets unlocked from my brother and he doesn't always lock it back.  


I want to say something to my sister, but I don't want to upset my mom who tries to make excuses for her by saying she's young and hormonal.  


tl;dr: I feel like my sister is selfish, ungrateful, lazy, and a thief with a loser boyfriend but I can't say anything because it stresses my mom out. How can I survive until she hopefully leaves for school and what do I do if she ends up having to go to community college and stays at home?"
25900,90d4za,whinybiitch,Looking for online work and not having any luck,"I have a full time job that I'm extremely grateful for but - to cut the long story short - due to medical issues requiring me to stay at home it's looking more like part-time work. I haven't been consistently making enough for rent and basic needs due to not working enough hours. I would like to spend my rest days doing something productive as most of the time I am not incapacitated and well enough, I believe, to work. The thing is, I don't think I have much marketable skills. I do not hold a degree (I'm working on changing this). I know that doing free online courses maybe beneficial but I want to do something income-generating at the moment.

**What I've tried so far:**

- Looked for waitress/service crew/retail work 

I'm very willing to do retail but I've yet to find a place that accepts my inconsistent schedule. I don't think my work will appreciate me doing a retail job when I'm supposed to be on ""sick leave"" either.

- Went through every link I can find in r/BeerMoney, r/BeerMoneyGlobal and r/WorkOnline that is available in my country (Philippines)

They're mostly survey and click- or download-for-pay sites that does not have nearly enough offers, or for some reasons suddenly dwindle on offers when I almost reach the minimum payout amount. I have tried signing up for content writing websites as well but I haven't been accepted due to English not being my first language.

- Looked for work on local freelancing sites

I've tried bidding for work several times but haven't received any offer yet. It's quite disheartening as I've tried to build up my profile with as many skills and experience that I can but I don't know how I'll compete with and stand out from others. I have no idea how I'm suppose to start and honestly I haven't really found any work that I'm confident I can do well.

- Applied for local online tutoring jobs

This I do believe I'm qualified for but they require a stable internet connection. I have only very spotty prepaid broadband internet for my laptop.

**What I can do:**

- I'm fairly fluent in English and can speak two Filipino languages (Tagalog and Bicolano)

- I can force out cohesive articles every once in a while. I do feel like my English is obviously ""non-native"" and I'm not sure how to fix that.

- I have experience in retail and customer support so I do have some customer service skills.

- I average at 60 WPM.

- I am willing to work at very low rates. I earn around US$2 per hour at my current work and I can go even less than that if need be.

I'll greatly appreciate anyone who can point me in the right direction. Thank you!"

We have no bad feelings towards each other tho. It's more like we still love each other as individuals but live our own lives.

It's not always me who strike up the conversations, it's actually my ex who does that often and I'm confused because the conversations always end with him saying to me “don't be a stranger” or “we haven't talked in a while, it's good to hear from you from time to time.”

I know it's not a daily thing and some might think it's not a big deal, but I've never been in this kind of relationship with my other exes, so I'm confused. We keep in touch, we catch up, we ask each other how our family are doing and stuff.. 

I'm working abroad atm so we're not able to meet up or anything now, but I'm going back home this October and he told me he would love to have a cuppa with me or at least plan something to do together. 

I don't know what he wants, maybe he just doesn't wanna lose me as a person in his life or maybe he wants to get serious with me again, but because I'm going to move to another country this November, there is a slim chance that we get back together. I don't know what he wants, I always thought there was no point in contacting my exes unless there is an intention of getting back together. What should I do?.. it feels kinda weird, but not uncomfortable or anything. I'm just confused."

B never ever got along with my housemate, he was friendly with me most of the time since I waited for him to be comfortable with me whereas housemate would try and physically force himself on B. About 2 months later B went missing one night, he often explored at night but always came back just not this time. Housemate couldn't care less.

Around Christmas time, I had A come into my room and cuddle up to me, housemate came looking for him and found him, i let him out and then started hearing BANG BANG BANG like something hitting the floor over and over. I open the door to look and housemate has pinned A down on the ground and slamming his thong next to his ear over and over. I went off at him and A escaped, housemate brokenly explained he was only scaring him so he wouldn't go into my room again. I told him if I ever saw him doing that again I would call the RSPCA. 

Now tonight I came home from the gym and found A with rope attached to a small zip-tie around his neck with i estimate about 1.5cm of play in the tightness, I could still hear him struggling to breath. I ran and got my clippers and cut it off, housemate comes down at this point and i go off at him again. Nothing im saying is getting through the language barrier, his wife comes down and they start speaking in Chinese. They take the cat into their room and close the door.

What the fuck do I do? On one hand i need to protect this animal from an absolute spastic of an owner but on the other hand I live in one of the most expensive cities to live in (think San Francisco) and can't afford to move."

She was the type of person that believed pretty = successful, and it's safe to say I developed an eating disorder at a very young age.  
Well, now I have a 7 month old daughter of my own, and 2 step daughters as well (8 &amp; 12) and I don't want them growing up and watching me deal with hating my body and how I look. I want to feel comfortable in my skin, but at the same time, I no longer want to obsess with how I look. (not saying that I want to let myself go, but it is too high of a priority for my liking).

I'll think of something I want to do, reading a book, playing a game, watching something on TV. I go start doing the thing and instantly feel bored and don't want to do it anymore. 

This has led me to start doing something, say playing a game I really wanted to play, then I get bored and stop. I often power through it to try and overcome the feeling, but end up dropping it altogether and never finishing. I have games half complete that I just walked away from and never went back to.

Is it depression? It kills me that I want to do things, go to do it and don't want to do it anymore, leaving me forever bored or unsatisfied."

I'm trying to become self confident and stop being such an introvert, who is afraid to be himself around others. I'm working to stop being so uncomfortable.
Im trying to get better everyday, and I'm making good progress. 

Through highschool I had an awful time. I was awkward, and had terrible anxiety. So bad that I had to leave school and go to online school.
This stunted my social life so much, and I finally began to realise it. I missed out on relationships, friends, parties. I never got to experience any of those things. It got to the point where I stopped leaving the house completely. 

But I knew that had to stop. I hated what I became. So I saw a psychiatrist. And now after cognative behaviour therapy, and exposure therapy. I can leave the house with no fear, I can go out with friends, I can go to places I've never imagined (like movie theaters)
I am ready to start living my life.
I've been making friends, real friends. We went out to the movies and I had a great time. We stayed up all night talking, I loved it. But I still felt me being a little awkward. 

I want to change that. I want to be able to talk to my friends normally. I want to be able to initiate conversations. I want to be able to talk with confidence. I want to be able to take selfies, or post pictures on social media without feeling or looking awkward. I want to have a romantic relationship. 

I'm sorry if this is a vent/rant. I just need to get it all out. I need advice on becoming the social person I want to be. I want to feel comfortable being with people, and with talking to people.
I want to stop shutting myself in, I want to stop being alone and scared to meet new people. 

I've been browsing /r/socialskills. Its been helpful. But I'm trying to get as much advice as I can get.  

How does one become more social, confident and have relationships, and not feel like awkward or scared?"

Still always whenever i join a new group of people, whether it's a new class, tuitions or anything like that I always find myself being bullied. The bullying is mainly targeted at me being overweight(been so since childhood) but i don't think it's because of that, I just think there's something about me, that even if i wasn't overweight I'd be bullied 
Anyways I'm starting college pretty soon and I'm really excited and scared too, most of the new people I'll meet there, and with them ofc new bullies.
I don't really know what I'm asking for here? I'd just like to let be but i that's not how it'll be, so is there something I could do?"

I am not a bad son or student as most of you think. The issue is, My dad wants me to get straight As and maybe only 1 B. While i am actually getting some As and Bs and a C or worst case a D+.
Now my dad wants to go to my uni with me tomorrow to check up on me with my professors, and while I do good I sometimes skip class, like once every week to do other things or simply to cool of my stress with friends. While my dad hates me and doesnt want me to have friends to make my life even worse.
I also promised him good grades, which 2 courses are currently a struggle but its still half the semester and I will turn them to As or Bs but as of now Cs. 
If he finds out I am screwed, I need a way to get him to not come to my uni or to get my professors to be out of their office for a while.
Any help is needed.
My dad will drop me off at work then take me to uni so I wont have my car tomorrow.

I'm 30 years old. I've never considered myself gay. I've never had sex with a man. I don't find men attractive.

I met this girl at my job (uber). She's incredibly attractive and 100% convincing (meaning I didn't know she was transgender until the sex happened). She's awesome, and we're still talking. It could turn into something more...I like her. Okay, so if you're still reading I'm about to get a little graphic, if anything solely for the sake of being accurate. I want good advice...

Now...with that being said...I've been watching internet porn since the 90's. One thing that has, strangely enough, always been a mainstay in my searches has been transexual porn.

Long story short...I find the act of having sex with a transgender woman completely arousing. Sorry to be so crude here, but to put it plainly I don't want to suck a man's dick, but if it's a dick on an attractive and feminine transgender then I'll suck it all night. I don't however want it in my butt...Anal sex as a top with a transgender is awesome though.

I'm sorry to be so crude, but I want my situation to be clear...I don't know what I am! I know I'm not gay, but am I bi?

The other thing I'm worried about is...what if this gets serious? My close family, that matter most, love me and would accept that, but I have some extended family that refused to allow me to functions back when I was simply dating a black girl :(

oh and this girl I just hooked up with is black as well...you can see where this is going. like I said my family that matter won't care, but there are those that do, and it honestly makes me sad and angry and fuck I hate it."

He has a section of loose, fine curls on the top of his head near the front and amazingly springy,yet, tight, coarse curls on the back and sides. I buy shampoo specifically for mixed hair, I use a leave-in conditioner and I try not to wash his hair too much, although this is difficult since he is nearly four-years-old and loves to tumble outside. I use an afro- pick and a boar hair brush and am mostly able to get a sweet looking 'fro on him while he has a bath.

My concern is that I will, somehow, ruin his gorgeous hair if all I do is continue picking away at it. I know there are protective styles that would help his hair but he is not exactly a kid who sits still, even when a favorite   television show is on. I love his hair but am kind of at a loss of how to style and care for  it appropriately, especially as he gets older and may voice opinions about his hair. Does anyone have any resources they have found helpful or advice to give a somewhat follicley- inept parent?

We both get a certain amount of money given to us each month and agreed to split it in half but I haven’t seen my half of it (the money gets deposited to her bank account). At one point she even agreed I should use all of it for a few months so I can get settled since she has a decent job, a car, luxury items, and has lived here for a while.

I recently went on a long trip and was only sent a tiny amount and it wasn’t nearly enough to cover any expenses or close to being my half. Her excuse for not sending more was she had to pay her bills but my money shouldn’t be used for that especially when she pays for things that aren’t needed. She spends money like crazy and I need to save my portion of the money so I can get a car (where I live a car is necessary to get a job or go to the store) and small things that I have needed for a while. 

She expects me to ask permission to use any of the money instead of depositing it to me, but I am an adult and should be given my money so I can use it when I need it. Its very demeaning and embarrassing to ask for basic things like underwear or a toothbrush when I could easily buy it myself. 

I know half of the money should be given to me without asking for it but I’m not confrontational at all and don’t really know how to bring up these types of  subjects. I don’t want her to think I’m being mean or demanding especially since I’m bad at bringing up serious subjects.

I'm trying to be polite and didn't want to say anything like, no I was just using you for entertainment, so I say sure, not expecting them to ever actually come back, and go back to doing nothing.

Fast-forward one week to last weekend and they showed up again, and at this point I felt like I was in to deep to tell them to go away, so I just told them that i'm a full time student, which is true, and had a lot of homework to do that day, which was a lie, and they left. Fast-forward another week to today and they showed up again and once again I told them that I had a lot of homework to do, which was true this time, and instead of immediately leaving like they did last time they still insisted on sharing a scripture and gave me a pamphlet, which I immediately throw in the recycling when I got inside.

I know this is all my fault, and the simple answer is just telling them not to come back, but I can't figure out how to do that in a polite way, and without revealing the whole unused them for entertainment thing.

32846,84vrsv,Analyticsthrowaway11,Ex business partner screwed me over and took over an ecommerce retail business we built together. I still have access to the Google Analytics and Instagram account and I'm building a competing site at the moment.

Got screwed over bad and totally out of the dark. Due to us being best friends, we didn't sign a contract on the business and now after me doing most of the work for 4 years, he just suddenly denied my access everywhere and basically took over the company.

I have consulted a lawyer and unfortunately it looks like our verbal agreement + text message logs talking about our mutual business will not hold up in court, so legally speaking I'm screwed here.

However, it was me who did most of the work and who was the expert in the niche, so I'm building a competing site right away and I'm hoping to launch in a couple weeks.

I still have access to the old company's Instagram account (which he knows obviously, because he can't login) and the Google Analytics (this he doesn't know about). I haven't posted anything on Instagram after the ""breakup"" because I don't really know what the wisest thing to do is.

Time might be a factor here, because the ex business partner has access to the parent Facebook account and might get the Instagram account with the help of Insta support. Also, he might notice the Analytics access and revoke it, but this isn't as likely.

How do I maximize my advantage from these two accounts?"

He left work after he was told this and is supposed to have a meeting with both the manager and the owner on Monday when he returns. He wants to go into the meeting and ask for $20/hr to compromise but he’s afraid they’ll say no and he’ll be out of a job. He needs this job until he can find a new one. 

He currently lives at home and has already signed a lease for May 1 based on his income. 

Ive already posted in legal advice to see if there’s any legal action he can take. But if he can’t, does anyone have any advice on how he should handle this meeting? How would you handle the meeting? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

If I meet a girl and I like her and I think shes hot later on the initial sparks kinda wear off and I have a hard time accepting that shes not the hottest girl in the world and it makes me feel like im a bad person. Like I walk outside and I see girls that are just straight up cuter like I would never cheat but just the thought of thinking another girl is hotter makes me feel like i shouldn't even be dating her. Which is fine, except I will do this for literally any girl. Which means I'll never be able to date anyone on the planet at this rate.

I drive a nice car (5 years old now, it was bought as a brand new Lexus) and I want an even nicer one. My family is well off and I could easily buy it but when will it be enough. When will I be satisfied? I'm worried my standards are just infinitely high and my expectations are infinitely high and growing indefinitely. In this scenario its an issue with being satisfied too. I can't just kepe wasting money jumping from nice car to nicer car or jumping from cute girl to cuter girl. Its just not sustainable and in the girl scenario Im probably also going to end up hurting peoples feelings too."

21507,ardv69,competentafternoon,I feel completely overwhelmed.,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I'm 19F.

&amp;#x200B;

To make a long story short, I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness (JW) by a single mom who had me when she was 19 when she was out of the religion. she came back in when I was born. If you don't know much about JW, it's very controlling and has caused me a lot of mental health issues, from depression to anxiety.

Until a few years ago, I had no contact with my dad. He lived far away and had his own life, wife, and kids. He eventually reached out to my mom on facebook and my mom gave him short answers. Part of being a JW is limiting contact with anyone outside of the religion. My mom always kept me updated on things he sent.

Fast forward to a year and a half ago, when we moved from the place I was born and raised to a tiny town in the rural south. I left my entire network of friends behind, and I was depressed for a while as they didn't text me that often. I start questioning whether I want to be JW, and eventually I decide that I don't. I also decide that I want a relationship with my dad. Since my mom was the mediator between me and him using facebook, I let her know to tell him I might be interested in getting to know him. 

Well, my mom has decided she wants out too, which is awesome. I tell her she can send more things about me to him. Long story short, I eventually find out that my dad is having an affair with my mom while he's still married and has kids with another woman. It hurts me a lot, and I'm still angry. 

My mom has been defensive about it, saying that she doesn't need my permission and that he was sooooooo unhappy with his wife. And that's right, she doesn't need my permission or anything, but it makes me sick, and it influences my opinion of him and of her. My mom was married to another dude while we were JWs and he was terrible. They separated when I was 10 because he was abusive and an alcoholic, and it's just been me, my little brother, and my mom since then. I know what it's like to live in a single parent household, and it sucks (even worse as a JW). And I know that parents shouldn't stay together for their kid's sake, but the fact that they're not even divorced and he's dating my mom makes me so angry. I don't understand why they can't just wait until they're divorced. I'm not sure where he's at with that, as they were supposed to tell their kids that they were divorcing and he was supposed to get his own place, but idk if that happened.

Anyway, my mom and my dad have been trying to push me towards having contact with him. I've still never met him, but I do message him through Facebook. He seems like a pretty nice person, I guess. He thinks the world of me and it terrifies me. 

I wouldn't call my mom abusive, but she's convinced I had a wonderful childhood and she did an awesome job at raising me, which I would contest. Yes, I never went hungry and I had everything I needed. But my great work ethic and always keeping everything clean? stems from my anxiety of her yelling at me when I didn't finish a chore. I remember one time when I was 14-15 and I had to clean the house while she was at work, and I knew she was having a bad day, so I made her gluten free chocolate cupcakes. The majority of the housework was done, but I think there was still some little things that didn't get finished. She comes home and starts yelling at me because something wasn't done and I just start bawling because I tried to do something nice for her. When she sees the cakes she stops yelling and I think she might have apologized, but I still remember it. This was a constant event in our house. to this day I still can hear her voice in my head and think about how upset she would be when I think about not doing something related to the house chores. I'll come home from a long day of school in the morning and a closing shift at night and there'll be dishes in the sink and I'll apologize profusely for not putting them away even when she says it's okay, that I could just do them in the morning. The first words out of her mouth when I told her I was getting a full ride this semester at school was ""good, now you can start paying rent.""

Anyway, I'm getting off track. My relationship with my mom is strenuous. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I take my car into the dealer to get a recall fixed and also to get my coolant leak examined. Dealer tells me it's going to be around $2500 to get everything in my car that needs to be fixed, fixed. My dad's a mechanic and he calls and he manages to get the coolant repair down to $1300. I am upset over this, but thankfully I have the savings that will be able to cover it. However, it's still stressful as it does take a major part of my savings (I had around 3k saved.)

Mom and I go to dinner and she tells me that she thinks that I should write or talk to my dad to get the tensions out and I should say it if I feel it. She also says that I could do the same with her and that not worry about her getting upset, which is such a load of BS. 

And just now, she got home from work and I've been brewing over this in my head (there's a lot of other little things, this is just the main picture) and I'm upset. I don't want to talk about it with her. She tells me that if I don't tell her what's wrong, I need to stop acting upset. She assumes it's about my car and she tells me that ""You have a good life. Most kids your age would be screwed if that happened with their car. Be thankful you have the money saved"" and I just shake my head because telling someone they have a good life is such a loaded statement. I do have a good life. But I'm also stressed af- I have two different dudes who are into me and idk how to let them down without being mean and I have work (customer service at a grocery store) and school (first midterm due sunday) and I just feel like I'm going to collapse. I applied for the disney college program to try and get away and I was rejected and it fucking hurts because that's all I want.

Anyway she completely invalidated how I was feeling and I hate it. I wish I could move out but I don't have the money. Everything just fucking hurts and I wish I Had some irl friends to help me through it. what should I do about my dad?? how should I handle my mom?? please help.

14008,btovlk,throwehwei-123,Advice for improving my game with women?,"As a disclaimer I want to point out that I am in no way bitter towards women, other men who get women, or blaming anyone but myself for not improving in this regard. I am genuinely just curious to hear what advice some of you may have for me in improving. 

To give you guys some context, I am 20 year old male currently studying at a big state university. The party scene at my school is very ripe and many would say it is very easy to hook up with girls and have sex. I am a virgin, but I have had several hookups with girls throughout high school. I am asking for help on how to improve with women because I started to notice that more and more of my friends are seemingly getting into relationships and generally have an average sense of how to talk to women. Now, I am not completely socially inept in any way. I can hold a conversation with girls just fine, and many of my friends and acquaintances have told me that I have a good sense of humor and am funny. The thing I don’t understand is how to attract women. I just don’t understand how to act around a woman to basically compel them to spend time with me in an intimate environment, or attract them sexually for that matter. I feel as if there is almost an inherent element that makes women somewhat  attracted to men, whether it be their confidence, way of talking, and to a certain extent physical appearance. What are some of your experiences in improving in this regard and what can you suggest for me?"

Not in a weird sexual way but more in the way that I just want to be able to put my arm around her. This has been going on for a while now and she knows that I like her, bit off and on I've been worrying that sometime bad is going to happen to her like that she is going to dy in a car wreck and I what I would do if that happened. I would be absolutely devastated. This worry has been getting to me and kind of creeping me out. I talked toy school counselor about this feeling and she said that I should ask the girl if she was alright because there might be something going on in her life and that I had a gut feeling about it. I asked the girl and she said that she was fine and everything was alright, but I'm still kind of having that weird feeling.

I first started to worry about her about 2 months ago and the feeling has been going off and on.
Also I feel like I would give my life for her at any given moment I don't know why this is and I feel the same way of my mother, but this is different and I don't know how to put it in words

I'm just really confused and worried and kind of creeped out

I also thought that a I would be over this girl already as I've noticed my love for her for about 6 months now and that's another thing that I feel really weird about.

The problem is this cat is a fucking terrible little animal. It's been here for three days and it has shit somewhere in my apartment, not it's litter box, five times since my friend left. 

&amp;#x200B;

It knows where it's litter box is because it fucking pees in it.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day I came home to find giant cat turd behind some garbage bags in my kitchen and there were little shit pawprints on the wall near by. Furthermore the cat refuses to clean it's backside, so it walks around with cat feces all over it's backside and makes my entire apartment smell like fresh cat shit. What do I even do? I tried cleaning it with some wet paper towel but it just makes everything smell like fresh shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

To make matters worse it fucking meows *constantly* until I pick it up and pet it for a good 15 minutes, which I would be fine with *if it wasn't covered in cat shit.* 

&amp;#x200B;

What the fuck am I supposed to do? I'm quickly losing sympathy for this damn cat - should I just tell this person that I can't watch the cat any more?

714,dq8uj9,lyssaly,How to get out of being yelled at for talking at work,"Trying to make this concise, I’m a student worker in a college dining hall and work 7am-2pm three days a week. There are three managers, and the one who runs the service area is extremely strict, like no talking no smiling if you aren’t working you’re getting screamed at strict. I work at the least visited serving station and I stand there for hours with little to do. Typically around 1:30 we have a huge lull to the point where all the stations will be open with no student even in the serving area. Today was the same as usual, but I made the mistake of spending the last ~10 minutes of my 7hr shift talking to one of the full time staff (who is under the same manager) while standing at my perfectly cleaned and restocked station. This is only a problem because another full time person who is known for “telling on” people for doing things that waste time could see us. Most of the things she “tells on” other people for are things she also does :). 

I’m like 90% certain I’m going to be yelled at on Monday. Not sure what to say to get out of it. I have gotten out of being reprimanded in the past but I think I’m fucked this time.

2785,df4xr1,wtf_yall,Am I toxic for walking away from an argument?,"I originally tried to post this on AITA, but content regarding sexual assault isn't allowed there

Last night my boyfriend (M23) and I (F20) went to dinner, and as we were walking back to our separate apartments (same building), our conversation turned to an email we had both received from our college police earlier that week, notifying students that a sexual assault had been reported in the library bathroom, with a description of the suspect. 

I had received a followup email about the incident earlier that day, saying police had not been able to identify the suspect through security film, and asked my boyfriend if he had also received one. He hadn’t checked his email, but began talking about how the library bathroom seems like an unlikely place for an assault to occur, and how false reports are a thing. 

I agree with him that it is an unusual location, and false reports do happen, but inform him that the vast majority of reports are not false. (From what I have found, information indicates that between 2 and 10 % of all reports are false, and that over half of all assaults are not reported at all)

He knows that I have been sexually assaulted multiple times, and attempted to file a report with our school, who strongly discouraged me from doing so. This is an extremely common response from our university, their priority is reputation, not victims. Another issue. 

Anyway, he seemingly ignores my statement that false reports are uncommon, and instead starts telling me a story about a girl from his high school who apparently didn’t want to take an exam so she faked being abducted and raped, and got 4 years in jail because of it. 

I say again, a false report is statistically not the most likely situation. At this point he is just talking over me to argue about how false reports are real, and how I never listen to him. We’re standing outside the ice-cream store at the bottom of our building, where we had planned on stopping so I could buy us desert after he paid for dinner. Instead, I walk into our building and go back to my place. I send him a text saying I’m sorry for walking away, but that I thought he was being argumentative and insensitive. I gave him some time to cool off, and try to call him the next morning. He ignores my calls and sends me a text saying I’m toxic and never listen to him, and that we should break up."

19141,b38imj,GrimAutoZero,How do I go about completely getting over my ex.,"It’s been about a month and a half since my ex and I broke up. It wasn’t due to anything bad, she just decided that each of us shared a view that would cause issues later on in the future and wanted us to be able to be with others who shared our individual views(and yes before the breakup we had talked about the issue so it didn’t just come out of nowhere). Since it wasn’t a “bad” breakup we generally don’t have any bad feelings towards one another, but I still find myself missing them.

Looking at all the quirks, and memories we shared(only dated for about 11 months) it hurts to know they are almost a stranger and we will never make those memories. In trying not to look at it through rose colored glasses, we had a genuine love, and I can’t help but miss them/us so much. I understand in our current states it would be better in the long run, but I miss them horribly every day still.

We spend the rest of the day together with my cousin and his friends. Several times we broke off from the group and just went and talked. We shared bad puns and Dad Jokes. We talked about the losses we've had in life. And the words she said just resonated with me. After a brief moment of eye contact we kissed.

The night keeps moving on and I'll spare the remaining detail because they are graphic.

I am a middle-aged guy from a third-world country who is about to lose his journalism job in 10 days due to retrenchment in my current organisation.

The wife does not work. She is looking for a new job, but it alone may not be enough to sustain us.

To boot, I was last year diagnosed with depression, which I have now come to realise I have been struggling with it for more than two decades now, ever since my mom died when I was 12. 

That depression, coupled with expectations from home and mistreatment from my bosses at home and office -- wife at home and supervisor at work -- is making me feel worthless. Like I have no business here. Like there is no way I can contribute to society. 

I caught myself planning suicide at least thrice today. I need to get out of that process. I need help. I need to talk. Unfortunately,  I have neither the money to approach a professional nor a friend with whom I can discuss this at length.

*Long term*: Could you please help me find a way to find validation without negative thoughts?

31664,890ixw,MealReplacemetShake,How do I[34m] explain white male privilege to my son[5m]?,"My son has just started going to primary school and there is a black boy and girl in his class.    
How do I explain to him that he is privileged in comparison to those two? He doesn't understand the concept of whiteness so I'm thinking there must be a visual way to do this, like with picture cards.    
The reason I'm doing this now is, as an intersectional feminist and a male ally, I know my son being a white male like myself is probably going to become part of the problem. If I can educate him about his privilege at an early age, perhaps he will put oppressed people of colour and other minorities before himself and be a better ally than I ever could. 

So I'm reaching out to the Reddit community. I'd like to ask if there are any techniques for teaching such a young child this relatively complicated concept, and also how best to reach my goals of raising an aware feminist ally despite my child being born a white male.

I honestly think I should leave tonight and drive 45mins across state lines just to get away. 

My s/o is overly paranoid and our argument tonight started over the way I was planning to sleep. I laid down slanted making room for our cat and pulled out my phone to browse Reddit and a fight erupted over it. 

He got louder than a whisper and I had to compensate to even be heard because I am or at least feel so constantly judged. Then his roommate and landlord came out into the hall and told me to shut up even though my s/o had been on a 5minute rant about the past and what I do. 

I don’t know how to fix this and I honestly don’t see myself ever coming back here."

I did tonight, and I kept apologizing to him after because I’m so scared of him getting genital herpes. He said it was fine, and if it did happen, he would deal with the consequence. Does anyone know the likelihood of it actually happening? Unfortunately as well, he’s had infections down there too(which have gone away)so I hope that doesn’t make it more likely for him to get genital herpes "

32981,84gbs6,cooldawg11,Boyfriend of 5 years dumped me out of nowhere and I have no friends to talk to.,"My boyfriend (M20) and I (F21) had been together for about 5 years. It was by no means a perfect relationship but I thought that we were doing ok. I liked being around him an spending time with him. He lives about 30 mins away from me and I was always super excited driving over to his house every time. His  reason for breaking up was that he doesn't see a future with me and doesn't want to waste anymore time. I feel completely blind sided by this. He said that he spoke with him mom about it a few days ago and I'm not sure if that implies that he has only been thinking about this for a few days.. Im going to stop making assumptions but, I am just in shock. 

The bigger problem I have is that I don't have any friends to talk to about this. He was the only person that I talked to about anything and everything. Another issue for me is that whenever I would go out whether it was shopping, eating out or going for drinks it was only with him. Now, I am just completely panicked about the idea of having no one to talk to and no one to do things with. I don't see myself even leaving my house much anymore because I have nothing to do. This is making me feel really fucking upset and I have no clue how to handle this situation. 

I should add that I do have social anxiety and although I am taking medication it's not as easy as just going out and making friends and joining clubs and sports. I struggle a lot with making friends and keeping them.

I worked my first job in retail for 7+ years before having to leave due to medical issues. I then took a few months to recuperate, and now i’m ready to attempt working again with my new condition.

Are there any particular fields of work that would pair well with my condition and provide a safe place to be in the event of a seizure?

I’ve considered working from home, or even just doing odd jobs around town for people so that i could essentially work my own schedule around when i’m feeling well. But i’m not entirely against working out of house either, so long as i can feel safe in the random event of a seizure and not have my boss calling me an ambulance every time.

My work experience is mostly retail with the addition of holding a Pharmacy Tech License and working within pharmacy.

I also had an EMT License which i let expire, and the rest of my strengths are in my technological capabilities and not that it probably matters much but i’m a strong musician.

12309,c20nei,MikoNikoMiko,At the end of my rope with my weight and Mom,"Hi there,

I have a problem that I am unable to solve. My mother constantly gets on my case about my weight through snide comments. Things like, ""you need to lose that"" in regards to my stomach, ""stop eating so much"" if I grab a snack (even if it's something light like crackers), etc.

I've recently been exercising and taking a more serious approach to weight loss. I told my mother about it and shames my methods, claiming cycling won't do anything. Most recently, she used it against me and told me to go exercise in a negative way on a rest day.

Beyond this, she often judges what I wear. If it's anything remotely form fitting, she suggests I change my clothes. She'll sometimes look over me with clear intentions to mock but say nothing. As a result, my actual wardrobe is rather limited. She tells me I always wear the same clothes too.

The other day, she told me to stop eating when I went for a snack and I didn't take it well. It's been building up and I went to my room to cry. The next day, I was very sad, perhaps depressed, and had to leave work only 10 minutes into my shift due to just breaking down into tears.

I do so much for my mom. I pay more than half her rent, I pay for her TV (which I don't watch), I pay for her cell phone and I pay for internet too.

I was so hurt and upset I stopped eating for almost 3 days. A friend convinced me to eat and I had a small bowl of curry. It's all I've eaten in 4 days.

I've tried taking to my mom about this, but she treats it as a joke or just denies doing it. She'll focus on the small stuff and dismiss the harm it does overtime.

I recently blocked her from the wifi out of spite, hoping it would give her time to reflect. She does not work.

I just don't know what to do with my mom. I am overweight, but I don't think I should be harassed over it. My mom doesn't understand. I don't have enough money saved up to move out."

25438,92tbuv,FormalNameS,Should I say anything about a lazy co-worker?,"Okay, straight to the point. I work in low-skilled summer job while I'm out of university to earn some income, with an option of a job at the end of the road for Saturdays/Sundays. Not so recently a new co-worker joined whose pace is very slow and I'm concerned how this will affect employers view of me, this is because how my job works, it's that employers usually put us in pairs at the start of the day to complete tasks. Well, recently I started to be put with him (I'm suspecting the older guys know how to avoid him), how the tasks work in our job is that you have to try to complete them before the end of the day or finish as much as you can, well the guy just moves very slowly, when he does work it's low quality, he asks for 5 minutes every 10 minutes, he doesn't seem to care if we're completing the tasks we're set. And lord, if we do complete the tasks early he won't go to office to ask for another job (we've done enough even if an hour is left on the clock) Of the tasks we're given I do all my share and some of his because it's usually expected to help the other person if they didn't finish yet.

I would go to the employer and complain but these are my concerns:

* He's older than me and seems to be out of a job for a long time, this is just a summer job for me, who am I to take that?

* He says he has back problems, I believe him but he's lazy on other aspects where his back shouldn't affect him.

* I have no way to approach this and not seem like a dickhead. Do i start complaining about him? Do I ask to not be put with him? all of these are quite bad and won't help me get a job at the end of road. If the job is properly separated I could do my part and then wait untill he finishes his, but with his pace I will be waiting for hours doing nothing, and I can't go back to office to ask for another job as I've already mentioned it's expected to help out if you finish first."

24517,97pjuo,0haltja16,"I (16f) can’t shake the feeling that my family doesn’t want me around, what do I do?","I didn’t grow up around my family. For the majority of my life I lived with my emotionally abusive mother who moved me all over, so I didn’t really have a healthy relationship with my sisters (who lived with my father) or any of my grandparents, cousins, etc..

I now live with my dad and sisters, and I can feel the divide. My sisters always hang out and do stuff together. They are around my age (17, Suzan, and 18, Kelly), so it’s not an age thing. They just don’t seem to want me around. Just tonight Kelly asked Suzan to hang out in her room, but didn’t even acknowledge my presence. When she does invite me or include me it’s actually surprising, or she’ll invite me and Suzan, but they ignore me for most of the time. It got to a point where I made new friends when she took me and Kelly to a water park so I would have someone to actually talk to, because they were off on their own.

My other family members adore my siblings. They’re invited places and go out and do stuff with my aunts, uncles, and cousins, but never me. My aunt had Suzan babysit for a week, and she received a brand new (expensive) camera. I babysat for a week the following summer and I got a coloring book. It’s not really about the gifts as much as it was that I felt as though my time wasn’t valued as much as hers.

At Christmas dinner I was the babysitter for two younger children. I had to sit at the kids table, and when I politely asked to play cards I was snapped at and told no even though I could have easily joined the game. Again, I understand that the children needed to be watched, but there were other people who could’ve watched the kids that weren’t doing anything at the time, plus I had been watching them all night.

The other day I returned from my friends birthday party, and when I got in my family made me clean up the stuff from the bonfire that they had left out, because I made one s’more when I got home. They guilt tripped me into it by bringing up stuff that I had done wrong in the past few days, then when I was out there they told me to make s’mores for my aunt, on a fire that had already gone out, instead of her coming outside to make it how she very specifically wanted (aka the perfect golden color that is hard to get)

I think that the worst thing, though, is that every year my grandmother takes my sisters out to eat for their birthdays, a family friend also does this, and both people have completely forgotten my birthday. It’s been 8 months since my birthday, and they never remembered. I would’ve felt too awkward to mention it, but it hurts so much because everyone makes me feel insignificant compared to my sisters.

I have never really told any of my family members how much this affects me, but I’m starting to wonder if they would be happier without me. I don’t believe that I’ve done anything to warrant this, and I always try to be polite to them, but I still can’t help but feel like they don’t want me around. Should I talk to someone, or just leave it be and try to get over it?"
23203,9e948p,throwmeaway14231423,Why does everyone hate me?,"TL;DR: I always get bullied wherever I go. Maybe its my personality? I'm pretty quiet and keep to myself a lot. People generally feel the need to harass me or get angry with me. Wondering what's going on. Am aware that I guess I shouldn't let it get to me, but you know, it's still pretty hard when everyone seems to have a problem with me. Need some insight or advice on how to go about it.

Hi everyone,

I had a long history of getting bullied in school and stuff and a lot of crap going on at home. Over time, people begin harassing me for no reason? Like I got in trouble with the principal, the dean, my parents just cause someone wanted to pick a fight with me. I'm generally very quiet and reserved, though sometimes, I can make people laugh a lot and have a fun time. Usually, I just keep to myself though, as its most comfortable. My parents feel the need to utterly disrespect me for no good reason? (like waking me up when I sleep, telling me to stfu when I ask them questions, saying I dress like a homeless person) They also have a desire to hit me sometimes, among other things.

At school, I get a lot of bullies trying to mess with me. My roommates for last year in college were total jerks, constantly throwing insults or sometimes attacking me. It started okay in the beginning, but as time went on they just wanted me to do this or do that. I eventually did do some drinking (one time) and got caught (the one time I did it), so there's that. Sent to the deans office and basically got interrogated (got sent twice).

All my middle school and high school years weren't great either. Had a lot of really annoying people that just won't stop harassing me (name-calling, sly insults) or straight up attacks (pulling my chair or throwing stuff at me). Wasn't helpful I didn't look very good or anything (had a lot of pimples and was fat cause of a lot of fast food).

Lately I've been wondering why this seems to be basically throughout my entire life. Been wondering why everyone seems to hate me. Maybe I did something to them or something like that? I don't really know what I did. I just tried to keep to myself and sometimes try to make friends, though, it seems like that impossible. 

Right now, I just feel like not being social at all. Feels like that feeling has been crushed, so has my self-esteem and everything. It feels pretty crappy to not have anything going for me. I don't know why this seems to be the pattern of my life, but I guess it is. Feels like everyone really does hate me for some reason. What's going on here?"

I say I was dumb because obviously news this juicy doesn't stay under wraps for long and I get a text from her boyfriend. It turns out he was also planning to propose on this vacation.

So we are both kind of stuck in this weird spot. We are thinking that no girl wants to have to share her proposal day with someone else - it's supposed to be her special day that happens once in her life and having someone so close to you also have this day is kind of thunder stealing. We also think that even if it isn't the same day, having two proposals on the same vacation feels like it might make one feel cheapened. I think you could feel bad regardless if you were proposed to first or second.

39207,7kf1ug,goldenrose15,Why could an ex be harassing you?,"Okay, so I feel like I am being harassed by my ex.

We broke up back in March after I realized he was not the one for me. He suddenly started insulting my appearance, manners, dared to insult my career choices and, well, you get the picture. He basically said our relationship is not going the way he wanted it to go as we were closing to a year of being together, because I wasn't good enough for him.

It ended badly, the break up itself was happening for a month. He begged me for a second chance when I was breaking up with him and somehow he starting treating me even worse after that.

Overtime, there was a lot of emotional abuse, insults, manipulation, suicide threats and such blunt phylosophical statements(all him) on why I am emotionally disabled in some way, unable to compromise and stuff like that. Eventually I removed him from facebook and blocked him. He started sending me messages through viber.

Its always super bipolar. He insults me, pointing out how I am beneath him and have no room in his life, then somehow he mentions that he still loves me, then adding that I however, do not have a clue what that means. 
Today he actually messaged me with threats that no lawyer will ever save me if I dont send him back a Star Wars t-shirt that I custom made for him for his birthday. Like, he went with this super cruel discourse. 

I think since we broke up he has been sleeping around, however from what I understand he has sworn off relationships, as one of the things he wrote to me was that he doesn't need one now as his happiness no longer depends on anyone other than himself. 

What I am asking is - should I be afraid of him? What could be the explanation of this strange behaviour? I feel really scared now that I blocked him on Viber too that next time he feels like insulting me he is just gonna come over my house. And his cruel and aggresive behaviour actually made me tell him that I will send him his t-shirt back.

Is he mentally ill or is it me? I just want to move on in peace, I have been so happy in my life recently, I've been in this place where I feel like I've learned so much and that I am finally able to find someone to have a grown up relationship with... But he appears and scares me.

I am over him, I mean, once you've been treated that way (of which he mentioned he is proud to have done) you become pretty sure that this is not the person to share your life with. But I am scared that he will physically hurt me, murder me out of spite or something. 

Can you guys help me sort this out? "
11075,c8jkwn,SpookyKnees,How do I stop thinking about dying?,"Lately I just can't seem to get this topic out of my head. Im 19 years old, I have an amazing boyfriend, we just moved across the country together to Oregon and we are just so happy, I'm so lucky to live here and be alive.

25176,94bovq,Lost_pls_Help,In a bad family situation don't know how to handle it,"So for starters this is a throw away account and sorry for the long post this has been weighing on me for a long time.

This all starts with my Sisters BD(Baby Daddy) I'd like to add him and my Sister have been together since they were in elementary school and based on what everyone I've talked to said he's been a shitty person and has always deliberately mistreated my sister

But my earliest memory is of him tormenting my Chihuahua by chasing him aggressively around my house as my whole family laughed and I, 5 at the time, tried to stop him so I already had a bad image

So for some quick context I didn't have my own room so me and my Mother shared a bed for most of my younger life, now jump to 3 years later and my whole family is going on a camping trip, my mother included which was weird since she would never go camping with us but I was a kid so I was happy

Anyways night rolls around and its fairly early but my Mother tells me to go to bed and after some arguing I do, only to be woken up in the middle of the night to my Sisters BD and my Mother having sex right next to me, as an 8 year old at the time it took me a bit to process what was going on but after I did all I could do was lie there crying and shaking until the sun rose the whole time hoping my Mother would notice and stop(I now even to this day get violent shakes anytime I'm extremely uncomfortable with anything)

So this goes on for another 3 years of him and my mother casually fooling around behind my sisters back and my Mother was convinced I had no idea what anything sexual was so she would continually do these things even when I was around(even if i was sitting right there it consisted of them making out her telling him she was gonna suck his dick then angrily telling me to go away them dry humping each other) I've blocked out so much of my childhood because of this

I also began suffering from extreme anger outburst around this time and sadly that has stuck with my for most of my life

Well all of this pretty much came to a stop when I was about 11 only because the BD got my sister pregnant and then disappeared, only to follow with years of him refusing to be apart of the kids life refusing to pay child support as well as everyone so often calling my sisters to berate her with insults and telling her that him and his wife(at the time) were going to take custody of her  child

Well he finally leaves the picture completely and around a year after I graduate I start to feel like maybe I don't have to hate my Mother as much as I do and can at least try to pretend like we're a family, and it was going surprisingly nice and I started to think maybe I could get over it

At the end of last year my Sisters BD was left by his wife and two kids, so guess who started to think he could show his face around our house?

And my sister with absolutely no morals decided that they were gonna be bang buddies and so he started to come around for the to hook up, let it be know this is in a house with my Sister her Son our Mother and myself that was Very thin walls, so I'm absolutely livid and to put a cherry on top Me my sister and her son went on a trip for a day out of town and the moment we were out of town he texted my Mother saying,"" Im Lonely I Love You Please let Me comer over!!"" thankfully she replied that she doesnt want to talk to him unless it was about his son and I thought well maybe things wont turn back to how they were

But, low and behold they kept casually texting my Mother didnt even add him as a contact keeping him as just numbers

After me and her got into an argument and I said that she actually likes Sisters BD A LOT she deleted all of her messages wih him and it ""appears"" they are no longer texting

Now things have escalated though, my family knows my hate for this guy but my sister is basically letting him stay here for DAYS at a time and slowly im seeing him and my Mother getting closer and closer again

The only thing thats been running through my head is that Im already 23 so I need to move out and cut all ties with my family

I also considered telling my sister but my Sister is connected to my Mother at the hip so revealing this is basically gonna ruin my whole family...

I dont want to keep living in Anger and Hate, but I have no idea what to do...

Thank you for actually Reading all of this and sorry for dragging on

Any and All Help is appreciated

TL;DR: My Sisters Baby Daddy has been fooling around with my Mother for years and idk what to do."

I just started my junior year of high school and even though I’ve never liked it, all of a sudden, I despise everything about it. I’m always anxious throughout any of my classes. My hands get sweaty and tingly, my stomach will get upset, I’ll have so many thoughts racing inside my head. It’s such a miserable school day and I know you may think that whatever causes my stress is irrational, but it’s me and I can’t help it. I got almost all A’s last year. My first two years of high school, I’m around an A- student. But I’m afraid of denial into college. The college I have my eyes on isn’t a hard college to get in. Around 70 applicants get admitted. Plus, I’ve taken and am currently not taking any AP/honors classes. And I’m not the best standardized test-taker. I got a 21 on the pre-ACT in April earlier this year. Plus, I’ve heard talk about how it was so much easier than the actual ACT. I’m not that good at algebra. I’m not the best reader. And we all know the ACT is what colleges care about most now. I’m just curious whether my perspective on school should be as dramatic as I make it. I don’t know how to manage my stress and it’s such a burden on my life. I’m constantly thinking about it... thank you in advance

TL;DR

I’m a chronic worrier that stresses constantly (outside of school, such as right now) about my grades and future after high school"
22676,9gefee,Her0icFern,How might I take my mind off this person I know is taken?,"So... for close to a month now, there's been... someone... that I find it difficult to stop thinking about. But I want to think about other women, and she has a genuinely lovely relationship with another guy who I also really like. But, after speaking to her for a long time in a situation I couldn't really escape (ie, a six hour car journey), I discovered we had an awful lot in common (like, more than anyone in that group, bar perhaps her boyfriend, who is a top bloke). But more to the point, she actually takes genuine interest in the stuff I talk about, and when I'm used to a lot of what I say being either too nerdy or too intense for most people, having someone drop all pretense and take interest like that is like kryptonite for me. That, plus she is extremely smart, and is into an awful lot of the nerdy esoteric shit I'm into, which, again, is like kryptonite. She is also an extremely responsible and consciensious person. Again, kryptonite.   


So after heading home, I did as much as I could to distract myself and think about other things, but I could not get the following off my mind; *Of any of the women I've come accross, no one comes close to being exactly what I would want as she.*  
I guess a bit later I was able to put my mind to other things for a bit, but now I'm back at uni, and here's the problem; I'm on a committee of a club, which she is also on.  This means I can't really avoid her, because we have to meet regularly to make sure that club doesn't go to shit. I know that's probably the best thing in terms of taking her off my mind, but it's not really an option for me. Like, this weekend I did committee training again, and for the whole two days I couldn't remove myself, and as is often the case, it's when you leave that you can't take the thoughts off your mind. I just worry this cycle may continue, and I'll have difficulty moving on.

3078,ddnd1b,eli153316,Roomate Advice: Serious odor,"I've been having an issue with my roomate, and was wondering if y'all had any advice.

I'm a first year in college and have been living with my roommate for around 1 month. The first day he moved in, I noticed his smell. It's hard to describe, but it is musty and unpleasant.

I have recently had friends over who have said that the smell is almost unbearable to be in my room for more than a minute or two. The smell is very localized to him. When he is not in the room, I can spray some febreeze and air it out. However, I'm worried that with winter coming I won't be able to leave the windows open for an extended period of time.

I currently have been spraying febreeze and using an essential oil diffuser to make the room smell better, but it isn't working nearly enough and I don't feel comfortable spraying it when he is in the room.

I have spoken to my RA about the issue and ideally would like to find a solution that doesn't involve a room change.

I was wondering if any of you had ideas or solutions for more serious odor problems. I'm pretty desperate to try anything."
10080,cdazzz,redlight__,The one and only bully l ever had lives with me. What should I do.,"Guys, I really can’t anymore to be honest. I never wanted to talk about this to anyone but I’m 17 and I’m in a really tough situation. I live in Morocco and I basically have the most toxic and harmful family ever! As seen in the title There is a bully which happens to be my dad. I can’t stand him anymore (which is weird) but I really feel so bad because I do cause I see my friends having these amazing relationships with their fathers but I’m just in a really tough situation. Well it’s mainly because of culture and where I stand in the family.
You see I’m against what culture in Morocco is like. In here, first male child is supposed to take care of the family, which in my opinion is just BS but my dad does so yeah... So this meant that I have to basically nod my head and do everything my father tells me, and if I do not, my mom gets shit for it (he sometimes hits her), I get called a failure, and my whole family gets a tough week. 
But here’s where it gets far. I realize that I might not be the most fit person and he knows that people commenting on this is bugs me. (The reason being is that I had surgery and I basically couldn’t do anything but eat and sit/sleep for like 10 months). So whenever he gets to his arguing phase WHICH IS DAILY, he tries to always bring up everyone’s insecurities and so that makes him the bigger person and when his ego is cured, that’s where he leaves for sleep. Making my mom a scape goat. 
Here is where the solutions are narrowed. We are 4 kids in the family (and because of culture) and my dad is the provider of the family so she can’t leave him because he always threatens to not pay for us. And for me, I can’t really take loans to go to college because that’s not how it works in Morocco, so I have to depend on his money too. My mom always asks me to do whatever none-sense he wants me to but I’m absolutely tired because it doesn’t end. First, (as a normal parent should), wanted me to get very good grades in my school: which I did, then he wanted me come home at 9PM: which I did. Then he wanted me to start sleeping at 10: which I did (this is including weekends), then he wanted me to start praying as a muslim: which I’m struggling with because I’m not at the right mindset at the moment, then he wants me to walk for a total of 2h a day: which then I I miss it for 1 day, he starts screaming at my family, tells his friends I’m a failure and starts insulting everyone. 
And it’s especially his insults that hurt the most. I can’t really do anything because he CAN kick me out of the house and he WILL, he just has to find the right time. I feel like he doesn’t care about me but how he can go and tell others about me.
You see my dad doesn’t have a job, he’s 47 btw but he made enough money where he can literally just chill wherever he wants, whenever he wants. So he rubs the daily screaming and shouting at us, and it leaves us defenseless cause we need him as a source of income so all my siblings can have the future we deserve. 
I really don’t know what to do. I wish I could just spit in his face and leave to have a family and bring my siblings and mom with me with their own deserved house and life. I mean don’t get me wrong, we are not perfect: my mom, I feel like is closest to perfect because even when she lies, it’s to hide the mistakes that my siblings make. But for us, we don’t deserve the shit my fathers gives us. (I’m so sorry for the super long rant, but I really just want to see people’s opinions and views and most importantly advice on this) 
PS 
Money isn’t everything guys, please trust that. It’s one thing to be wealthy, but it won’t matter if you are just a miserable person. I’m one that always tries to see the good in people but I couldn’t with my bully, and so I never value anything he really does because what his income is, is just a number but what he is, is a douchebag."

I asked my date about a month ago when we got information on it, someone who I've known for five years, we're friends and have similar interests - she's very good looking (which is one reason I asked her). Anyway, I started dating a girl on New Years who I've known for a year and really like, we've been seeing each other almost every second day. So now I'm faced with the issue of not being able to bring my girlfriend and bringing someone who I haven't seen all summer (but still talked to).

21047,atgzza,CuriouslyPotato,I think I overreacted and now my best friend won’t speak to me. My fault or a bad coincidence?,"The back story starts like this, a month ago a friend of a few years and I had gotten that emoji on Snapchat that shows you both talk to each other the most. It lasted all through January and then disappeared after we didn’t talk for two days straight for some unknown reason. Not going to lie it hurt my feelings pretty badly, but I didn’t do anything about the actual emoji and for ask him if he was alright. 

It came back, and I was fine for a week. It would come and go, and I was a little bit bothered by that even though I had no right to. I at first didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to come off as too clingy, but then something made me point it out. All he said was that he was all over the place, which was understandable because I knew he is dealing with some though shit right now, but I was still unsure so the next day I asked what he had meant. He explained and then I explained why I liked having the emoji there and how it made me feel like I mattered to him. 

Later that night I asked to hang out a few days later, and he said he couldn’t. An hour later I was about to send him a message when he sent a paragraph explaining that he needed a break and would talk to me again in a few months. I immediately felt my heart shatter because I knew deep down that it was probably because of what I had said regarding the emoji. I tried to ask what was wrong and apologize, but got ignored.I had said a similar thing a month before and he took it much different, saying it was understandable and comforting me by saying that really it didn’t mean anything and that it wasn’t like we weren’t talking every day, so I figured when I said it this time it would end up just the same.

 I was wrong I guess. 

Now I have to deal with the guilt and confusion of wondering if it was because I mentioned the emoji being gone or really if he will ever speak to me again. I tried sending him something today, but got left on read again and now I truly think he just wants me to go away for good.


Am I overreacting in believing this was because of me and that he’s angry? Or could it have been a coincidence and have nothing to do with me? I really just don’t know how to handle this or what to do, and I’m convinced I ruined everything. Help.




**Tl;dr:** I pointed out to a friend of many years that the emoji on snap that shows you talk to each other the most was gone. Now they are taking a “break” and won’t talk to me at all. Now I feel like totally ruined our relationship.

For context, I am a 22yo female, studying at university and working. 

In some situations I have justification for why I think they don't like me, for example, my ex boyfriend made it his mission to tell all our mutual friends all the horrible things I allegedly did. 

In other situations, I may have only talked to the person a handful of times, but still feel they think I am slightly distasteful for reasons x, y and z - despite no reason for them to really think that.

Sometimes I even think my sister don't like me, yet we talk every day.

Does anyone else feel like this? Why do you think this happens and how do I stop myself believing it so much?"
14667,bqvdh4,rockman883,I may lose my dog," 

This is my first time using Reddit but for the last several years ive been at a loss at what to do. My mom married a man and he became a permanent member of our household and proved himself to be consistently verbal and sometimes violent. sometimes I will do minuscule things that make him mad and his level of anger could be anywhere from getting a red face and murmuring about how im annoying him or he will start screaming at the top of his lungs breaking things and then complaining later on about how everything is broken. 

After two years we decided to get a dog and this dog would soon become one of my best friends that I would honestly consider a child. My parents treated the dog terribly for a year keeping him in a cage in a wooden shed outside of the house through summer and winter while I was out a school and my parents were at work. I was against this and it bothered me very much but my word and opinion to my parents was meaningless until we got another dog. After we got this dog my parents started treating our first dog better and I finally had the chance to give my dogs a good life and I could finally treat them like they were a part of my family. as this was happening my stepfather was becoming more and more controlling over everything and everyone and it was taking an even bigger toll on me. I've been chronically depressed and nonfunctional for many years but I don't need sympathy it was just another reason of why he needs to go. I've seen him abusing the dogs many times and I've seen him disregarding their well-being more times than I can count he puts not only me and my mothers sanity at risk but the dogs health as well. 

I was 12 when all of this started and im 18 now and both me and my mother agree he needs to go but the issue is that he has ownership over both of the dogs and if he goes my babies go as well. He is the owner on there certificate and he also paid for most of their vet bills but no matter how much he paid for them he has and always will cause more harm than good to everyone in the house. The verbal abuse is getting to the point where I can't leave my room anymore and I've stopped going to school and I quit my job because of my depression im almost always considering suicide but I can't stand the thought of leaving my dogs with an awful life. The same goes for my mother as he often mocks her about being physically abused in her last marriage saying ""no wonder your ex beat the shit out of you"". 

This has been going on for too long and has heavily impacted every aspect of my existence I need to get my life together and start working and getting an education again and something needs to happen. I love my dogs more than anyone or anything I've trained them loved them I take care of any cuts, bruises, ticks, bug bites, etc and losing them would take away my purpose. I don't need any sympathy but I need any kind of answer or advice and I want to thank anyone who takes the time to read or consider this in advance.   "

36212,7tpvkc,caesarbrothertohuman,Munchausen by Proxy?," I met my SO 4 years ago and together we have a blended family of five kids, ages 2-11. My SO has a sister with some weird behavioral issues. She has two sons, ages 9 and 11. I've never had an issue with her, aside from thinking she was a little off. She would do weird things like tell me she has diabetes or that she's lactose intolerant but when I'd mention it to my SO he would say she's just a bullshitter. She would do things like shake violently and say her blood sugar is low and have her son feed her something from my pantry because she was shaking too violently to feed herself. Honestly she just looked ridiculous, my family is double chin deep in diabetes and I know what hypoglycemia looks like. It was pretty obvious to me at that point that she was full of it, but I was embarrassed for her so I didn't say anything.

Eventually I realized she was making up shit about her kids too. It started when the boys were at our house one weekend and I asked them what they wanted to be when they grew up. The youngest one said ""I probably won't have a job because I'll have to take care of my brother"" I asked what he meant and he said that since his brother is disabled his mom says that he'll need to help care for him when they're adults. I had no idea what he was talking about as clearly neither of them are disabled. They're both healthy, functioning, smart boys. I asked his mom about it and she said that the older one has autism. I didn't really see it myself, but okay. Since then she's said he has OCD, ADHD, ODD, aspergers, epilepsy, tourette syndrome, deafness in one ear, color blindness, depression and amnesia (yes, actual amnesia). She's said her older son has slipped discs in his back and has to sleep on special mattresses (this was explained to me after a slumber party at our house in which he slept on the couch). All bullshit. Neither of them are on any meds and neither have been diagnosed with anything. They're just perfectly normal kids.

This year she moved closer to us and our kids go to the same school. We have 4 children in the same grade. Unbeknownst to me until recently, at school registration this year she noticed that her sons were in separate classes while my daughters were in the same class. She spoke to a coordinator and had my daughter moved out of her class and into her ""special needs"" sons class, so that she could be his ""helper"". 

The final straw was last night. She's always made little remarks to me about my kids ""kid 2 seems like she might have ocd"" ""kid 5 is going to be on the spectrum"". I've just ignored it, I don't like confrontation. But last night my kids slept over at their place and this morning my 11 year old tells me that she gave my 6 year old an allergy pill and when my 11 year old asked her why she gave it to her she said because she has ADHD and has trouble getting to sleep. Not cool. 

Idk what to do here, she obviously has severe mental issues. She's ruining her children, and now she's starting in on my children. I don't like drama, I don't really think I could ever confront her about this. Cowardly, maybe, but I'm just not one to confront people. I've spoken to my children about the dangers of taking medicine when it's not necessary and I've told my 6 year-old that there's nothing wrong with her and that if she had a disorder a doctor would tell her, not a family member, but what about *her* kids? And herself for that matter? Aside from the twisted medical crap, she's a decent person who obviously needs help. Does this all seem like munchausen by proxy? Is there anything I can actually do for them? Anyone I can contact? Anyone dealt with someone like this?  Thanks!

(Long post)","I have this for 2 years now where suddenly I don't see where my life is going, i dont really see a future for myself. Due to this i had a hard time being productive, and spend most of my days feeling empty  just literally waiting for the day to end. It went alarming for both my parents and my academics so i was forwarded to different counselors in my uni due to depression. I'm not officially diagnosed and i don't want to think of it that way.
I wasnt really functioning during those times and it went to the point where im getting too much attention from different relationships, specially my family. It got really annoying to me so I tried my best to slowly progress to show them that I'm not depressed anymore (so they say). Fast forward to today, i graduated college just 2 months ago, originally after graduating I told my mom I wanted to take the licensure exams. They were supportive of it and they enrolled me in a review center. I also have a fair paying office job that offered me a flexible schedule. This would be a dream for others, everything's going good with my life. But I'm just not happy. I lost commitment and interest in taking the licensure exams and thus I stopped attending classes. I lied to my mom and told her that i wanted to focus on my job. she was mad disappointed, and still wants me to take the exam despite my lack of interest. I dont know where to go from here. I'm afraid because i dont know whats next for me, im afraid because one day i might just lose commitment in my job as well and disappoint my mom even more. Whats the next step for me?"

My little brother is a good kid but he’s out of control. He’s been arrested once for breaking an entry with his friends. Last night he got arrested for DUI. Those both happened in time span less than a month. He drives recklessly, he’s been in two major crashes. He likes to speed. He regularly gets into fights.Whenever, he doesn’t pick up his phone, my mom and I are worried sick.

My parents are divorced and my dad isn’t around to straighten him up and he doesn’t listen to me and my mom. We took the car away from him but his friends let him borrow theirs. We’re expats living in a country where it’s very easy to have our rights abused and his friends are nice kids too but they’re just rich locals who can get away with dumb shit. I don’t know how to deal with him and my mom is irrational she would yell and scream and get angry. Now he’s been detained since last night for his DUI and we don’t know anything because they won’t tell us. Laws aren’t so clear here."

26095,8zak8o,bellanoire13,Father is restricting my work attire,"I am a 15 year old female who works as a professional lifeguard. The company states that the work attire required is to wear a black one piece swimsuit and the provided lifeguard shirts into the pool complex. Once inside we are still required to wear the swimsuit, but the shirt is optional. We are allowed to also wear black athletic shorts, but it’s an optional decision, not required.

My father noticed yesterday that I don’t wear the shorts while i’m working and is now requiring me to wear them by threatening to not let me work. 

I feel this is unreasonable as I wear a normal black one piece suit (which isn’t overly revealing by any means) and its part of the allowed dress code. Everyone else in my work, including the managers and owners, tend to only wear the swimsuits, and not shorts.

We have no religious reasons for covering skin. Also, it’s uncomfortable to wear them as I often get wet at work and the shorts don’t allow my suit underneath to dry. Similarly, it feels unhygienic to sit in a wet swimsuit/shorts for up to 12 hours at a time in the heat.

What can I do to convince my father that I don’t need to wear the shorts and that he’s being unreasonable?

tldr; My father is requiring me to wear shorts at my work (lifeguarding) where it’s not required and I feel he’s being unreasonable."

But she added me to some group with some of her friends and that's when things started to get fucked up because she would actively ignore me while talking in that group. She was friendly and talked to me at school tho.


So like a week ago she ignored me for two days straight and i was like hey is everything okay between us etc.


She said that she's in a really bad mood and doesn't want to yell at me? And then kept talking to people in the group chat and sending videos of her dancing and being silly with captions ""i don't know what's wrong with me xD"" and shit like that.



Of course i started to panic and started sending messages checking if she's mad at me or something. It took her like 12 minutes to respond even though she saw i was being really nervous, while i was panicking she sent another video of her dancing or some shit.



Well yeah, she started talking to me and said i was too paranoid and made a joke about me being too depressed with that depressed kermit meme. I got mad and started ignoring her at school for like a week etc, she tried to talk to me and was telling people i am salty.


Well today i was like ""hey if u wanna be friends again thats fine by me"" and she said ""finally"" and yeahhhh, she started leaving me on ""seen"" again, even when i asked her ""hey why are you leaving me on seen so much?""


I really can't decide if i'm just really clingey and anxious or if she's  just manipulative and an asshole.


Should i try to work on myself and be friends with her without it bothering me or is this her fault? I seriously can't tell."

For the past three days, my house has been terrorized by swarms of regular house flies. I'll come home and there'll be 15-20 buzzing around next to every window on the first floor (but not the second floor or the basement). For context, there are around 10 windows, including 2 huge arched windows that are near the ceiling. We killed every fly we could find on the first day, and they came back the second day, if not even more than there had been on the first day. The second day, we inspected our carpets and vents on the first floor looking for fly eggs, and found a few little black rice grain-shaped things - we disposed of them and then massacred the flies again. We even put up one of those fly trap bags, then on the third day we came home and there were more fucking flies dear god.

Has anyone had this problem before and if so do you have any idea where could the flies possibly be reproducing from or hiding their eggs??? We vacuumed the whole first floor and tried hard to get rid of any dust or cobwebby stuff - we also disposed of the stuff outside."

My family has been shuffling me around to doctors appointments and and keeping my secret but I know they want me to tell people, especially because I won't let them tell our family yet. 
I don't want things to change and I feel like this is my coping mechanism, to be able to finish my first high school year without people treating me weird, I want people to treat me as though I'm the same person I was three weeks ago before the fateful news. 
I just want to feel normal for just a little while longer 
I feel guilt for being sick, which sounds awful but I have so many amazing friends and I know so many people lean on me just to make it through the day I don't know how I could tell them that I might have cancer 
Don't get me wrong I'm not leaving people in the dark, I do have a heart disorder which I have had no problem telling them about and they have been taking that news fairly well, I just don't want to have to look into my best friend's eye (F15) and tell her I have brain cancer, which is what the doctors are suspecting and looking for. 
I just don't want to do this to my parents and talking about it makes it too real, I feel like its some how my fault that if I hadn't said anything this wouldn't have happened.
I asked my doctor if the tests come back positive to with hold treatment until the summer, if I've been sick for this long what's a few more weeks gonna do. 
They already pulled me out of Physical Education and gave me a hall pass to take the elevator, I basically sit and do nothing for two hours everyday at school while I watch my team do what I love

15175,bo3hl5,thekekkles,Is it stupid to quit my job due to stress/for wanting to better myself?,"Hi Reddit, so for the past few months I have been extremely stressed out at work. Probably since around Thanksgiving of 2018. The work load has just been immense with no breaks, I feel like I’m suffocating and I honestly dread waking up in the morning cause I quite frankly, don’t want to go to work for fear of not meeting my quota. (For context I do background screening, mostly for employment purposes. Can’t say much else per company policy.)  

I’ve been struggling with my weight a lot recently too, and I am a heavy stress eater so all of the stuff at work has certainly not been helping me in that regard. I really want to be a personal trainer though, as I feel it’s a job that I would enjoy as I could actively help people improve their lives on a daily basis. But that’s not a goal that feels achievable with my current job, because my current job is all I can think about most of the time. Even on Friday night when I’m off for the weekend I can’t help but think “just over 48 hours and I’m back to work”.

I have a fairly supportive family and a bit of money saved up, so I mostly just want to know, as the title says... is this a stupid reason to want to leave a job? Cause when I think about it I really get stuck with that “You need to work, your body comes later” kind of mentality.

Thank you ahead of time Reddit, I might not have time to reply to any comments for awhile as I am currently at work, but I will be reading. Thank you again."
7852,cod1yb,TIDLIN,How can I go to college?,"I’m a junior in High school. I currently have a part time job at my local grocery store, I make 8 dollars an hour and I usually work about 26 hours a week. 

I’m trying my best to save for college, but everyday I become more and more discouraged. 
I’m discouraged because I feel like no matter how many hours I work, or how much I save, I’ll never have the luxury of getting a higher education. 

I live with my single mom, who flat out told me that she can’t pay for my college. This was such a shock because all of my schooling I’ve gotten really good grades, taken AP classes and done extracurriculars (for the sake of getting accepted into my dream school). I never thought I wouldn’t be able to go to college.

My boyfriend and many of my friends parents are shelling out thousands so their kid can go to college but my mother and I live paycheck to paycheck. 

I know scholarships and fafsa are things but that can’t cover it all. I’m saving around $350 every two weeks for college but I feel like it’ll never be enough. 

Any advice?"
25389,931hju,throwaway7758832,My sister kissed me and I'm not sure what to do.,"So a little bit of a story. Sorry if it’s a little long. 

I live with my parents and my older sister (she’s almost 18, I’m 15). She and I get along really well for the most part, and we hang out pretty often. A couple nights ago, she came to my room and invited me to come watch a movie with her. It was close to 10pm and I was pretty tired, but I accepted cause I never turn down a movie. It was weird she was inviting me that late but I  didn’t think to much about it. 

We were in the living room on our couch under a blanket, we had the lights off, and my parents were upstairs. I was cuddled up to her, which is pretty common for us, and just kind of dozing. I wasn’t really keeping up with the movie but I was enjoying her company anyway. 

At some point, it must have been about an hour in, she puts her hand on my chin (gently) and kisses me on the lips. I didn’t fight her at first, I didn’t really know how to react. She kisses me a little harder and puts her hand on my breast. The whole thing was pretty gentle. It didn’t feel like she was forcing herself on me, I guess. I pulled away and asked her what she was doing. She didn’t say anything and darted away back upstairs and slams the door. 

This was about three days ago, and she hasn’t talked to me since. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to go to my parents because I don’t want her to get in trouble. I don’t know how to feel about any of this. Was I molested? Am I overreacting? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.  "

We started talking all day at work (co-workers hate it) then we started texting at night. Then we started hanging out in secret. We never had sex but we have fooled around a few times. We have called it off so many y times and always end up back together. She told me she loves me a few weeks ago. I've known from the very beginning I love her.  The guilt of this kills her but we can't stay away from each other.

8461,clayed,Venoisard,My roommate insists on keeping a dog despite (in my opinion) not being able to properly take care of her. How can I convince him to give her up to a better home?,"So this all started a little over two months ago when one of my roommate's coworkers asked him to watch a dog for about 2-4 weeks while their house was renovated. He ran the idea by me and I said I was fine with that so we took the dog in. 

Cut to about a month later and this coworker has stopped showing up to work and despite my roommate's asking, no one has seen or heard from her at all. It seems that she skipped out on her job and dumped the dog on us. 

My roommate and I came to an agreement to wait until the end of July to see if she showed back up and if she didn't we would take the dog to a no-kill animal shelter and put her up for adoption where she'll hopefully find a better home.

Now here we are in early August and I asked him about the situation and now he's changed his tune and wants to keep it. Under other circumstances I'd be fine with it, however I believe we're not fit to care for it.

To start, my roommate works 10 hour days and says he'd just keep the dog in a cage during his work hours despite the dog having obvious issues being left alone. She will whine and cry after being left alone for only a few minutes so the idea of leaving her in a cage all day like that seems like abuse to me. My roommate is also infamous for his terrible memory and has forgotten to feed her multiple times until I've reminded him and once he forgot her outside for about an hour in the middle of the night (she's inside all the time except to relieve herself) until I found out. I have also had two cats for years and the dog doesn't get along with them very well. This isn't the dog's fault as she just wants to play, but my cats are terrified of this larger animal chasing them when she gets excited. The dog is also so excitable that she's prone to chewing on anything she can and has already destroyed some valuable electronics so I'm incredibly wary about letting her out of my sight for more that a few moments.

Another aspect of this issue is my situation. I'm currently unemployed and without a vehicle so I'm at home pretty much constantly which means during the week I'm almost solely responsible for this dog. For reasons mentioned prior I really don't want to keep this dog, but since my roommate pays all the bills right now he holds all the power in this dynamic and doesn't bother considering my opinion on the issue.

So if it stays then it'll exclusively be his dog and either he keeps her constantly and she suffers from what I believe to be abuse or she's left to me when I really don't want to keep her and think she should be in a better home with people who can take care of her and genuinely want her. I think it's unfair that this dog is being forced on me without my consent and now might be permanent.

After all that information I want to know how to convince him to relieve this dog to a better home despite me explaining this all to him before and him ignoring these points. Do I let him keep it and report him to authorities? Take the dog to a shelter without his knowledge? Or is there an aspect to this I've misunderstood and I'm in the wrong?

TL;DR: Roommate wants to keep dog he can't care for properly and I don't want to."
16701,bgqnal,trynamoveouttahere,How do I apply to jobs out of state/How do I tell my boss and coworkers I am moving?," 

Hello! This is my first ever post on reddit. I have a few questions regarding moving jobs/places and thought this might be the place to go.

I graduated from college last summer and started my first full time position shortly after. It’s near my hometown, so I am still living with my parents in order to save up. I have been able to grow with this company a tremendous amount, but I had always planned on moving to a bigger city once I saved up more money and gained more professional experience. I am also in a long distance relationship, and me and my boyfriend decided that I would move to his city soonish.

I have two questions regarding this change:

* In my previous experience applying for jobs/internships out of state, I was always turned down from the applicant pool as I was never local. Does anyone have any advice for applying to jobs in anticipation of a move? I read online to list someone else’s address as your own on your resume, so they will get the impression that you are in the area, but that feels like it would backfire. Would it be better to move and then pursue the job hunt when I’m actually there? I worry it would take a long time to get hired, and I’m not sure how long I can be unemployed once I’m there (with rent, bills, etc.)
* My team is generally short staffed and always hectic, so I imagine that when I leave it will have an impact. I don’t want to leave them under the bus with a two week notice. I was considering giving them a 2 month notice (i.e. let them know soon if I’m moving in June) so they might have time to look for a replacement, and if they are hired in time, I can even train them before I go so it won’t take up another team member’s time to train. Additionally, if I start applying for jobs before I move to the new city, I would like to be able to list my current supervisors and coworkers as potential references and this would be a way I could also let them know ahead of time. However, I lack a lot of professional experience and don’t know if this is highly unorthodox or if it will cause even more contention if my whole team knows for two months before I leave. When/how would it be best to let my boss/coworkers know that I'm planning on moving?

Any insight to these two questions would be highly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading!"

My grad ceremony is this upcoming weekend and according to a friend that graduated two years prior, he tells me that I put your degree emphases in the program. 

My mom has a high temper and although has disciplined me in the past, she has gone overboard to strangle me and choke me.

My dad isn't that much better; basically laughs at people who arts degree not science degrees.

In addition, I have been seeing visions of me hurting myself which would hinder me from attending the ceremony coming up. I don't know if it's because of my anxiety or what. 

I'm not sure if my stupid judgement with my folks is what is making me so anxious and uncomfortable.

My mom has done a lot regarding my grad and believes this is about me but I am not happy about graduating. Why? Because it only solidifies the fact that I have to suppress parts of myself in order to live happily with my mom. My mom wants me to an extension of her (be more feminine, etc.) but I'm just not. I like wearing men's clothing, participating in more male activities, the like.

Anyway, I wanted to say this before shit hits the ceiling. I know I'd like to come clean but I dunno…

I think I care about what people think of me and value myself based on their perceptions of me. "

We sorta lost touch and then randomly she messaged me and we started chatting again. About a week ago we make tenuous plans to meet up. Everything seems to be perfectly normal, there are no signs of anything strange. She says she finished up some work yesterday early and had the night off so I suggested we meet up at the local breweries (there are 5 of them in a row where I live). She says, you know, that its a great idea and I pitch to meet for 8 she says sure just have to walk the dogs. Perfect. I get ready to go, head over to my sisters place where she says she is running a little bit late but that she is on her way now. Sounds good to me. I drop my car off and walk over the breweries on foot a couple of blocks away. At about 8:30 I arrive at the breweries, pick Yellow Dog which is awesome and find us a spot to sit at the very front of the brewery which overlooks the road. Lots of people around but I found a nice spot for us. She says, ""Hey, where are you?"" and I mention - Yellow Dog, second one from the left, I'm at the very front you can't miss me, I got the best seats in the house (found out later that the seats were reserved for people who brought dogs which is why they were still available.. woops). Anyways, she totally stops responding. I'm like okay, whatever - a half hour goes by its 9 oclock, and then another, and then another. It's 10 oclock and she hasn't sent me a message or arrived. I'm like well I guess I got stood up, brush it off as a silly girl and head home no worse for wear, her loss right? I sent her a message saying thanks for wasting my night off, and thats it.

Freakish thing is she hasn't responded to any of the messages, no excuse, no nothing. I sent her a text, no response, instagram message, no response. Prior to all of this there was absolutely nothing wrong, no hint of an issue, she expressed happiness and interest in finally meeting. You would think she would have said something in her defense.. So now I'm kinda worried. Did she go missing? Is she okay? Did something happen to her? Should I just carry on and forget about it - too bad so sad? I can't help but feel obligated to at the very least make sure she is okay. I sent her a message saying, ""If you say nothing else at all, please just let me know you are alive and not abducted or dead, that would be nice.""

What do I do here? Call police and report it non emergency? I only have her first name, date of birth, and I roughly know where she lives. Anyways, I thought I should get some advice. Help me reddit"

He refuses to ash in it and states that ""it's a garage, you should be cleaning it anyways so you can clean the ash up too"".

I don’t want to go too deep into specifics of what’s happening with her but I feel like I don’t know how to talk to her anymore because I can’t find a middle ground. I don’t want to act like this doesn’t exist, and I don’t want to act incredibly sorry for her making it harder for her to let go. 

On one hand I can see how pretending it’s a non issue will make it harder by making her see the way her life used to be before she was sick. Bunny doesn’t want to die and she’s not ready, so I can see how this will make it harder for her to let go. 

On the other hand, I can’t help feeling a little bit sorry for her. What she’s going through is very hard for a 16 year old girl, and I want to be there and show some empathy for her, but I’m afraid of making her feel guilty for being sick because she’s “upsetting her friends”. 

I’m trying to plan a day to go out with her some time over the summer, the doctors gave her a year and a half, but I don’t know how to go about this planned day without making it seem painfully obvious that she isn’t going to make it.

The thing is we're going to an amusement park sometime in the near future with some of our friends. I've got a few questions I'm hoping could be answered

One question is **I don't know how many dates it takes to make us an offical item.** It will be 2 dates but, I have never been on a date till recently. 

""*Anotha one*:"" **I don't know how to exactly 'make a move.'** I'm a pretty socially awkward 17 year old and she's socially awkward too. I hear stuff about people having sex on the 3rd date and it'll be the second one and I haven't even kissed her. (To be honest and as embarrassing as it is to admit this, I don't know how to kiss). 

The final question: **She wants to invite a couple of friends to go with us.** I mean I think it'd be cool to have a group of people to go with us and I'm down with it. My concern is I don't know if she wants to invite people so it doesn't seem as much as a date, or if I'm boring with just me. I think I'm over reading it because I'm too self-conscious and  have anxiety. The other part of this question is how do I go around with being more physically around her with some friends around us. Such as 'making a move.' And in a rare case we somehow magically start getting closer and I make my move correctly, how would I avoid getting too close and ruining the vibe of everything for the other friends with us? 

Sorry for the long message, I'm a self-conscious, kissless virgin lol.

How long till I can say we're 'going out'

At work in retail I am constantly talking to people, helping them, giving complicated advice on products. It wears me to the fucking bone. I'm an introvert too, it's just torture for me to have to talk to people for 8 hours.

I sleep on the floor. My internet has a data cap so I can't watch movies without being charged extreme amounts for it.

I have to find a new place to stay or I'm homeless but even with money I can't find a place. I need a better paying job but I cant get an interview. I honestly don't want to work another day because it wears me out and takes an entire day of my life away.

8096,cmxnoc,AnxiousAlways333,My boyfriend went on a trip and came back a totally different person. I don't know what to do.,"A month ago my boyfriend of 6 years went to a family dinner to celebrate his sister's recent engagement. Because he lives a few hours from them he stayed a few nights. I couldn't go because we're long-distance for the time being but I sent his sister my regards. 

That being said, upon returning he started acting... different. Usually we joke and laugh together quite a bit. We talk about our favorite TV shows/whatever we did throughout the day and both agree we have undeniable chemistry. But the past month my boyfriend has been cold. He doesn't make an effort to keep a conversation going and answers my questions curtly. He's also become much more rigid and serious. If I make a joke he would typically laugh at, he doesn't. Sometimes he won't even pick up on it being a joke. 

I asked him point blank what was wrong and he said nothing. I asked if he was OK and he said yes. I then asked if he was sad, to which he said no. I asked if he was angry, to which he said no. I asked if work was hectic and he replied ""Somewhat, but not any more than usual."" 

I'm confused. It's gotten to the point where I dread him coming home from work because I know there's going to be a tense vibe coupled with long silences. This is exacerbated by the fact that we spend all if not most of our free time together. He calls me daily on his lunch hour and after work.

What should I do? I don't want to hound him if nothing is genuinely wrong, but the change in behavior is concerning. 

TLDR: My boyfriend of 6 years visited his parents recently and came back a different person: a serious, almost angry, humorless version of who he was. I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing."

I have been trying to fix the things she said what she didn't like how she couldn't talk to me and such just trying to make her feel like we could stay together and work things out. Some more texting later and she said (this is where my question comes in) that she's been doing better ,she's being more happy and only cried once yesterday because of family problems, she's talking to friends more and overall doing  a lot better she's also stressing less. What I basically got from that is that she's doing a lot better without me there. I told her how that's what I got and she said that she still has me as her screensaver and she wears the ring I got her still.(I  also told her that she's doing better because she has no reason to think of me) basically what I got from that whole conversation between us is that until she decides how she feels about us I'm just here waiting and trying to work on things further only to either have her break up with me deciding that she is better off without me or we stay together but it's just like this forever.

30938,8bu9e6,nickyno,"Mid 20 something, tired and bored to death. What should I do?","I’m 26 and pretty stumped - particularly with my career. I received a bachelor’s degree for journalism when I was 22. I’ve spent the past two years working at a small newspaper. I do okay. I wouldn’t say I’m a great reporter by any stretch, but the readership has voted me the best in the area two years running. That has a lot to do with me writing mostly soft news. I do cover courts and hard news, but honestly it leaves me feeling sick that I’m putting people on blast. Likewise, I’m a social introvert. I hate seeing my name everywhere, and when I make mistakes on the front page of the paper I feel like I’m really letting people down. The gig itself is just kind of a dead end entry level. I make under $12/hr. I have coworkers who have worked here for 20 years and make no more than a dollar than me per hour. Our office environment is treacherous.

There is comfort with this job though. I live in my hometown. I have a nice low-rent house near my job and my favorite bar, so that’s a lot of fun. And, currently I can do my work efficiently. Plus I really do love my boss.

For 10 years I worked a summer job which pays me around $13/hour, but this year I’m retiring from that. The extra money is nice, but I haven’t had free time in the summer since I was a teenager. This funny thing happens in your mid-late 20s - you realize your family is getting older and spending time with them is important. I want to explore new ventures. I love shoes and usually I’m pretty good at hooking my friends up with Air Jordans or Yeezys. Dog walking seems like a healthy side job too.

What I’m afraid of though is that I’ll settle. I don’t want this to be my life a decade from now. With my 30s staring me down I just want to feel something more gratifying and make some money.

I can attend any public university in Michigan for free. I just honestly don’t know what my life’s passions are. Some of the things I love include cooking rare steaks, smoking meats, cooking in general along with fashion and sneakers. Sports are a huge part of my life, but Monday morning quarterbacking not actually playing them.

Does anyone have any advice? Maybe I’m just depressed because Michigan’s winter just got extended into May. I’m all ears. I’m just really, really sick of where my life is at right now. I’m pretty certain I don’t want to continue working at a newspaper. That part is for sure."

They recently made some transitions in roles and put certain people in place that suck ass at interpersonal skills and are actually causing rifts in the company. So, I am deciding to leave that shitty place. 

The reason I want to give them a piece of my mind is really for the people whom I care about that are going to be left picking up the pieces after I leave. 

Should I say something about all the shitty decisions they've made? Professional language of course. I also want to note that once I leave, a few are sure to follow (they've already told me) and it will be a big ""damn, they were right"" thought in minds of the owners.

or Should I just leave silently like a ninja in the night?"

24796,96a0w6,JigglyJams,I feel like a worthless human being.,"I'm 26 years old, jobless, have no car, no health insurance, am morbidly obese, no college degree, very limited job experience, and have horrible anxiety. 

First of all this anxiety isn't a recent thing I remember having it in my earliest memories. Although, I can't remember much of my childhood till after 10-11ish years old. I've always been shy, anxious and absolute shit in sort of situation that involves interacting with another human being. The one exception to this is my boyfriend who I met almost two years ago on the verge of homelessness after finally moving out from my families home. 

I thought I could do it. Live on my own, go to school, work and finally take control of my life...it didn't go well. My sweet, sweet boyfriend who I'd only been seeing for a few weeks gave me a place to live. Aside from the odd babysitting job I didn't make any money till I got a seasonal job at a movie theater. They didn't decide to keep me and I haven't been able to find another job since they let me go in January. I've filled out so many applications, done so many interviews but no one wants to hire me. 

Yesterday I just got my latest rejection email from White Barn (Bath and Body Works sister store) saying they wanted to go for someone with more relevant experience. That really..really fucked with me and I had my first full blown panic attack in front of my boyfriend. Everything he tried to say to comfort me just made me feel even more terrible.  It was just a simple retail job but I wanted it so bad. It was an hour long group interview with a product demo and for once I thought I got my anxiety under control and did well. The hiring manager even complimented my mini sales pitch and encouraged all of us to go check out the store so we could get an idea of where we'd be working.  So yeah...I thought I'd finally got a job and I could finally contribute in some way other than household duties and errands. That was why I had such a nuclear meltdown. 

This is my job experience:

Apr 2011- Dec 2016 In Home Supportive Services (for my mother who I love but have a somewhat toxic relationship with)

Oct 2013-  Mar 2015 Macys (Lost this job because my mother was very sick and I kept having to take days off last minute)

Oct 2017 - Jan 2018 AMC (This was just a seasonal job at a very small theater)

Since that nothing and my unemployment insurance is almost out. I have about $350 left so about 1.5 payments. I've been contemplated doing IHSS again but my lack of car makes that pretty impossible.  My boyfriend is telling me to go back to school but what will that help if I can't interview without sounding like I'm mentally challenged? I've never done well academically either but a lot of that also had to due with my anxiety. I was the kid who'd seriously throw up in their mouth every time they had to give a small presentation. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't understand how people who don't give a shit about working manage to get jobs.  Mcdonald's won't even hire me and I really can't stop thinking about just dying. I don't want to be rich or well known. I just want to live semi comfortably and have a family of my own one day. 

Sorry this is so long part of it is me just needing a place to vent to people I don't know. "

It's like I don't really develop any feelings for other people.

I  am just feeling lonely all the time and I don't know how to endure it  anymore. I tried many different things. But nothing seems to help :\-\(

Here is a list with some of the things I did:

* I went to the gym
* I joined a sports club
* I went to several sport activities at my university
* I attended several language classes
* I lived in a student dorm for 2 years
* I tried spending time with classmates
* I chatted with a lot of people online
* I went to therapists

I  basically tried to force myself being around people and I kinda hoped  that somehow I would be able to get over my problems and make friends in  the process. But that didn't happen.

And I tried doing nothing as well. People recommend to not force anything. Just live your life and those things will come naturally. That's not true. That doesn't work either.

It is very frustrating and demotivating.

I don't know what to do anymore :\-\("

19987,ayndo1,steveayres35,"Why do some girls overreact when they think a guy acts ""weird or creepy"", but he really isn't?","Does it all depend on what the guy is actually doing? Or does the word ""creepy"" have different meanings for everyone?

This has happened to me several times and I'm beginning to think that it's 50/50: Either the girl is overreacting or I'm doing something wrong? I'll give you an example:

At college parties, (I'm currently a junior), there are times when random girls would accuse me of being weird/creepy when I did nothing wrong at all. I understand that drunkeness affects people in different ways, but it's quite interesting when one girl is hugging everyone at the party, while another girl may be paranoid about everything.

Now, I don't mean to brag, but my drunk memory is actually pretty good. I don't drink until I get sick or blackout, I only drink until I get that ""feeling"", but nothing more or less.

On an extra note, even though I'm 21, I don't go to the bar that often because I want to save money. So, vodka &amp; juice is my go to at parties...

But outside of the college party scene, my guess is that everyone reacts differently and I shouldn't worry about it at all, unless if something serious happens."

I'm a real mess right now because someone I love just disappeared from any of my communication means. We're living in different continents.

It's not the first time she had suicidal thoughts, but we somehow managed to not jump the bridge until now. It's not the first time she disappeared either... And I feel so powerless when she does that because I can't do absolutely anything about it...

I can't say I'm perfectly sane either... I also had suicidal thoughts, and I still have them from time to time, but when I get like that, absolutely no one can change my mind besides myself. For me it was always a battle with myself, and if I'm weak, I lose. But I understand that it's not the same for everyone else, and knowing how to approach a situation can make a big difference.

We were working on getting a better life to deal with all our issues, but in the last month I've had to get through a really bad situation with my family, so I didn't have time to give her. Especially in the last week, we barely talked, and today she said something that implied that she's going to go ahead to do it, then disappeared.

2353,dhf5oa,newonewhodis,My dad found out my mom lost their savings gambling/having an affair... where to go from here,"This is a bit of a doozy... but looking for any help.

Just some background, I’m currently in university and my older brother is done school and with a solid job.

My parents have been married for 25 years and are European immigrants and we can be considered typical middle class salary-wise. Looking back, I can see that my parents never had a really intimate relationship and would sometimes have money problems (mom was always in charge of finances since Dad isn’t fluent in English).

My dad just got a call from the bank last week saying something is going on. We turned out to find my mom has been going to the casino and gambling the past few years and has lost most of their savings. My dad found out the past few months she would go to the casino occasionally and lose a few hundred dollars a month and she promised to him she would stop going. But when he looks at the bank history now, sees this has been going on for longer and she has lost almost all of their savings. Too, over the years huge chunks of their savings have been disappearing at a time.

Financially, I know my parents have never been the most well off and not the best savers. They still have their mortgage to pay off, and have a pretty large house. My mom had job issues the past few years and I know my parents haven’t been doing great financially recently.

From what I can tell this has lead to her being overstressed and started her gambling so much. Too, given my mom from what I can tell hasn’t been fully in the marriage (She doesn’t feel loved/happy the way she should be... refers to herself as suffering by being with my dad) so I understand how it got to this point. More to add, my dad has told me he caught her cheating on him multiple times, with him giving her multiple chances to fix up her act.

With this all in the open now, Im just looking for any advice on what I should do. Right now my parents don’t know if they will stay together or not. My dad has every right to leave but in his mind the marriage and family is all he has known (in his mid-50s now and heavy Catholic). He doesn’t have friends outside of his coworkers so I know it’s gonna be hard for him to go on his own (also I’m in school in another city far away so I can’t exactly be near to support him... I’m a 5 hour drive away). My mom is not sure what to do because she doesn’t know if my dad will ever trust her again even if she stays and tries to fix it. My mom has lots of friends so going on her own I think she’d be fine.

Honestly, this has been a lot and I’m trying to not take sides in this because they’re both my parents and I don’t know if it’s right to take a side. My mom brought up before that she wanted my dad to try more since she wasn’t happy with how he treats her, and over the past couple months they seemed to be doing a lot better since she brought it up with him (ie. going for walks together, mini food-dates, holding hands, too he drinks a lot less which is something she has had problems with).

So right now I’m just looking for any input/advice I can get on the situation. Should they stay together and try to fix it, even if it means they aren’t actually in it to be together but stay together for the sake of being married? Also how can I help them figure out how to stay together if that’s they’re choice. If they do split up, what can I do for my dad since his savings are gone and he is in his mid 50s... too I worry he’ll go into depression being alone since I’m so far away for school and he has no one close other than our family. Honestly if you have any other input about anything else regarding this situation, it is much appreciated."

The thing that hurts the most is my girlfriend leaving. Don't get me wrong, my dad was very important to me. But he was in very bad health for a long time, and we're just happy that he's at peace now. 

My girlfriend made all of these promises in the beginning of the relationship. She stole my heart and I wasn't even looking for love. All of a sudden she says she lost the spark.

12421,c1gumu,TurboHopper,10-year-old Daughter drugged at slumber party,"Yesterday we dropped our daughter off at her friends birthday party sleepover. We picked her up this morning. Everything seemed fine, so we went about our day. Just now, my daughter told my wife that her friend's mother gave my daughter (and some of the other kids; some kids refused) 4 gummy vitamins that the mother claimed would help her sleep. 

My daughter said it was sweet tasting like strawberry flavor. My daughter also just us that after she ate the gummies, she got dizzy and felt like she was going to vomit. She didn't get sick. 

We're pretty upset. I don't think I need to explain why. I have no idea what was given to my daughter. I mean it could really be gummy vitamins. Still, I feel that feeding other people's kiddos vitamins (no matter how sweet and chewy they are) is crossing a line. I also don't think vitamins would upset my daughter's stomach. The nausea thing might be an exaggeration or just in my daughter's head. Either way, it's still troubling.

My wife asked me if I was angry. I'm upset, but I'm trying to make sense of it. Then my wife asked me what we should do. I have no idea. I don't really know how to handle this. We don't know this girl's mother all that well. She goes to the same dentistry as us. This was the first time my daughter went to her friend's house. 

I really don't know what to do. I don't want to make a big deal out of it if there is a simple logical explanation, something like: It was gummy candies the mother dished out to the kids, telling them they'd help them sleep (but really … just candy … hoping the kids will calm down). I don't know. As a parent I feel like I should do something. I just don't know what. Please let me know how I should handle this situation. Thank you."

Things have been going pretty well, except there's been two instances where I feel like I screwed up pretty bad. 


1. Last Sunday I was working in the afternoon, and during that shift a few guys stole 3K worth of stuff while I wasn't paying attention to them.


2. Yesterday I was supposed to be setting up ads around the store, and barely got any of it done because of not really knowing what to do, and getting held up by other things, leaving the guy after me 2 hours to put it up by himself. 

Part of me feels like I'm innocent on grounds of being new, but the other part knows that these aere two instances where I completely neglected to do the job I'm being paid for. In both instances, my coworkers told me that it was fine, and that it happens to them every now and then, but I can tell they're obviously a bit peeved. Now I'm honestly considering quitting, going to a different department, or changing my schedule drastically. So I suppose my request comes in two parts.

7832,cofbjc,Direct_Xonoh,Should I tell my roommate I'm in.love with her?,"I (30M) have known this woman (30F) for three years now, and she's been my roommate on and off for about one and a half years. We first met when we were studying English abroad, we started as classmates, and got along very well. So when she needed to move out of the house she was in, I offered to share my room with her. (It is very common for 2 or more people to share a room in the city we were in. In this case it was just me and her). 

After 7 months we returned to our country ( we are from the same country, but different states) but kept in touch, texting very often. This was in 2017. Early this year her family decided to move to a city close to where I live, and she asked me if I would like share an apartment with her. I already had an apartment so I said yes, and she moved in with me.

It's been a couple months now that I've realized I am pretty much in love with her. I haven't said anything to her yet for two reasons. One: I haven't seen any hint from her that this feeling is mutual  ( though I am completely oblivious to these things ) and two: I don't want to put her in a position where she feels she has to move out of the apartment and back with her parents because of how I feel. I don't want to make her life uncomfortable. However, keeping this to myself  is starting to have an effect on me and I'm also afraid she'll find someone and I'll have lost the opportunity.

Should I just tell her and see what happens or keep it to myself and avoid possibly making a mess out of her life? 

For clarification nothing sexual ever happened between us and that's also not what I am after. I just want to have her in my life and to be bigger part of it.



TL;DR : Fell in love with my roommate but am afraid to tell her because it could shit on her life."
37491,7pixo2,shaiapitou,"Feeling very unhappy with every aspect of my life, but feel like I can't change anything [LONG]","Let me give some quick background into my life of the last 6 months. 

Last June, I finished high school, and my family and I all moved to a smaller city 2 hours away from where I've lived my whole life. We've all talked about moving here for years - we have some family here, the university I'm now attending is here, everything's cheaper than the big city we were in before, etc. 

My brother did not want to move - he's two years younger than me and very fragile. He's also midway through high school and had to leave all his friends. 
My mother is a very high-strung, immature, scary individual. She's narcissistic and oblivious to the cruel ways she treats everyone, and denies the verbal and emotional abuse she's put my brother and I through for years, no matter how much I tell her she should see a therapist. 
My dad doesn't live with us - my parents have been divorced for 8 years now, though my father also lives in this new small city because his girlfriend lives here.

Anyway. We moved here 6 months ago, at the end of July, and have been living with my uncle ever since. My mom doesn't want to buy a house yet because she thinks house prices will go down 'in the new year' (so, hopefully soon). My uncle has always lived alone and is a strange, antisocial man. He hardly associates with anyone and prefers to sit inside for days watching tv by himself. Despite us now having crashed at his place for half a year, my mom mocks him, complains about everything he does and screams at him for not living a 'normal life'. For some reason, he doesn't say anything to stop her. 

I don't want to complain too much about the living situation, because I'm very grateful that my uncle has let us live here so long already. That said, his house is very old and dirty, and I (18, F) have to share a bed with my 50 year old mother. My brother has to sleep in a spare room with his bed beside a refrigerator. Everything in this house is at least 60 years old. It's not ideal. 

Because of the fragility of my brother, the abusiveness and carelessness of my mother, the lack of social aspect with my uncle, distance of my father, and total lack of friends since we've just moved to a new place, I've been feeling pretty damn lonely and stressed all the time. To make matters worse, my mother and uncle are very religious - to the point of being homophobic and mildly racist. I am an LGBT individual so this makes me especially uncomfortable.

I haven't had a job in months, and haven't had a relationship in over a year and a half. I know that my marks are going to be bad as a result of my stress and I fear my parents' reactions when they see them, but I cannot bring myself to focus on my schoolwork. January also marks the 2 year anniversary of me trying to kill myself, which has worsened my depression further. What can I do to lessen my stress and change my situation? "

3646,daoh9p,oliveelf,My [F19] mom passed away. My boyfriend [M24] isn't willing to help me get home and say goodbye. I'm thinking of ending our relationship over this,"Like the title says, I'm 19, my boyfriend is 24. We've been dating since I was 17 and have been living together for maybe 6~ months now. To make a long story short, I moved several states away to be with him when he got a new job offer and had to move states. He didn't want to leave me behind so he made me choose between moving with him and this new job, or we would have to break up. I'm honestly kind of regretting this now..

My mom never had the best of health. She smoked, alot. She drank alot. She was really overweight and when I was 15, she had to have her toes amputated because she didn't take care of her diabetes. I really think my mom had an addiction to food and she just never got help for it. Despite her health problems, my mom was ALWAYS there for me. My dad took off when I was 3 and never looked back. My mom worked her ass off to support me as a single parent. Yeah there were times she messed up but I always knew she had my back if something ever went wrong and I could go to her about absolutely anything if I needed to

I'm still not sure how my mom died. Her roommate was the one who found her and thinks she either had a heart attack or maybe an aneurysm. My mom's roommate told me that they went to bed on Thursday night and every thing was okay and when she woke up, my mom was cold in her bed. I've been such a wreck since I found out yesterday because I wanted to call her and talk to her but I never got the chance to even say one last goodbye or I love you. When my mom's roommate called me and told me my mom had passed, the first thing I did was look into how much it would cost for me to go back home. I don't own a car (everything is within walking distance so there's really no need) and after doing some math, I realized I was short on the cost. I asked my boyfriend if he could help me out with the rest of the cost of the plane ticket, and he told me no. It hurt to hear but my boyfriend has always been a penny pincher and selfish with his money but I understand because it is his money. When i told him it was for my mom's funeral he said he didn't care. There was no point in going to mourn a ""dead fatass"" who he ""never liked"" He t said he just didn't see a point. He then said there was no reason for me to go. I was just wasting my time by going. That it would just be money wasted. He told me ""I practically own you, you're not going unless I fucking say so!""

I ended up over reacting and losing my shit on him and telling him he was a mean asshole for saying such awful comments. I understand its his opinion and he didn't like the fact my mom was so unhealthy, but neithe did I and I didnt think he would say something so mean and hurtful right after I got the news she had passed. I'm really upset, and angry at him, and have told him this, and he just doesn't seem to give a crap. He just said ""Ok"" and started playing video games, completely ignoring me. If he's thought about apologizing, he hasn't shown me any interest in doing so.

I don't think what he can be forgiven. I'm trying really really hard to see it from his point of view but I just can't. Am I wrong for asking him to be a supportive partner and help? Am I over reacting by wanting to end our relationship on this? I don't want to throw two years away down the drain, but I really don't know if I can ever get over this. I want to say goodbye to my mom. I really don't know what to do from here and I'm really frustrated and angry and confused

TL;DR: My mom passed away from her health issues, either a heart attack or aneurysm. Boyfriend refuses to help me with the cost of going home and said really shitty things. I dont think I can forgive him and continue this relationship. I dont think there's any way to salvage this, is there? Advice would be really appreciated"
17520,bceh5d,egress-means-exit,Is it wrong to not give the benefit of the doubt to a sex offender?,"I work at a coffee shop and we have a regular that comes in and always asks if we have a military discount and flashes his military card (I'm sorry I don't know the proper terms) and everytime we always tell him we don't have a discount. He really wants people to know he has served. I say all this because I recently found out he is a registered sex offender for indecently exposing himself to a 6, 7, 8, and 11 year old girls. This happened (I think based on him saying he's served there in passing) while he was in the military in Guam. It's worth mentioning that it was 20 years ago (twice in the early 90s and once in the early 2000s from my understanding *more info below) and supposedly he has a wife. Since learning of this information I've been sharing it with some co-workers and also my mom, I always tell her my work stories. Both my mom and one of my co-workers who has actually known of this for quite some time both are giving him the benefit of the doubt. Saying things like ""you don't know what really happened"" ""sometimes the legal system makes mistakes"" ""what if it was an angry ex girlfriend and those were all her kids and she wanted to get back at him"" but for me when I first found out I was instantly disgusted and started hating him. I couldn't believe someone did that and can just walk around and be proud of themselves and nobody really knows what disgusting things he did. It's also worth mentioning I may be a bit biased because I recently watched the Leaving Neverland documentary and I recently learned one of my family members was sexually abused as a child. So as of late I just feel like there's no excuse for pedophilic actions. Am I being shitty for immediately being disgusted by this man and not giving him the benefit of the doubt? I know that innocent people get served justice they don't deserve but is this one of those cases?

Some more info:
I looked into it as much as I could but as it happened 20 years ago I could only find so much. 
It's unknown whether he exposed himself to all those girls at once or in separate instances.
It's unknown whether or not he was dishonorably discharged from the military. 
He did have to take a new picture and update his information for the sex offender registery in 2017.
*It says the offense/status is 'Registered As A Result Of Out-of-state Conviction' on a local sex offender site (I am on the east coast of the US for reference.)
*On another site (which is the Guam Sex Offender Registry) his offense is listed as 'Second Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct (As a 1st Degree Felony)' and 'Indecent Exposure' both the same conviction date in the early 90s. And another 'Indecent Exposure' this time the conviction date in the early 2000s. All three in Guam.

In total the Guam Sex Offender Registry site says he registered in the early 2000s, was last reported in 2009, and the latest picture date is in 2017. I've done my best to give all the information possible without including an actual screenshot of the website. This is all the info I have. Thanks for reading."

I just spoke with a worker there and she initially offered me a $4k trial on migraine medication, but since I am on the implant I was disqualified. 
She then offered me $800 to participate on a study on ulcerative colitis but what is involved is this: 
1) physical exam either monday or tuesday 
2) a couple of overnight stays from Thursday night -Saturday morning 
3) I have to be cleaned out with an enema and then given a rectal foam 
4) blood draws 

I am sure I can get off work early Tuesday, and I only work about 4 hours on Fridays, so I could use PTO if I wanted. I am honestly just not sure about the enema part, and I am a little wary of this new medication -what if I get sick or have bad side effects? 
It’s 800 bucks, so that would be great but I am wondering if anybody else has participated in a clinical research trail, and if its worth it or not. The lady I spoke with said the enema and medication application is barely noticeable. As much as I REALLY don’t want to deal with an enema, I would like to further research for those with this condition, as I know its difficult.

32329,86fdc4,Mytherymonster,Son made a mistake and ruining our family,"Hi 

I feel stuck in my life at the moment and dont know where to turn or how to help myself and my family.

Going to where it all began (i will try to include as many detail extra which are relevant)

My son is 23 he asked to move home 6 months ago after a fiery relationship went south. At new year he went on a new year bender with pals for 3-4 days. We were woken 1.30am police banging on door looking for him. They literally raided the house(we complained after) searchlights in our kids rooms, 13+19. Turns out our son had been drink driving and then ran away from the police and they thought they saw him going into our house, which he didnt. In total shock of all this he was eventually found 20 mins later and arrested. Long story short he was charged for drink driving and obstructing the course of justice. Afterwards he confessed to taking all the drugs going and that he drinks to forget then needs an extra ‘thing’ at the end to forget. (His father abandoned him when he was 9. Im his step dad and brought him up basically. Love him to bits. We have spoken about his dad lots and he showed no signs of holding in emotion). He isnt a big drinker so only did the drugs when he binged once twice a month max. 

We got him into drug and alcohol help, with councelling and took him to gp. Sorted a good solicotor and stood by him with the promise he would turn his life around. Over the last few months he would be angry upset happy all the emotions but seems to be getting there.

This brings me onto why i post this.

I have so much anger for the hurt he put his mother, myself and his brother and sister and family through. We still have nightmares from the police banging. Knocks at the door loud ones scare us. If he is in a bad mood we have no time for it. Im not coping well with day to day life with him around, he is still living at home we support him emotionally the best we can but he has splintered the family and its a shell of what we used to be. As he moves on were left behind and i cant shift the feeling of anger frustration.

Has anyone been through similar, how did you cope? Does it get easier.

Thanks in advance

19130,b3b064,imakemyproblems,I'm so fed up with my mom and I don't know what to do about it.,"This is kind of a long post. Sorry. I'd just like some advice on how to handle this situation with my mom.  
  
Some context:    
  
Mom: 59 y/o  
Me: 23 y/o  
Sister: 35 y/o  
  
Sister and I live about an hour and a half away from our parents. My sister and my mom talk every day and generally get along decently, with fights every once and a while. I'm very amicable and generally argue with nobody in my family.    
  
-------------------------------------------------------------  
  
My mom, I think, is a good person. She's thoughtful, generous, and caring. She (and my dad, of course) put me and my sister through college, helped us buy our first car, brought us on numerous vacations, and generally provided everything that would help my sister and I succeed. I'm forever grateful for this. I'm not great at expressing my appreciation and neither is my sister. But I do try and thank her for everything she does.  
  
That being said, my mom isn't perfect. She has a drinking problem IMO. Not to the extent that she's day drinking or anything, more that every single night, she drinks. And she's a sloppy drunk.  
  
Where I work, I can't access my phone during the day. However, I can access my email. My family (me, mom, dad, sister+BIL+kids) is going on vacation in a few months. My sister+BIL are paying for themselves, my mom offered to pay for me. I did not plan on this, but I do welcome it, and thanked her multiple times. Yesterday morning, my mom forwarded me some info concerning the trip (flight info and such.) I was at work, so I didn't really look at it. When I got home, I got a few texts later on saying something along the line of:  
  
&gt; Mom: Did you get my email?  
Me: About the trip? Yeah  
Mom: And not a single thank you? Jeez. Whatever.  
  
By the time I had got home, I had already forgotten about it. This was information she had already sent me before, and like I said, I had already thanked her for it before. That's not an excuse, I think, because saying ""thank you"" costs me nothing. And I should've said thank you. I replied something like this:  
  
&gt; Me: I didn't look at it too closely, and to be fair, I've thanked you time and time again for this. But I'm sorry, I was at work when I got the email, and by the time I got home, I had already kind of forgotten about it. But thank you.  
&gt; Her: Your sister and you are so ungrateful. Whatever.  
  
At this point I'm kind of irritated, but I figure maybe she had a rough day or something weird happened with my sister. I asked my sister:  
  
&gt; Me: (attached screenshot of my convo with my mom)  
Me: What'd you do to piss her off?  
Her: She's off the rails...I was home yesterday and used her iPad, logged in to a website and forgot to log out. She called me later on and was hysterical, asking how she can fixes it, how could you do this to me, you need to fix this now, etc etc. I couldn't deal with it then so I hung up. I texted her a screenshot showing her where to log out later on. But she called me back and called me a bitch, ungrateful, etc.   
Me: Wtf? What's wrong with her?  
  
After this, I basically texted my mom back and told her that I really do appreciate what she's doing, I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, etc. She accepted that and I felt that she and I were okay at that point. But she did start saying things about my sister. Saying that she's selfish and that my dad has always said she's selfish. Also that she's mean.   
  
I don't think she was being fair so I said something along the line of ""She may have been selfish at the moment, but I don't think she's a selfish person, and she really is a nice person. But even nice people can be mean sometimes.""  
  
At this point, my mom replies back saying that no, she's mean and selfish, she wouldn't help her with her iPad and she hung up on her. She starts saying that my sister needs to respect and help her parents.  
  
I come back saying that she was wrong to hang up on you, but sometimes people get frustrated. But she did come back and help you, she just needed to calm down for a minute, and she couldn't deal with everything at that moment.  
  
Then my mom starts to rage at me, saying that I always take my sisters side and that my mind is already made up. She says things like my dad, her, and my BIL are all starting to get fed up with my sister.  
  
I'm getting mad at this point. I said something like ""It's not fair to speak for BIL, you should let him speak for himself. You're being unreasonable, you have to realize that other people have feelings too, and that (sisters) intent wasn't to hurt your feelings, she was just upset at the time. Just like you were. You called her names, she said mean things to you, nobody is innocent here. Also, I really think you two need to try harder to get along. If you want to see (niece and nephew) you've got to go through (sister). Maybe you two need to go to a therapist.""  
  
This went on for a bit, me trying to tell her to look at the situation from my sisters POV, but it wasn't working. Eventually, I got fed up and said something like ""I don't really want to talk to you while you're being like this. It's toxic and I don't want this on my mind when I go to sleep. Please don't text me anymore.""  
  
Then she messages back saying that she's hopeless, she'll cut all contact in our lives, she's cancelling the vacation, she's not coming for easter, etc. I had to send a message back and say that she's not hopeless, stop beating yourself up, but at the same time, stop feeling sorry for yourself. I told her that she seeks validation for everything she does and I think she needs help to work on that, that she needs to love herself for who she is and not for what other people think of her.  
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
  
All of that happened yesterday, so I'm still trying to process it myself. I know I messed up and mishandeled the situation. But I got very frustrated. I'm sure she had been drinking during all of this. I think my mom is the type of person who needs affirmation for everything she does, and my sister and I (especially me, I think) are not great at that.  
  
So, reddit, all of that being said, did I mess up? What should I do?

27096,8txj89,Victors72,Controlling Parents/Household at 19,"Hi all,

I am 19 years old and have an overly controlling father (and basically household). I am a full time student at the University of Michigan college of engineering, and I am home for the summer.

My dad seems to be unlike any other on these types of posts. He likes to intimidate  me with the thought of ""working for him"". By this he means helping him finish our basement in our house that he wants to sell. While it doesn't seem like a bad idea at first, his definition of work takes it way further than a normal job. It means having to make him coffee and eggs in the morning, it means motivating him, ""getting him going"". Usually, I am on his watch Every day until 1 or 2 am, and he controls every free minute I have. We BARELY actually ""work"" and it sucks.

I constantly have to turn down friends' offers to hang out, even if im not Actually working because he says ""Youre working for me"". I can never spend time alone in my  room, either. I'm always being called to just be by his side. 

I have said I will get a job and he replies with, ""Youll go work for someone else but  you wont help out your father?"" He is always making plans for me and even when I am away at college he calls and nearly demands that I come home on weekends to help him out.

We live 20 minutes from my university and several times he has spontaneously  showed up to see where Im at and what im doing.

Now they are paying for everything in college and I DID have a full ride at Alabama but my parents convinced me to turn it down because it was ""too far away from home"" (I live in Michigan). I had an opportunity  to become independent  and lost it pretty much... damn me.

But I have no problem  working or getting a job, but I do have a problem being controlled and manipulated. And thats all my dads definition of work is: control. I've been controlled heavily all through high school, and Ive had enough of it since ive started college. 

When I was away for the fall and winter semesters, my mom used to say that my dad would almost break down at the fact that I was gone and he would be lazy all day, not do anything and sometimes not even eat.

I guess I need some advice because I have literally zero self esteem and I know I have a bright future but my parents are preventing  me from exploring  it. I am studying to be an electrical  engineer, not a builder like my dad. And I think im old enough that I should be exploring jobs that will help my career. What do I do and what  do you think my dad craves so much by making me ""work for him""?

Thanks for any tips and help."

Also how I can’t even cross the street. I was completely scared to cross the street by myself. I always have to hold my parents’ hand while walking. My Dad then asked me where I was going. Then I told him that I don’t know where to go. He then blamed it on my face buried in my phone. Also how my Dad has to walk with me to school,when he didn’t had a car. Even though we literally live near the school. Also I sorta lack social skills. In school I’m just anxious and shy around people. My parents don’t even trust me staying home by myself.

33100,842jlo,SmaxTheKnife,Terrible mindset,"Hi everyone. My name's Max, I'm 16 years old and I'm a junior in highscool. I'm semi-new to reddit and have felt really welcomed by the subs I do post on, so I figured doing something a little more serious couldn't do any harm. 

So, a bit of backstory. For a long time I was heavy; really heavy. At the end of Freshman year I finally decided to do something about it and went out to my dads for the summer, to workout and try to lose weight. I was 6'3.5 265 lbs (It could've been closer to 260, might've been 270, I just go with the middle area, close enough) It was a great experience for me, it gave me a lot of ambition, it made taught me to work at things and how to set a habit. Long story short; there was a ton of friend drama over the summer as well and I ended up transferring to an online school, which I'm still in. At the end of the summer, when I was ready to return to my moms and start doing school online, I was down 25 pounds. Not bad for two and a half months. 

Currently, I'm 6'5 220, my gut is tiny as of now, my arms are getting bigger, my jawline is becoming more defined.. etc.  I go to OTF (Orange Theory Fitness) just about every morning. It's incredibly fun and I enjoy it, but I'm still not where I want to be with my weightloss, but I'm getting there, slowly but surely. Other than that life is amazing. I have great grades, a small group of friends that I trust and appreciate, my moral is high, I'm losing weight, I'm going to film school year the year after my senior year,  but I'm in a terrible mindset. I feel like I need more.. and I know I shouldn't (For all you prequelmemers out there, but seriously, it's true) I feel like I'm not where I *could've been* You know? I sometimes find myself up late (Like right now) sweating, tossing and turning and almost panicking about what I could've been by now if I had taken it more seriously, (It's been a bumpy road for the past few years) and I need to know; what should I do? How can I get into a more positive mindset about life in general. 

Thanks. :-)"

But I think this is unfair because it's not based on her real experience but on others. How can I persuade her to try it? What can I do?

This is the email I've sent to Olive Garden:

Hello Olive Garden,

While I do enjoy your chain-restaurant establishment, my friend does not. In fact, she is prejudiced against your food. The only information she bases this off is from her parents who say they have tried ""The Olive Garden"" at the Fair Lakes Shopping Center location in (city, state) TWICE and had told her the food and experience was awful. 

This is upsetting to me because I think my friend would genuinely not mind eating at your establishment if her parents opinions didn't have so much impact on hers. 

Olive Garden, I need your help to stop the prejudice. Help me find a way to enlighten my friend.

Sincerely,

[my name]

I don't personally know what's wrong with how I walk, but that's the feedback I get. Apparently it took me a really long time to walk, when I was a baby/toddler... so I guess something is off there.
 
 
 
I don't really care. I've had people mention it on and off, but I've tried not to be too self conscious about it. I wear heels a lot now, which I thought kind of corrected/masked the issue? Well, apparently not. 
 
 
 
Earlier in the week, a coworker (who doesn't like me) told me I have a ""cute, unique"" walk. This was a way of veiling an insult. I just laughed and kept going. 
 
 
 
Today, I'm walking behind another coworker, and they say ""I know that was you, you've got that weird wal--- I mean I recognize people's walks. I'm good at that"" 
 
 
 
I know how this place works. I'm the running joke right now. People are making fun of how I walk for the millionth time in my life. The funny part is that I'm the a manger where I work - all of these people report to me. You'd think there would be some respect/politeness due to that, but there's not.

We never text or go out and ever since he started studying in the same uni as me, he has never EVER invited me to study together, with his friends, even after I requested if he could invite me.

28396,8mk68f,travelvacate333,I'm doing a research paper on fake diplomas and need advice.,"## 

I have a friend who supplied me with this info \- when I mentioned the high probability of being caught.......

False.  You can get a fake degree from a legit looking online school. They are  not an actual school \(no classes\). If you pay them a certain amount of  money they will mail you a fake diploma and transcripts. The school  websites looks like a real college. They have a navigation saying  ""Financial Aid Help"" ""College Info"" ""Faculty"" ""Students"". Pictures and  looks completely legit.

As far as your  employer calling the school \- well no big deal! They will call the  school and ask for your information. The person on the phone will say  ""Yes James Lee did attend her from 2006\-2010 and graduated with a BA in  Business"".

From my understanding some of  these online schools also have a database they put your name into. So  when employers or hr managers try other ways of getting your info you  will be legit in the different databases they check.

Of  course these online fake universities may not be accredited by the  correct bodies \- but nonetheless doing this is way better then just  going to the fake diploma websites that make a diploma for you based on a  real university like university of southern California. They make the  logo different then the real school so it's not fraud \- but they often  don't have a database.

So.........my  problem is that I can't find these sites. I have found sites that offer  fake diplomas. But they use a real university , change the logo  slightly. The problem is that when your employer contacts \(for example:  University of South Carolina\) they will have no record of you. I have  found many of these sites but have not been able to find fake diploma  mills that advertise as an actual university.

In my paper I need to include examples of both types of fake diploma businesses.

I couldn’t pin point the feeling at all, but I knew they were about her. so, I get back from Florida and that night we’re talking. she asks me if I like anyone, and I tell her that I’m not sure. she asks why not,  and I told her that I can’t pin point the feeling and also that I’m sure the feeling wouldn’t be mutual. she said “ well you never knowww” and by this point it’s painfully obvious that it’s her I’m talking about. but I keep insisting that I don’t know what the feeling is. she keeps pushing and I just go for it, she shoots it down (obviously) so I just admit it was a mistake and she instinctively says it wasn’t, even after the next day. recently, I’ve just been getting left on read and she’s found another guy, I try to help her with anything regardless of how I feel, so I wish her well on that. but a couple days ago she shared on her snapchat story that a couple people are annoying the shit out of her, and also said for those people not to push conversations because she’ll just leave them on read. so I kinda had a feeling it was me. today, I ask her if it was me. she responded with another question. why? and I told her that I was just wondering and if it was me she could say, she then said that she’s not good at being straight forward. and now she’s not opening my texts. what’d I do wrong? do all my friends feel the same???"

I was a bit frustrated, but I understand given the situation. 

Well last night I came in for my shift which was only supposed to be a 5 hr mid shift, only to find out the girl that was supposed to come in and help me and also close was the girl that was fired. My boss neglected to tell me that no one else was closing and that I would be alone all night on an incredibly busy Sunday night (there’s a big event going on in my town so it was gonna get hectic) 

I guess he just expected me to come in and find out that we had no one else and then roll over like a good puppy and stay for him without any warning?? I had already made plans for after work and was really frustrated.  Not to mention there was a whole other issue being that our delivery truck never came and the whole store was basically out of at least half its menu. 

Not to mention that our boss WASNT even there for this amazingly hectic day and that he has been on a camping trip for that last few days, instead of interviewing some desperately needed servers. I get it, we all need vacations. But there is a hell of a lot going on and it was just some real shit timing. 

So I texted him after all this and basically said. “I don’t mind helping out but I would really appreciate some notice if I’m going to have to stay way later than I was supposed to, I had plans for tonight that I now have to short notice” and then very sincerely (not sarcastically) told him to enjoy the rest of his vacation and sorry for bothering him. 

I guess that pissed him off and he complained to other coworkers that I was sassing him. 

We did end up closing a bit early in the dining area because of how much food we were out of, and also that our ice machine broke and we were out. But I still had to stay way later then planned and cancel all my after work plans. 

So I guess am I wrong for being upset? Is what I said sassy? I had never before in the year I worked there ever went to him with any sort of frustration or complaint. So I’m just upset that the one time I go to him with an issue I’m shitted on behind my back. I was very civil and I think reasonable."

17829,batohn,OhMyEnglishTeaBags,Quitting my job without giving notice.,"Hi. I'm sure Reddit isn't the best place to get opinions on this but here we go.

Recently (26th March) I was diagnosed with Glandular Fever (for those who don't know, makes you extremely tired, very achey and can give headaches, etc). I had last week off work and this week I also have a Dr's sick note. However, I reallllyyyyyyy hate my job. I'm an apprentice and have been at this IT Company since Nov 26th and I hate it, honestly.  I'm 'required' in my contract to give 4 weeks notice of quitting (!!!) although I do have this 1 week off. Anyway, I assume I wouldn't get my holiday or sick pay if I quit without notice? The sick pay and holiday pay is roughly £540 and then working the 3 weeks is £864. Would you guys work the 3 weeks and get the roughly £1400 or would you just quit? I hate my boss and he makes me do things which I didn't agree to in the contract. I'm also not learning very much for an apprentice. Anyway, opinions pleaseee :)"

We've tried to help him get and keep jobs but he does not want to work. He sits on the couch all day every day trying to file claims against anyone and everyone including the companies we have to help him get in with since he's been in and out of prison for half of his life. Hes been very aggressive toward me and his own mother of whom has handed him upwards of 3000$ in an attempt to help him find his way out of our house. We want to have him escorted out but the issue is that I smoke weed in my car and he's gone out of his way to dig through my things and confiscate, two pipes, a grinder, and one gram. We just want to live in a peaceful place, he's always screaming, insulting, and tearing our things up playing the handy man, and the reason we haven't had him thrown out is because he has plans to use the weed against us. I personally don't mind paying a fine or spending one night in jail if it means he's gone but I'm asking for any opinions or advice anyone might have. thank you!


I might add that Kelly has always had it out for me because he dated my mom, she cheated and left and had me, and Kelly's mom adopted me. I've been as civil as I possibly can be with him. And we can't really afford to get an attorney as local police advised. Wondering what the worst case scenario is here, because I just want to be comfortable in the house I pay to live in."
37789,7omj41,sadnessinmylefthand,Getting over an ex when you are dealing with depression?,"I have been trying to get over a girl I dated a year ago, she was my first and only girlfriend, and the only girl to show me any interest. I am a short, super skinny, pale dude who naturally looks like a undead skeleton, I'm repulsive to 99.99% of the female population, and I know that. I've tried to improve myself, but I can't change bone structure or height, and weight is very hard for me to gain, its a lot of work to gain just ten pounds only to lose it doing nothing during a depressive episode. 

During one of my episodes I got in contact again, and it was like a cloak of sadness being lifted. Just being in the same room with her made me happy, feeling her arms around me made me feel like I'm not some disgusting subhuman, because someone actually likes me. We were both depressed, and it was so nice to make someone else feel the same way I was feeling. Its pathetic I know, especially on top of her fucking me over once already and I know its over, done, there's no going back, but still, the want for acceptance is massive. Especially when from what I've seen and read, people like me rarely ever find anyone who is actually attracted to them. We just get used and treated like garbage or ignored completely. 

How do you forget about a girl when you are depressed and extremely insecure? How can I achieve the same feeling she gives me, but with something else? "

7592,cpnsdl,sammers916,A Questionable Friendship (LONG),"Okay so I’m currently 20 years old and have been friends with this girl since I was 15. She and I were SO close in high school, there wasn’t a weekend we didn’t spend together. My junior year she had me join this group of volleyball friends she had, and I started liking this guy. She was super shady about it from the beginning, like texting him constantly. Well long story short I got denied by him, and the next morning she tells me that she kissed him and planned on dating him. I was destroyed. Another situation was she refused to drive me home and made me walk because “it was only 5 minutes”. Like she legitimately just didn’t want to do it so she made me walk home. She also refused to talk to me for a week because I confided in a mutual friend about my feelings towards her and wanted advice, and that friend told her and that made her upset. There were so many more minor occurrences during high school but I ALWAYS forgave her, I stood up for her when people told me she was shitty and I always made decisions based on what she’d think about it. Well then in January of 2018, I was raped. I told her the night after it happened. She was the ONLY one who I told about it, and I made her swear not to tell anyone until I was ready. The next day her mom calls mine and tells her about it. I didn’t get my own time to prepare or get myself together or anything. She took that from me, but that’s not it. She reassured me a million times that I could tell my other friends on my own time. I had 2 main friend groups, but I told my college friend group first due to the fact that I could be face to face with them at that time, and then I told me high school friend group. Summer of 2018, my high school group (there were 4 of us) had ignored me and “she” (referring to whom this post is about obviously) was the one who caused it. She purposefully talked about me and anything she could to make my other two friends not want to be around me. Well I finally tell my friends like months after, I waited until they were home from college. They at first were very supportive, but a few days later I’m out with my boyfriend to eat and I get a message from them about how unfair and disrespectful it was for me to tell my college friends first. And She was the one who had told them that I told them last. But again it was so that I could tell them face to face. I was destroyed, heartbroken, and alone. I had never felt so awful. That is the exact reason why victims don’t tell anyone. How do you even justify that? Fast forward to now. Me and her had taken a break of being friends, and that break lasted 3 months. And in those 3 months I grew up and realized with her not being in my life, I was able to be myself again. I had less anxiety attacks, my depression improved. I genuinely bettered myself. We’re friends again and it at first started off great and we were back to us again. Now I’m feeling the same sort of bullshit from her, but I’m not upset or anxious about it, I truly don’t give a damn about her. I have moved on from that toxic friendship. But is that wrong? Am I being too focused on the past? I’m worried that I’m taking things to loosely and becoming anti social or i don’t even know the word for it. I just need advice, any or everything. Sorry this was long I kind of ranted. Thanks for reading if you made it here."

A month after I moved in he moved in his girlfriend he had been seeing for a month or so. He asked me if this was okay and it was and has been.

35593,7w16k6,Mewsicat,How do we get a friend of a friend out of our room?,"Sorry, this is going to be a pretty long post. I currently live in a triple room in college. One of my roommates (let's call her Yvonne) has a friend (Sam) who is disliked by everyone else in our friend group (including my other roommate, Jody). He seems to really like Yvonne, even though she has a boyfriend. 

Sam lives in a different dorm. Pretty much every night, he comes over to our dorm, eats dinner with us, and then after that he comes up to our room and parks himself right next to Yvonne at her desk. He doesn't leave until he feels like it, or when Yvonne wants to sleep (but not when Jody or I want to sleep).

Now, Jody and I wouldn't really mind this, except Sam is genuinely a horrible person. I'm not really sure how else to phrase it. He is very violent (anger issues, likes to talk about gore/death/his dead father). He doesn't care at all that none of us like violence, and continues to stubbornly talk about it a lot. This makes us pretty uncomfortable, and he knows it. 

Continuing on the violence tangent, he likes pointing out that he always carries a knife with him, and likes talking about how to kill/injure people (""This is where you want to press if you want to gouge someone's eyeballs out"" -Sam) He also really likes play-fighting with Yvonne, even though (1) she has a boyfriend, and (2) if you actually try fighting back, his anger issues flare up, and he becomes really aggressive. Obviously, this scares Jody and me since we don't want Yvonne to get hurt.

At this point, Sam is only friends with Yvonne (pretty sure he's picked up on the fact that the rest of us don't like him). Even Yvonne seems to keep him at a distance, but he doesn't seem to get the message. We think he likes her because on multiple occasions, he's been very insistent that she go with him on outings (like frat parties or drinking events, stuff that Yvonne isn't really into). 

Once, when Yvonne's boyfriend was visiting, they were going on a date to the mall, and Sam intentionally third-wheeled even after the rest of us in the friend group clearly got the hint that they wanted time alone.

Most recently, once Yvonne went to sleep, Sam stayed in our room and pulled his chair up next to her bed and watched her sleep until Jody turned off the lights and he finally left. 

How do we get him out of our room (and hopefully out of our lives)? To him, Jody and I are like air. He couldn't care less if we were going to sleep or even taking a shower or if we wanted to study quietly. He hasn't done anything worth reporting to authorities, but we are concerned for Yvonne since Sam's creepiness level has increased drastically since the new semester started. 

PS- Yvonne is also a really accepting and nice person, and Jody and I don't think that she wants to/could cut off relations with him. 

PPS- Somewhat unrelated, but Sam is also nasty. Like, doesn't shower nasty. His hair gets really greasy and he doesn't look like he takes care of himself (another reason why we don't like him)."
26125,8z73ja,Scriptdwarf,A person is talking to me 24/7 for days now. I don’t know what that means.,"I met a person through a discord server that has been talking with me for 6 - 7 hours straight each day for days now.  There is a 5 year age gap. I would post puzzles that i came up with and would encourage others to solve them for a reward. This person didn’t manage to solve a single puzzle but yet struck up constant conversation. 

I feel like it should be less. It’s not like i don’t enjoy it i am just shocked by how much it is. I usually don’t talk to people through chat ( i don’t talk to anyone to be honest) so this feels a bit strange. I am not sure if i should continue chatting this much. I am afraid if i tell the person to talk less it would scare them off. That is  not something i want. 

If i don’t respond for an hour i don’t get spam with question marks or any other pushy behavior to get me to talk. Its just that if i reply the person would be engaged the whole time replying instantly. Like we would be talking face to face having constant focus.

The age of this person is so young i am not sure what that means.

Subjects are league of legends, this persons culture, my culture, life stories (heavy stories), music videos, dumb memes and random subjects in between (not serious ones). I would try to help this person understand how to solve my puzzles but that doesn’t work out well. This person lives in a country which you are not free to talk whereas i live in the most free country of the world. 

What should i do. Continue talking or is there a way to make me feel less uncomfortable. The age gap makes it feel like strange. I’m a solid 4/10 and this person is 8/10 or higher. It’s stupid but i would like to see some improvement in feeling better."
36500,7stcos,-life_starts_now-,"How do I rebuild my broken and stunted life? (really long post, sorry)","#How do I rebuild my broken and stunted life?


TL;DR:

I'm a 28 year old man. I have no job, no friends, no family.  I weigh 550 pounds. I am on SSI disability for anxiety and PTSD and my weight. I have been homeless on and off since I was 16 years old.  I am on a waiting list for public housing. I'll be in an apartment in a month or two.


**How do I build a life?**

This is going to be long, sorry about that. And sorry for any spelling errors. It was very emotional for me to put all of this into words.


I was raised by two horrible and sick people.  My mother  is a narcassist and paranoid schizophrenic. I have had no contact with my mother in 10 years. My father is a pedophile, rapist and has borderline personality disorder.  I have had no contact with my father in 2 years. 

When I was young, my parents kept my sister and I completely isolated from people and culture. I have never played with a child my own age. I never learned to play or socialize with anyone.  She would read the bible to me and my sister for hours a day. We  were technically homeschooled, but never learned anything except the bible.  When my parents would leave, they would lock us inside the house, and tell us that if we left, people would kill us or abduct us or corrupt us.  

We had a small TV in the house, but no TV antenna. It was only for playing  certain videos that my parents approved. We could only watch church material and a few old movies. When my parents would leave the house, my mom would take the TV with her and lock it in her van, so we couldn't watch anything without their supervision. 

My mother also would regularly starve us. My mom was obsessed with health. She always thought she had cancer or something.

 She would feed me a tiny bowl of plain oatmeal for breakfast and a few leaves of lettuce and a small chunk of tuna(maybe the size of a quarter) for lunch.  When both parents were home, they'd almost always fight, and they'd each end up in different rooms, and my mom would be crying and my dad would be sleeping. My mom would say dinner was ""fend for yourself"".  We rarely had family dinners. I don't even remember them.  My sister usually make food for me and her. She'd make me ramen noodles or spaghetti or mac and cheese or whatever for dinner.   
My dad would over feed me when he could. On weekends he would take me to the McDonalds drive through and buy 12 cheeseburgers and let me binge. This was the only ""real"" food that I'd get for the week. My mom would never allow me to eat fast food.  My parents would eat their own food, but feed us crap. We weren't allowed to have the ""adult food"". (By the way, I thought this was normal until a few years ago).

It was pretty common for my sister and I to go to sleep hungry, and then with my acutely developed sense of smell, wake up and unbeknownst to them, sit at the top of the stairs, watching them eat pizza  and take out chinese food and other ""adult"" food.

When I was 10 years old, my dad left my mom, and took my sister and I to live with his mother on the other side of the country. To my sister and I, he was rescuing us. We loved him for this. We hated my mom.

At 10 years old, I was a horribly weird child. This was in the year 2000. I had never heard any music with lyrics before in my life. My mom would only let me listen to classical music because she was worried that the lyrics in music would corrupt me. 

I had my dad buy me a CD to listen to music for the first time. It was Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory. I was blown away. I didn't even know people could make those sounds with their voices. 

This is where my life opened up incredibly. Everything was amazing. My world got HUGE overnight.  TV, Music, culture, THE INTERNET! My dad bought my sister and I computers. I spent most of my teen years on my computer. It was amazing to me.

After moving across the country, my dad divorced my mom and got full custody of my sister and I. He enrolled us in school, and I went into 5th grade, and my sister in 7th. 

It was terrifying. I didn't even know how to talk to anyone. I had never met anyone my own age before. I didn't know half the words they were using. Everything almost sounded like a foreign language to me.  This lead to me being really awkward and getting bullied a lot.  I ended up dropping out of school when I was 13 and my sister did the same when she was 15.
My dad told the school that he was going to homeschool us. He never did.  We never did any homeschooling. I never graduated high school. 
Around this time, my dad started feeding me. And feeding me, and feeding me. I never had a mom to starve me. My dad had no idea how to cook. Every day was like this. Breakfast: 4 sausage mcmuffins, Lunch at the all you can eat Chinese Buffet, and dinner was a bucket of Fried Chicken. This lead to me ballooning to over 400 pounds by the time I was 14.

Around 2004, my dad leaves his PDA(kinda like a smartphone, minus the phone) in his car while I'm waiting for him. I decide to play a game on it. While I'm looking through it... I find pictures... of my sister. Naked. And pictures of various female family members(my grandma, my aunt), their heads photoshopped on to pictures of naked women, and lots of child porn.  I am confused. I have no idea what to make of this. I'm  14 years old. I quickly put the PDA away and pretend I never saw it. Over the years I'd realize the way my dad treated my sister, and it made me sick inside. I was worried he was molesting her. Apparently I learned last year from her, that he tried to teach her how to masturbate when she was 14. And I mean ""teach"" her.... physically...

---- 
My dad was kind of a scam artist(I did not know this  at the time). He didn't have a job. What he did was go to desperate people who wanted to get out of their mortgages, and ""buy"" their houses, and then rent them out. Turns out he didn't really buy them, he got them to sign a quit claim deed to him, and they still kept the mortgage in their names, and he would rent the houses for a price over the mortgage. The owners kept the mortgages in their name, but my dad paid the mortgages with rent money from renters. He'd then ""rent to own"" those houses to people that would put $5000 down to buy these houses from him. 

He did this for a few years until he had 20+ houses. In late 2006, he decided he didn't want to be in this job anymore. He took all the rent money for October 2006 and didn't pay the mortgages, causing all of the old people he got the houses from to default on their mortgages.

Conveniently, my dad decided that we would drive acrossed the country to go on a long water fast together to lose weight.  So he drove us out to the Arizona desert in 2006 in a big box moving truck, and we both sat out there reading books for 40 days straight without eating, and only drinking water. (Now that I think back to this, I think this was child abuse, but I thought it was good at the time because I lost 100 pounds).


While we were out in the desert, all of his houses were being repossessed, including our own house.  When we got back we had no where to live. My sister was 18 at this time, and luckily for her, she had moved in with her boyfriend. I was stuck with my dad.  


Over the next 4 years we would be mostly homeless. Sometimes  squatting in abandonded houses, and during winter times(this was in Michigan), my dad put on a suit and tie and  would rent an office in a run down office building for the winter to keep us out of the cold. We'd sleep in offices while he cooked up another business plan that would eventually fail. Oh yeah, and I gained back the 100 pounds that I lost during this time, plus another 100 pounds for good measure.  In the summer of 2007, my dad convinced his mother to give control of her business, a well established local pet store, over to him.  We'd live in the back of the store. My dad did a lot of ""renovating"" of the store, but in reality was inflating the costs of the renovation and taking out loanss and skimming cash off the top.  By October 2008, this store of 40 years was out of business and all the employees were out of a job, and we were homeless again.  

So what did my dad do? Did he get a job? Nope.
 He put on a suit and tie, went to another run down office building, and rented out an office for $350 bucks a month for some new bullshit business for the next year. I went with him, because I had no where else to go. 
In the middle of winter 2009, his office building was set to be demolished so it could be turned into a parking lot for the new YMCA, so we were once again homeless. My sister begged her boyfriend to let us move in with him. He hated my father. But he eventually let us move in, but only for a few months. 

My dad ended up concocting a new plan while we were there. He decided that we should both go to college together and becoming nurses.. I was now 20 years old. He's in his 50s. At this point,  I  only have 2 years of elementary school under my belt.

He decides to make up some fake  trans scripts and a diploma for me, and has me apply for college out in Arizona, and of course apply for loans and grants.  
The community college there is incredibly cheap, and we'd end up getting a few thousand dollars in refunds back from loans and grants each semester, so it would pay for us to live and survive. He also faked some records so I could get in state tuition.

So we move out to Arizona, and now I'm in community college, totally unprepared, and every semester, further indebting myself for another one of my dad's schemes.  We do this for 3 years and I fake my way through college, really going nowhere. My dad encourages me to just take a bunch of classes to figure out what I want to do with my life, as long as I stay in full time so I can keep getting money to pay him for rent. My dad also has not taught me how to drive. Now I realize that he did this to keep me dependant on him. 

While this is happening, my sister loses her job and has a mental breakdown, tries to kill herself, and is hospitalized for awhile. She ends up getting on disability for her mental illnesses and is still on disability today.
 She is worried about me, and comes out to visit me in Arizona. She eventually helps me by buying me a car. I take the car, and teach myself to drive, against my dad's wishes (at this point, I'm 23, she's 25). Within a month of having my drivers license, my sister convinces me to move back in with her and leave my dad in Arizona. Now I see my dad cry for the first time ever. He's begging me not to abandon him. I almost decided to stay, but my sister begged me to move back to Michigan with her. So we did. 

Immediately after we left, my dad stops paying the bills(which are all in my name by the way, I did not know this, and this ends up ruining my credit). And he moves into his car.  

Within a month of living with my sister in Indiana, I have a job. Another month and I make some friends at work, and a month later I move in with 3 of them and we all share a house. This is by far, the best part of my life. I smoked weed for the first time with my new friends, and it was transcendent. I was having a great time. I'm working full time, 40-50 hours a week (just at walmart, but I actually loved my job). Every few days, I get emails from my dad, telling me how miserable he is living in his car, and how dangerous it is for him to live there. 

After 8 months of this, life is going great for me. And my dad shows up at my house in Michigan. He gives me a sob story and convinces me to let him live with me, in my bedroom.  He mentions that he wants to kill himself all the time. I reluctantly let him move in with me, but tell him he can only stay for a month, and he needs to go to the homeless shelter. 

Over the next month, he hates that I'm working full time. Its the holidays and I'm really busy at work. He resents that I'm working and I'm self sufficient. He sleeps all day while I'm at work and stays up all night in my bedroom on the internet watching movies and videos while I'm trying to sleep. My performance at work starts suffering... 


I end up getting injured and losing my job at walmart. I was clumsy because I was sleep deprived.  My dad seemed happy that I lost my job... I ended up telling him to leave. I can't handle it anymore. He moves out into the homeless shelter. He's furious at me. 

I decide to go back to college. I finally found a career that I think I want. I want to be a paramedic.  I go down to the local community college and sign up. I take out loans and grants to support myself.  A few weeks later I show up for my first class. 

Guess who's sitting in the front row? 

Yep. My dad. He wants to be a paramedic now too. 

This was a miserable semester. It was so fucking embarrasing to be in the class with my dad. I end up passing the EMT portion of the class, the first semester, and I drop out of the paramedic training. I just don't want to be around my dad.  

Around summer of 2014, my dad asks me for help cleaning out his storage room. I reluctantly oblige and help him.  I noticed something in the corner of the storage room. Its a locked aluminum box. I've  seen it before many times, and always wondered what was in it.   While he's doing something in his van, I check out the box, Its actually unlocked, so I open it. Inside.... is hundreds of  pictures, a few hard drives, KY jelly, tissues, and... my sister's underwear.  I slam it closed, and walk out of the storage room and take off. I left my dad without any explaination. Later that night I felt a horrible pain in my chest. I think I'm dying. I can't breathe. I can barely move. It feels like someone is sitting on my chest. There is crushing pain in the center of my chest and radiating up my face and down my arms. I'm sweating, I'm numb, and cold.  I stumble outside and call 911.  I tell them I'm dying. I'm having a heart attack. I'm only 24 years old.

After being in the hospital for 2 days, and undergoing cardiac stress tests and ultrasounds and everything, they diagnose me with panic disorder. It was just a panic attack. That's what a panic attack is? I had no idea. This felt real. It couldn't just be in my head, could it?  

Over the course of the next few months, I have these same events 3-4 times per day. I feel like I am absolutely, 100% dying, multiple times per day. My dad is now an EMT with the local ambulance service. If I call 911 again, he might be the one showing up  at my door.

It takes a few months, but I eventually break down and tell my sister what happened. I tell her what I found 10 years ago, and what I found 10 years later in his storage room. My psyche was not letting me hide this anymore. My sister felt terrible for me, and told me that she knew something was wrong with my dad. She told me he tried to teach her how to masturbate when she was 14, and tried to get her naked multiple times.

She decided to confront him. I couldn't bare to look him in the face. I was a coward. I couldn't look at him. I left her to confront this predator alone. 

She tells me that he told her that he admitted it. He said that he likes incest. He told me he'd get counselling for it.  My sister and I decided to cut off contact with him. This was in 2015, and I haven't talked to him since. He's emailed me a few times and told me he got concelling for it and is better now. He told me the consellor said that being attracted to his daughter was normal, and was understandable because the pain he went through with the divorce (???? bullshit).

Anyways, after all of this, it basically destroyed me. I couldn't work. I was having panic attacks every day. My sister convinced me to apply for disability. I did, but it would take 2 years for me to get it.

We both had no where to go. We felt unsafe sharing the town with my dad.  We decided to move to the woods in the middle of the country. We found a place that sold empty property with no money down, and we got 5 acres out in the middle of the woods. My sister and I lived there for 2 years while we waited for me to get disability. I needed it. I was agoraphobic(still kinda am), and I needed to heal and be away from people. 

Once I got disability, my sister wanted to move back to live with one of her friends in Indiana. I applied for public housing in the local town closest to me in Missouri. I was approved and have an apartment waiting for me.

For the first time, at 28 years old, I'll be living by myself. Rent and utilities is 30% of my disability check.  After rent, I'll have $500 to spend per month. After other bills(phone/car insurance), I'll have $400 per month.

I also will be getting a check for $13,750 in back pay in September of 2018.

So here is my situation: I'm in the middle of the country, alone, no job, no friends, no family, no high school diploma, 550 pounds, and on disability. 

I do not want to stay on disability forever, but I'm not sure where to start building a life. I am very alone, and I've never been completely alone before. I'm scared, and could use advice.

Thanks, and sorry for the long post and if it was rambling and confusing."

basically what happened was at school, i have a pencil case with cheap pens. they only have 2 parts, the shell and the actual ink part and tip. they can easily be taken apart and put back together in like 3 seconds. i must have forgotten to put it back in so all that was left was the empty shell. my parents had a tantrum like little children and then used childish tactics like violence to show that they are upset with a pen that came from a $1 store pact of 15. the reason why i didn't give them an answer was because i didnt want to waste my time with pieces of shit like them so i would just ignore them and let them waste their time over some random stuff. this isn't the first time i have been assaulted by them though. my father almost got arrested for hitting me and cps even came over"
4582,d65xzr,username447m,Help,I’m not really sure what’s wrong with me but My mom recently got diagnosed with sever depression and she thinks I have it too. The littlest things make me feel overwhelmed with guilt and it’s consuming me I want to get to the doctor ASAP but my mom is a proctor and she can’t just take a day off this is really really getting to me and idk what to do Little things like eating unhealthy or for staying up late overwhelms me with guilt
29094,8j1go0,sharkybucket,Found out my lesbian best friend has a thing for me...how to handle it?,"For starters, I’m straight. We are in high school, I’ve known she was gay for like two years and I’m pretty chill about it. We are both girls. So today I found out from a mutual friend that she likes me, and apparently isn’t worried about sharing it with other people.

Now me and this gay friend have spent a LOT of time alone together, walking in the woods, sleepovers, the gym, grocery shopping, etc. I’ve shared beds with her and changed in front of her and stuff like that, stuff I wouldn’t have done if I’d known she was crushing on me. I thought we were just friends, and I wasn’t going to stop hanging out with her just because she was gay.

Now I’m in an awkward spot because I don’t want to call her out on it, but I feel weird doing stuff alone with her when she wants to be more than friends. "

Girls if a kid from your Primary messaged you after 10 years and you both had crushes what would be your reaction? Ps no I haven’t obsessed over her all this time.
2147,difu9u,Adultinneedoffreedom,Running away from Hell to pursue Heaven,"In need of some serious advice. Ok... for starters I am 24 years old and have literally nothing going for me except pain. I live in a small town in the deep south a place where there are no opportunities for advancement in terms of the workforce beyond low level blue collar jobs like fast food worker, farmhand etc. So no joy in professional life. 


I have no joy in my personal life either as I have no friends or girls to hang out with let alone a girlfriend. I consider myself to be one of if not the most lonely people in the world cause basically my life consists of staying in my bedroom trying to find something to distract myself with so I can make it through each day. I have zero moments of socialization other than brief periods of time at work and its usually only with one person as I work at his farm. I moonlight occasionally with some carpenter work here and there but still... I hope you get the picture. 


Now the worst thing is my family. Yes I still live with my family at the age of 24 but that isn't the bad part. The bad part is I was raised by a family of abusers who effectively killed off any potential that I had in living a normal life. My mother took me out of public school at an early age and home schooled me to ensure in her words that ""I wouldn't become influenced by the evils of the outside world."" She put all her own anxieties and paranoia upon me and at one time had me believing when I was a young child that parts of the outside world didn't exist that it was just all make believe. 

My father was and still is a magician now you see him now you dont. He would just flat out disappear for months at a time and would show up announced like it was the most normal thing in the world. I think I might've had 10 total conversations with him in my life. Literally the man doesn't want to talk to anybody.  What I later discovered about my father was that all that time he spent away from home was spent on alcoholic benders. I suppose drinking himself into blackouts was his own way of coping with the bizarreness that was our home. He is the one I put the least amount of blame on. I guess mainly because he is like a stranger to me instead of a family member. So the feelings just aren't there. Good or bad. 



My older brother is the worst of the lot and the real abuser. When I was a kid he would scream and cuss at me, bark and growl at me like a vicious dog, threatened to stab me with knives, throwed things, punched and kicked, and on one occasion he pulled one of my father's shotguns out on me and threatened to blow my head off all because I accidentally knocked over one of his gaming consoles. He was 18 and I was 10. All the abuse he inflicted has left me with nothing but pure unadulterated HATE for him. I literally cannot even stand to hear his voice. 


Now that I have given a little bit of backstory here is what I want to do. I want to leave and start over. Put this town and these painful memories in my rearview mirror. I have some savings and a vehicle and I want to head out to California and try and change my pitiful existence around into something more ordinary something more humane you could say. I have no logical reasons to stay and nothing to keep me here. I have been studying and know I can take care of myself. 


So my question is should I do it? Would you do it if you were me? Or would you stay and try to pick up the pieces here? I'm just scared that if I don't go then things will just remain the same and that terrifies me more than anything I have ever went through because I know if they do I will not be able to take it. I cannot allow myself to still be in the same position that I am in now when I'm in my 30s. 
I have already missed out on most of my life and I do not want to miss out on anymore. 

So any advice? Anything at all would be greatly appreciated. And I apologize if this post wasn't the most cohesive as I am in a pretty emotional state right now and cannot think or type as clearly as I usually do."

I wish I could just tell my mum, and get a hug off her. I think she is the one I would want to confide in out of all the people in the world.

But she is the reason I am with a woman anyway. When I was younger... I got found out for living with a guy, and my mum asked me point blank ‘are you gay?’

And I said no (I didn’t think I was, I was in denial), but then she pretended it was ok and I could tell her anything and she loved me regardless. So I told her ‘maybe’, and she absolutely flipped.

She was very much, ‘how could you do this to the family’, and then my dad got involved, ‘how could you put your mother through this’. I said I was really really sorry and it was just a phase etc.
She said it was for the best if I got help and stopped and moved away. So I did that.

I can’t tell my wife, obviously. 

I don’t have any gay friends who would understand, and I don’t get along with gay people.

I think I might post too much on the internet and people don’t understand why I’m with a woman. I can’t be with a man. But I just wish someone would give me a hug and I could tell them how I feel sometimes."

1760,dk31os,RealToday,School teacher needing advice about former student,"Hey guys, 

I just want to preface this by saying that I'm a bit of a chronic worrier. I have been for the majority of my life and it's just something I can't help. 

So I'm a young teacher who started in a new school last year. I had the oldest students in the school who were partaking their final year exams. It was a big task taking it on in my first year, but we got through it and they managed to do very well overall. 

Anyway, I had the most amazing relationship with these students. We worked so well together. And honestly, I miss them. 
One of them in particular wants to train to be a teacher with the same subjects as my own. At the end of the year I emailed her back and forth a few times telling her that she's always got help with me if she should be need it and I gave her my number. 
Now it should be mentioned that I'm a guy. I was even nervous about doing that in this day and age with PC culture, but I asked my sister who was the same age, and she thought it was sweet and an extremely nice gesture. 

Anyway, this girl added me on Snapchat through the number. I thought about it accepting but I was so anxious that people would think I was doing something wrong. I encouraged her to stay in touch and we were always very informal in the way we spoke. I have no intention of anything of a sexual nature. 

My question is, that was about 3 months ago. The request is still there. Do you guys think it's okay to accept that request?  Would it be strange to accept so long afterwards? I'm just fearful of this PC culture who will misinterpreted it for something I would never do. What do you think?"

My situation for the past few years has felt particularly odd, shameful, embarrassing, and deeply disappointing to myself and what I, perceive, to those around me. I wrote it out for you all. Just looking for some help on where to start…..

· I’m a second year medical student at a respected allopathic program. Currently about to finish 2nd year curriculum, albeit late. Opted to take a year off because I needed more time to take the USMLE Step 1 exam \(major exam that plays an important factor for residency applications\). Live with my parents and my brother \(just graduated from college and returned recently\).

· Note: My medical school works in blocks \(you have one course for a month or two, then another course\).

· Smoking and Education History

o H.S\-College Y4: I started smoking weed for the first time in high school. I went to a city school and was offered weed at parties. I would smoke several times per year. Always enjoyed it. Never really drank that much. College did not involve drugs or drinking all that much either. I wanted to become a doctor so badly and was focused at that time.

o College Y5: At the end of four years, I won a scholarship to study an extra year at my undergraduate. With most of my friends gone, my current girlfriend in medical school, and getting ready to apply to medical school, I began to smoke weed that year out of boredom. Started slowly smoking once or twice a week, then I started spending a lot of money on it, and it began progressing to every day after work was done.

o Gap Year: At the end of my fifth year, I moved back home and I did a gap year working with impoverished students while I applied to medical school. Smoked weed every day after work in my parents house to “relax” from working with kids for effectively 3 dollars an hour.

o Medical School Year 1: Moved into a house with two medical students. Smoked everyday after class, would study high, and sleep a lot. Didn’t go to class ever if it wasn’t mandated \(we had recorded lectures, so workshop like once or twice a week in the morning with patient activities once a week in the afternoon\). Did not go to class high or take tests high or see patients high. Did a lot of half assed working in my room though. Everyone thought I was studying all the time, but I was just smoking and studying/Netflix/reading and not doing things efficiently. Didn’t fail anything \(20th percentile of class\), but had to take a break in the spring because I developed severe depression from the combination of isolation, smoking all the time, and trying to study all the time too. Came back, finished the year and used the summer to finish the course I missed. Wasted a lot of money on stupid shit while high and weed.

o Medical School Year 2: Due to my depression and problems with smoking \(I had tried to stop during this time\) I moved back to my parents house. Quit smoking for a few weeks when I moved home, and then it trickled once into my life again. By the end of the first block of second year, I was smoking at night after dinner. The shame of it is, I was happy in the beginning of that second year. I passed all my courses and was competent for awhile. Confident even. But I somehow found myself smoking again. I became super depressed in the winter and took about 1.5 months off \(literally the worst and most disabling experience of my life\). At the same time that I gathered the will power to quit smoking for a few weeks \(so probably related\). However, I used alcohol at night to deal with the withdraw \(don’t actually really like drinking, but my depression was so wacky I was desperate for anything. Not trying to say it’s a good thing but just disclaiming \). Then used Percocet that I had from a medical procedure awhile back to get high for a week \(again, was extremely desperate to feel something else, not something I would think to do again\). Then I had about a week of sobriety and was happy. Excited to get back to school. A few days before I started school, I smoked once. And then it trickeled into my life. I finished my second year courses with my classmates, but jumped right into finishing that 1.5 months of work I had taken off. Since then, my work has had ups and downs in productively. Mostly downs lately.

o Current Situation: About 1.5 months in and about to take in a week final exam. Did okay on the midterm, but now I am kinda screwed because I have not worked efficiently so now I am trying to catch up. Schedule has been work in the morning for 10\-1. Smoke. Work 3\-6. Eat dinner. Smoke and study/Netflix until midnight. Will find a way to pass the final exam by studying a ton.

o Soon Future: I have this exam early in the week, and then I gave myself a week of no medical school work before I start studying for the step 1 exam 8 hours/ day / 6x /week. I gave myself 3 months to complete it.

· I still live with my parents, have very little/no friends, and feel burnt out all the time.

· I like medical school. I love it to be honest. I love the medical sciences, I have had good experience in clinic \(also some really bad ones where I embarrassed myself for not being on top of my game, other stories\), and I easily find myself in flow when I’m studying or in clinic. I’m split between OBGYN, Anesthesia, and Palliative Care as possible specialties \(enjoyable and interesting experiences in clinic and studying\). But it’s hard to do well at medicine when I’m smoking all the time, when I don’t have many friends, and when I feel this burnt out from doing nothing but studying and weed.

· I want to get sober, join the Physicians Health Program \(I would have to pee in a cup randomly and I would get committed to treatment if it ever came up dirty.\), and get my life together. Become a doctor, be happy, and get over this phase of my life. But I don’t know how, and I don’t know how to evaluate myself right now. I feel like a piece of shit."
24636,96yh10,carmander1792,"I’ve (26, F) been abused, and I need help with the flashbacks.","So let me start from the beginning. When I was in kindergarten, I had a bully. Like most kids. The difference with this story is. My bully, became my step brother. My dad didn’t know it, but the woman he left my mom for, her kid would pick on my everyday at school. Now I don’t remember what happened to me at school with him, but I do remember that he started getting clever with his tactics after the move. I was the oldest of 3 kids, when he was the youngest of two. So when we all moved in together. He started bullying my brother and sister as well. He would put them down verbally, break their toys, or physically beat on them. Keep in mind, him and I are both 5 at the time. But that didn’t stop this kid from telling me that if I didn’t do what he said, that he would keep hurting my siblings. So me wanting to protect my siblings, I listened to him. And he meant it. If I didn’t do what he said. He would hurt my siblings. He would pull me into my closet and pull his pants down and tell me to do things to him. And the first time I told him no. Then he went and started beating up my brother. So of course I did what he said after that. Then one day his mom opened the closet to me on my knees and him standing there with his pants down. And she pulled him out and left me there and closed the door. Before this, she always verbally abused us(my siblings and I). She would also manipulate our little minds. She would do stuff to us (like put peed on underwear on my sister head) and then tell us someone else did it(she said my grandma did that to my sister, even though I clearly watched her). And because I knew she could do this, i couldn’t trust my own thoughts. After she found us in the closet, I was told it was my fault. That I instigated it. Things didn’t stop there with the step brother either. He knew his mom would protect him and do anything for him. So he continued. And still beat up my siblings if I did what he wanted. It took me 15 years after that to know that it wasn’t my fault. But now that I’ve been battling these flashbacks for years. I don’t know what to do. I have so many questions. Why did he bully me? Why did he do those things to me just to go against his word? Why did his mom let me think it was my fault? Does my dad know? And if so, why hasn’t he done anything about it? So on and so forth. 

I guess what I need advice on is: Do I go to my dad? It’s been 21 years. Do I tell him? Do I ask if he knows? I know I need to go back to do talk therapy. But I can’t find a good doctor either. I’m working on finding one still. But for now, I’m turning to the people. Seeing if anyone else has a similar story. And if so, how do you cope? Does your family know? What helps you the most when your brain slips and can’t be strong anymore? Please I would like to know. At the moment I just smoke weed to subside the flashbacks and keep moving forward. I’m hoping that’s not a permanent fixed.  But if so, it’s better than alcohol I suppose. But please. Don’t be shy. I would love to hear your stories and what you do to help yourself. 

I hope your day is going well! Thank you for your time! "
35117,7xm400,DramaticTouch,he would rather watch porn,"A few weeks back, it came to my attention that my boyfriend had made an Instagram. He wasn't following me, no, but he was following porn stars who looked barely 18 (for reference I'm 22). Anyways, I told him how disrespectful I thought that was (mind you that who he follows on Instagram is public information) and he refused to apologize, saying I was insane for assuming he doesn't look at or watch porn. I get that watching porn is common, but it really bothers me that he still does that when we're in a relationship, and have been for 6 months. I send him nudes and stuff, so the fact that he needs to get off to other women upsets me. He responded by saying ""you're just mad that I find other girls attractive."" No, I'm mad that you're masturbating to other girls! I tried to talk openly with him and explain my perspective, but he flat-out told me that he would rather watch porn than be in a relationship with me. I didn't want to breakup over that so we're still together, but the more I think about it (the whole situation) the more it bothers me."
7079,crz3m4,KelsiesArtDump,Should I forgive my friend?,"Let me just give a rundown—
My friend participated in bullying me, making fun of my sexual assault experience, spread rumors and very misleading videos of me, and abandoned me when I didn’t have someone there. My dad lost his job, and I had to work all the time to help support the family, and he didn’t believe me, and told me I was ‘ghosting him for no reason’. He told me I couldn’t sing and then later blamed the song choice being bad, so therefore my voice was bad. He made fun of me for liking/drawing furry art (not even the inappropriate stuff) and called me disgusting. At one point, it got really bad and I slapped him, and he pushed me back and made fun of me for falling down. We were playing truth or dare, and he dared me to lick a hatsune miku poster. He recorded it without my knowledge and it got to almost everyone in the school. And he didn’t even think about apologizing. Until now because I stopped talking to him. 

Here is the text he sent me:

“sorry for everything
i know you've repeatedly told me that is fine but it’s not for me
sorry for making that rape joke in the cafeteria, with you slapping me and falling down (lmao)
sorry for calling you nasty when you were looking at those furry pics  and everything
sorry for insulting that good song you sang, calling it trash because of its origin
sorry for not apologizing sooner for that
and i am so, SO sorry for leaking that video of licking your hatsune miku poster (it was lowkey kinda hot tho)
im sorry for everything
and i am truly sorry for not being there when you were being isolated at school
and i am sorry for doubting your story when you ghosted me
and i am so sorry for bothering you so much with these texts
i wanted to apologize in person, at church, but i just can't wait anymore eh? 
im so sorry for everything I've done to you”

Should I forgive him?

TLDR: my friend screwed me over and caused/took part in serious bullying for an entire year, and wants my forgiveness."

We were waitging for good moment to do it but never really had a chance, but now something happend that really concerns me.

So, we were at the party and came back to my dorm pretty late. There was my roommate sleeping with his girl (who got wasted few hours ago btw) and were pretty hard sleeping. We showered and jumped to my bed and you know started some fun. All of the sudden she is naked and trying to put my penis inside her. So, I thought maybe she figured that they (my roommate) won't be waken up by us so wanted to do it. I asked to put on the condom. To which she reply ""Noo, let's go to sleep"". Okey? Fine, I lay down next to her and she is starting to move and again trying to do something, again I ask, again same answer. 

I now forced myself to bathroom in which I write this cause I'm kinda scared deep down that she... She might do something in my sleep. I know, I know it sounds really dumb but I don't know. I felt really odd... and uncomfortably.

What do you think guys? Is it me or there is something I should be really worried about?

And oh, I really like her, like really really, but it's not the time to have kids, I'm not in any way shape or form able to provide now for a kid. It's first time happening something like that."

Perhaps a paralegal? A law clerk sounds appealing, and writing/drafting opinions are my strong points. 

I like Justice. Specifically, I’d like to play a part in reforming our criminal justice system. Would a paralegal even be effective, then?

So every single night, after I get through with my daily tasks and have some time to relax, I get online and game with some friends. Without fail, every night, my brother makes his way into the kitchen, standing directly above where my computer desk is, just listening. If he's in his room, there's total silence and I can hear him by the vent at times.

Now, this may be important to add, but he does have schizophrenia. He's medicated, but sometimes things like this happen. I'm at my wit's end. I can tell he's listening in, he doesn't try to hide it. There are times he's listening and starts stomping. 

I don't know what I should do about this, but I also have no idea why he'd want to listen in on his 28 year old sister. Is there anything I can do? I'm actually talking less and less now because of this, and scared to even engage with friends over it.

18717,b5pui4,curlyfrywithsomesauc,Panicking because of college applications and such.,"I’m currently in my senior year of high school and I’m very stressed out over college applications. I don’t know if I should go to a regular art school and potentially fall into debt or go to an atelier school. I’ve already applied for two art schools which are SVA and Pratt along with a few art schools nearby. Then I applied for an atelier school, Florence Academy of Art. I’d like to go to Florence because the school seems to teach way more than regular art school and it’s cheaper. But SVA and Pratt will provide me a Masters degree (I want to become an art professor) but I’ll end up in debt. 

I’m very unsure of what to do. I don’t want to drag my parents into my debt issue if I go to SVA or Pratt. But I also don’t want to go to Florence then struggle in the long run when I’m trying to pay the bills because I didn’t get my Masters degree and become an art professor. "

Sorry for the long post but I really need this advice.

Just recently my dad told me I cannot go in my room except for sleeping. The reason behind that is because he thinks that I spend too much time in my room. (I do spend the majority of my time in there).

I spend most of my time there watching YouTube and playing games on my PC (that I paid for with my money by working), I have friends that I made in the past but I don't like hanging out. I have been dealing with anxiety and depression for quite a while now. My grades have been going down even though I am very capable. The only class I am doing well in is physics and that's just because I'm good at math.

My dad told me he saw on the news or something that phones and Fortnite are taking over children's brains or whatever (I don't have a phone nor do I play Fortnite) He knows I have anxiety but doesn't really think to care and starts doing the whole ""In the old days I played outside with my neighbours kicking cans..."" I don't consider myself addicted to any of that.

Now he thinks that I am addicted to Fortnite and apparently staying in my room ""Isolating myself from the world"" and now bans me from using electronics or being in my room (I am writing this on my school computer), I have nothing else to do but sit and wait for nothing.

Any help or advice on what to do would be extremely appreciated, thanks everyone!"
13699,buzpyw,steakandcheeseyum,I’m about to get my ass whooped by my parents.,"I have failed one of my exams, horribly. The grades haven’t been sent out yet but I know for a fact that I got a low F, no hope for a D. I’m not too concerned however. Everyone I asked failed as well. The teacher is awful, and the exam was nothing like the excuse of a study guide we were provided. I got an A on all the other exams, and I have in A in all my classes, so an F on 1 exam won’t affect my overall grade too much. The problem? My parents will absolutely ruin my life. I’m guaranteed to get an ass whooping, and I’m sure that they will ground me and do the silent treatment for the entire damn summer. Right now, I’m scared and I don’t know what to do. Should I confess right now, or wait for the grades to be emailed? My parents are very strict, and I don’t have the guts to tell them that I failed an exam. I can’t bare seeing them turn from a good mood to angry. They’re the type of parents to flip out if I got a bad homework grade. An F on an exam?... yeah I’m absolutely fucked. I never failed anything higher than a test before, so I’m pretty nerve wrecked and concerned of what my parents will do to me. Telling them I got an A on everything else won’t help my case, because they already expect straight As from me. In fact, nothing I say will help. I’m about to bite the biggest bullet of my life.

16429,bi4rs6,logmoon,I’m a senior and an undergrad student. I may fail a required class and it feels like my whole life is fucked. What can I do?,"I’m an undergrad student at my state university, I’m a senior but need to take two classes this summer and then I’ll graduate (not that it’s important really but I know normal graduation happens during Spring semester, but I’m graduating early, not late).

For my major, I need to take 3 out of 9 available core classes, I’ve taken and passed 2 already. This semester I took the final one class I needed and haven’t been doing great. The teacher is an old tenured asshole. He’s condescending and pedantic and his class isn’t what it’s supposed to be (his course material is only loosely related to the course description, he basically only teaches what he wants and his area of study  and ties it back weakly to what the class should be). He’s rude to students and doesn’t articulate his expectations at all. I can rant for days about how awful a professor he is.

The class is set up with two projects, a midterm, and a final. Each exam is 30% and each project is 20%. Everyone got a 100 on the first project. The midterm I got a 61% on. I realized I need to step it up for the final and I studied hard and walked out feeling great. I got my grade back today and it was a 54% which included 5 points extra credit. I don’t think I’ll pass. I can if he gives out all 100% on the second presentation, but I don’t know if that will happen or not. Even then, he is technologically inept. His syllabus doesn’t explain the breakdown of the grades, I had to ask him for those percentages in class, so they aren’t in writing. He doesn’t understand the online service Canvas, the way the grades are weighted in Canvas aren’t how he told the whole class, and I’m afraid he doesn’t realize and will not weight them properly. If that happens, even a 100% on project 2 will still mean I fail. And because I don’t have these numbers in writing, there’s nothing I can do except hope other students will back me up that that’s what he said. 

I know people will say to fill the requirement this summer, but there is only 1 class that would fulfill it, and it’s full. Not just one course with multiple class times, but just one class. I can try to appeal to the professor and see if they can manually put me in, but who knows if that will work. 

I feel like if I don’t pass my world is just fucked. I don’t even care about my GPA bc that isn’t the biggest problem. It’s not just a normal situation of “oh don’t let one failure bring you down, it isn’t the end of the world” because it feels like the end of the world. If I don’t pass, it looks awful on my transcript because I failed a core class in my major, that’s pretty big. I’ve spent months job searching and all that goes down te frail because I won’t be able to start until December, because I’ll likely have to stay in the fall. I wasn’t planning on staying here after graduation so I don’t have an apparement and I cannot renew my lease, it’s too late. Not to mention all the pressure that’ll come from my family. I’m on a full ride scholarship, i luckily won’t lose it, but I will have to pay back the cost of the class. My dad pays for my rent and groceries and textbooks. Knowing my dad, he’ll make me pay it, which I can’t really afford because I quit my job this semester because the pressures of school and having multiple internships was too much to also work part time. 

I feel like my world is ending and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to cope or how to help myself. I found out this morning and I can’t bring myself to eat, shower, or even leave bed. I can’t tell my family yet, my boyfriend 1) graduated last semester so we’re doing long distance right now so he 2) doesn’t know how to help me being so far away, especially when I can’t even muster enough energy to call and talk. and I have one friend, who is going through her own stuff and can’t talk to me about it.

18288,b810lm,vim_ai,How to reject someone who isn’t in a very good place mentally and is vey persistent,"For good measure I am a female in high school.

So there is this girl who I met at a performance at school. She seemed to instantly take a liking to me and since then has been making me uncomfortable with not very subtle flirting and close proximity. She seems to follow me around when she can despite being a grade above me, and texts me over. I’ll make her alias “Nicole”.

Nicole has severe anxiety. Really, really severe anxiety. She gets panic attacks really quickly (I’ve witnessed one of hers before, it was one of the worst I’ve seen). 

I’ve already told Nicole that I disliked her flirting and that I probably will say no if she were to ask me out but she’s constantly trying to win me over anyways and I have no clue what to do. 

She texts me very often and I don’t usually reply. She tries to guilt trip me into calling her but I don’t really want to.

We went to the movies once (before I realized she liked me) and she took pictures of me. I’ve asked her to delete them but I’m not sure if she has. 

Nicole also constantly talks about her family situation. Everything we talk about eventually leads to her father being ill. It’s not helping me mentally either, but I don’t want to hurt her so I always listen.

I’m worried that rejecting her so soon will hurt her (she mentioned that she doesn’t want a “no” ‘right now’ whatever that means) but I really don’t like her and I don’t think I ever will.

Is there anyway to stop her without hurting her too much and causing drama?

I was getting to know the ropes of the business and the people so she witnessed my fair share of trials and tribulations. Let's just say she got away with alot of shit because I was still in training. Awhile ago when we worked an event, she complained to one of the owners that I was being ""too demanding."" I talked to the owners, whom I'm pretty close with, and they backed me up. They know I'm a very hard worker. She doesn't know that I know what she said. So I backed off but kept a close eye on her.

Trying to get Lazy to do anything is like pulling teeth. I've done everything I can ; leading by example, asking nicely, being assertive... nothing seems to work. If I tell her to do something, she moves at a glacier's pace. If she sees my clean her table, she stands there and watches me. She is constantly on her phone or snacking in the back, I've got a whole laundry list! When she's not doing anything, she is at the front gossiping with our opening manager (the both of them are buddy buddy with each other). I can't confide in or trust our opening manager without her telling Lazy everything. When I do confront our opening manager, she denies gossip.

I stopped asking Lazy for help because it is much easier for me to complete the tasks since I can't depend on her for shit. 

I've had multiple meetings with the owners regarding her behavior / lack of work and for some reason she is still here. I've asked for help in how to handle this and they tell me not to worry... that pretty soon, they'll be hitting the ""reset button"". I feel like all I do is complain about Lazy. I don't know what to do anymore..."

38102,7npgpv,hollybrown81,Spent $1000 to find out my friend was using me,"Hey everyone,
My “best friend” got married earlier 2017. I was her MOH, and none of her bridesmaids would contribute, so I footed a lot of the bills for bridal shower/bachelorette party. Overall, I spent over $1,000 to be in my friends wedding. I figured whatever, she’d do the same for me. As her wedding got closer, she started to phase me out. She met a girl at work, and they became good friends. So after the wedding, my friend ghosted me. She started tagging this other person in a lot of Facebook posts about “best friends” and every time I texted her, she would never ask how I was, and she’d only text me first if she wanted something. It’s always about her.

So I took some space for a couple months (didn’t ignore her, I just didn’t initiate the conversation.) when i texted her to see how she was, she told me she bought a house and asked for my help painting and moving. I went over to help paint, but she never let me know when she was moving. She texted me on a Saturday to ask if I was coming to help her move, and when I told her I was sick she never responded. 

Is this friendship worth salvaging? Should I even try? 

Edit:
Thanks everyone for the super sweet comments! I’m normally pretty shy, so I don’t have a lot of friends. I must attract all the users-this is definitely not the first time, just the hardest I’ve had letting go. When I love someone, I can’t help but want to be there for them. It’s hard to see when you need to cut ties "
12090,c353n1,Unruly_Tambourine,"Work place drama leading to terminations and depression. I want out, but don't know how.","So, this is kind of a doozy and it's been going on for a couple months now. It's coming to a head and it's putting me into a corner where I need to make a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for any jumping around with information or if I leave something out. I'm just stressed.

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a veterinary clinic and when I started it was really nice. Everyone got along really well and I loved going to work to be able to talk and joke with everyone. Working as a part-timer I didn't always get to be around when things went on and it's been like walking on egg shells trying to stay on the good side of everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's why. I don't know when or exactly why it started, but a veterinarian who works there and I actually met by chance while we were both just on our way out of school. I working as a tech and she obviously a vet. We hit it off well as friends and it just so happened that she was about to be employed by the very clinic that was in the same town I lived in and eventually was hired on with. Because of this experience working together and our relative newness to the environment they wanted us to stop working together. This was after several weeks of already working very well together. I had no issue with them wanting us to work with experienced people, but it was a little annoying that they couldn't even let me check in a client for something simple. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even though they don't want us working together, somewhere in the time of working there drama began to unfold and the other techs would refuse wanting to work with the newer vet, all of them chasing after one of the more veteran vets because they were all buddies, and for some reason unknown to me they just didn't want to work with the newer vet (who is very kind and patient). Detailing every single rude act against her would take a while, but things like blatantly ignoring her when she asked for help, walking away from her when her clients showed up so they didn't have to check them in, playing hot potato with patients she had to do surgery on because they didn't want to do anesthesia for her, purposely putting the worst clients on her schedule or not putting any on for her at all, badgering her to hurry up or telling her she was doing something not as good as the other vets, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It got worse after some of the more veteran staff went to a birthday party for the old receptionist from the clinic and someone from that party told a client that the new vet was only temporary at the clinic. Which, is not true. Our groomer had found out about this statement through the very client who heard it at the party. The groomer (who is not employed by the clinic owner, but rents part of the building) ended up talking to our boss and told her what she had heard in hopes of squashing that rumor and to have someone maybe talk to the staff and fix the issue. Somehow, this backfired and my boss told everyone not to trust the groomer because she was a “shit-stirrer.” From that day on, no one was allowed to talk to her. It was upsetting to me to hear this because the groomer is a VERY nice lady and does not deserve that sort of false title to be going around about her.

&amp;#x200B;

This makes it so awkward because I, out of the four techs am the only one who is talking to everyone.  Our boss refuses to even step foot into the back room where the groomer works and everyone else acts as if she's just another wall they don't need to acknowledge. They are doing similar things to the receptionist who is treated horribly. She's quite competent with her job, but any slight mistake and everyone is on her about it. (If anyone else makes mistakes of the veteran crowd it's all shrugged off as a ha-ha joke.) One of the doctors has cussed her out so many times that everyone in the building can hear it, including clients. The others gossip and talk poorly on clients from the back room sometimes and of course clients can hear all of these things and the receptionist has to apologize to them for it. I really don't know how none of the clients have spoken up about it to any of the other staff.

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned that our boss and the receptionist had a meeting when she was first hired and they agreed on a certain wage. When she went to get insurance for her kids she needed paystubs and went to our boss for them. Yes, our boss doesn't supply us with paystubs. So, when she finally got the total of what she had made for the year she realized it was significantly lower than what she and our boss had agreed she would be paid. The receptionist went to her and addressed this the very next day and our boss told her that, while yes she recalled that discussion she wouldn't be paying her the wages she was owed because they allegedly couldn't afford it. Yet of course, they can afford buying and professionally training two draft horses and all these other expensive animals and other items I won't list. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, I've tried to stay as Switzerland as possible with how I treat people, but I've also experienced being blatantly ignored, gossiped about, and treated like I was a true idiot for ""mistakes"" that not all were actually my fault. I will admit to things I fuck up, but being told to draw up certain drug dosages for animals by the vet and then suddenly it's wrong because they want it a new way is not my fault. Any and all issues my boss has with anyone is NEVER spoken about with the person who they have an issue with, but gossiped about and told literally to everyone BUT that person. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boss calls everyone else but the ""problem people"" and asks what's going on, what us specific problem people are doing and wants the others to snitch on us for things she thinks we are doing wrong. My boss will do everything in her power to not have to talk to people about issues going on, she only cares to gossip and shake her finger from a distance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forwarding a bit, one of my coworkers plans on starting a grooming/boarding business elsewhere and this was meant to be kept on the DL, but small towns know everything and word spread about it. A client came in and mentioned that she heard one of the girls was opening up a place in a neighboring town to one of the other staff members and obviously this news to them. Not ten minutes later our boss calls to speak to her favorite snitch who wasn't working that day. This morning the groomer found a termination letter telling her she had to leave two days before the end of the month. She's been working there for twenty some years, and does not have a contract with them, but has paid consistently to be there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this week the newer vet took a sick day for mental health reasons regarding the clinic. She did not disclose the reason for taking a sick day, just that she was. Well, apparently they located her by snapchat's geo-whatever I don't use snapchat I don't know the name of it. Essentially, they saw that she wasn't at home, but at her relative's house and our boss texted her asking why she was in a different town and now they have a meeting come Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

All these people that are being forced out, bullied, and treated without respect are people I consider myself closest to because I don't have as much in common with the other staffers and they've just treated me so hot and cold. (Not to mention how off-putting their racism is because I am a rather white-looking POC.) I've been invited to work at this new business opening up and I plan to take it, but I don't know when or how I should leave this clinic. I want to remain on good terms because I do have several pets, some that are up there in age. I do have some personal issues I've kept to myself about how in the past I've been told by the boss that because I didn't buy hyper-thyroid medication for my cat from the clinic, and instead bought it for a significantly cheaper price at the local pharmacy that I would not be helped with emergencies with any pets because of it. (Surprisingly not an uncommon thing she threatens other clients with.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I've left out plenty of other drama, but all I really care about is getting an outside voice about this. On what I should do, how I should leave cordially. I cannot handle this drama anymore as the toxicity going around is too much for my mental health to take on after still trying to deal with the loss of immediate family members and a plethora of other personal issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a long post, but I feel like I'm drowning and just really need a hand to help me out. Thank you."

39117,7krm0x,notathrowaway836,Tonight my boyfriend told me that he molested his cousins when he was younger. I don’t know what to do.,"Hi,

Possible trigger warning. 

For reference, we are both 21. 

So my boyfriend just revealed a really big secret to me. He said that at age 12, he molested 2 of his female cousins, who were 5 and 6. He said that he rubbed their legs and kissed one of them, as well as asking them to pull down their pants as part of a ‘game’, but it didn’t go farther than that. Later on he admitted that he touched the vagina of one of the girls, but she seemed so uncomfortable that he stopped. He told me he feels guilty and horrible and he’s never told anyone before me. He also said he was suicidal over it and hasn’t had a happy day in 9 years since. 

I’m in shock. I don’t know what to do. I told him he needs to see a therapist or I won’t stay with him, and he agreed. 

I know this kind of exploration isn’t normal because of the age gap. He said when he was 6-7, him and a cousin of the same age would make out and pretend to have sex. I think maybe that messed him up? I just don’t know. 

I found out a few years ago that when my Dad was a kid, his younger brothers accused him of molesting/raping them. Now I’m scared that there’s something wrong with me. It can’t be a coincidence that my boyfriend did the same thing. 

Please...any advice will help. 

**TL;DR** my boyfriend molested his younger cousins when he was a child. I don’t know if this makes him a horrible person or wht I should do. 

Eta: he swears up and down that he was never molested. He blamed it on selfishness and stress (an older cousin of his was suicidal, and my boyfriend was the only one who knew). "

I've been looking for jobs since January because I was sure I would drop out of college because of mental health problems and today I received a call telling me that I got the job. I start on Monday and I'm so happy because this will be my first serious job.

The problem is that it's 45 minutes from where I live, it's in a city. I live in a village where I don't have any good memories. I even did high school in the city because I didn't want to see anyone from my village. I have my life there, I made good friends there and met my actual boyfriend.

The actual problem: I will get out of work at 10pm and won't have a ride home. I told my boyfriend if I could sleep at his house if I get a job there so this is why I accepted the offer. However, I don't want to stay at his house not even for a month because he lives with his family and it's not fair, so I've been thinking about moving out with someone else. 

My mum will not accept me moving out because she thinks I'm not mature enough for that and my brother who's 31 lives with us so it would be very weird for her to see me move out before him. She'll also ask me why accepted the offer if I don't have a way to come home, but I can't tell her that in a way this is an excuse to move out because I can't stand anymore living in a village that doesn't help to my mental health.

I’m not the same anymore- better in some ways, but for the most part, I feel like I’m not on top of much concerning myself for my age. 

For example, I was supposed to start drivers ed at 14 1/2 y/o. I remember being excited about it yesterday. I remember being excited to get a job, and now I do nothing and am self aware of my own leeching habits of those around me due to their ability to drive, pay for food, etc. I’ve abused it, albeit subconsciously, but nonetheless I have. Another example is that I’ve got a very serious relationship that I’ve had going on a while. When I was younger, a year or so back, I took her on genuinely decent dates to nice places, but my parents paid because I did chores and was young and lucky enough. Now, we just hit our year and a half, and I didn’t even take her to dinner, and barely gave a present for her birthday. 

There are worse things to do, but I’m not proud of who I’ve become and what I’m doing with my life as of this point. I’m not dumb, I know I’m not, because I would’ve been shit out of luck years ago, yet I lack the work ethic or motivation. 

The worst part of it is my health. I’m a pothead, I’ve smoked daily for 3 years straight now, with the obvious breaks sometimes. But it’s bad, and so is my sleep schedule. My physical health was also way better a long time ago, so mentally and physically I’m just not me anymore. It’s not even about looks, it’s about not feeling under the weather or groggy or irritable. 

To everyone reading, it may seem like pandering to compliments or support, but that’s not my goal here. I’m just kind of trying to explain my perspective, so please bear with me if you will. 

Generally, the only things keeping me going are my girlfriend, family, friends and drugs. I don’t have much to say for myself. I haven’t done anything to proud of recently except make it this far.  I suppose I wrote this post because, like I said, I’m not entirely stupid, just kind of lost and don’t know what to do to even get myself the strength to get out of bed anymore. School counselors say I have depression and anxiety, and parents/close friends say I’m always stressed, so I’m clearly not me. 

The point is, I’m lost, and I’m not happy. I know I can be, but I’m not. Not like I was- I remember it. I need help. I could ask a sum of questions but it’d be too long. So, to shorten it: To any adults, or wiser people out there, how do I get back on track? How do I even start? Is there anything I can do get myself back on my feet before I make bigger steps? Is there any habits or small things I can start changing now?

Thanks for reading this far. I probably shared too much but this is pretty anonymous account (I hope). I appreciate any sort of advice I can get, anything you think will help."
18925,b4lmfx,andersensamantha,I [20F] was sexually assaulted by my best friends step father[50+M]. What do I do?,"Last night I was sleeping on my best friends [20F] couch. I woke up to her step father drunkenly touching himself and trying to touch me. He told me let’s go somewhere and I declined, my friends were asleep around me. He just kept telling me to go somewhere with him and I continued to ignore him. I waited until he was making himself another drink to wake up my other friend and quickly leave. 
I don’t know how to act on this situation, it made me very uncomfortable and I don’t want to go back there even though I’ve gone there almost every week for the past 15 years. Her mother and step father have been together for almost 3 years. Do I tell my friend what happened? I am afraid they won’t believe me or it will turn into something so big. I am angry and sad about the whole thing. Anyone have any advice on what I should do? Sorry if I was all over the place, first post on Reddit. "

35904,7uqngh,trhnwy,[Relationship] Am I crazy for pursuing this relationship ?,"Hi everyone. I desperately need advice. Long story short: I met this guy this past july when he came to visit his friend who lived with me. I overlooked his shyness and we had a really great time. He left after three days but we only got together his last. The next day, we said our goodbyes thinking it would never happen again, but kept texting everyday. Really long messages. So we decided to meet again three weeks later, at a festival in the city where he lives. I live in Portugal and he lives in France, so I went to see him and I spent the whole month with him. It was nice but it wasn't great. We went camping, it was my first time. His friend came along and I got lost in the woods, it took me about three hours to finally get to town and call him to pick me up. It was awful to realize he and his friend just kept on drinking and didn't realize I was lost. That was my first disappointment. Anyways, I just stayed there and had a really fun time, but we never spoke about a relatioship. 
I came back to Portugal and we kept texting everyday, so the next month I came back because he said he really wanted to see me again. So I did, another amazing three weeks and still no talks about relationship.
In october we couldn't see each other because I had too much to do in Portugal. So we planned a trip to Italy in November. It was fun, but not amazing. He is very shy and quiet, and doesn't bring up the topic of relationship. Also he never really opens up about his personal life, he doesn't really talk about his family, or the stuff that happens in his life at home. 
I sorta got the idea that we were serious because I kept traveling back and forth to be with him, and in his house with his friends we were together and behaved like boyriend and girlfriend. There was nothing weird. But still never spoke openly about where we stood. I got silent many times because it did really upset me. 
So in december I stayed in Portugal and became distant. Even spoke to his friend who was my roomate about it, she only said that he liked me and he was shy. 
In january, in spite of the lack of proper communication I went to surprise him for his birthday, and that is the time that everyone was like introducing me to new people as his girlfriend and I spoke in private with some of them and they all said that he talks about me as his girlfriend and that he talks a lot about me.
So I was happy but sad in a way, because we never had that conversation, not even when I tried again. 
The thing is, he is really shy, he never talks about many things with me. He seems to be nervous all the time with me.
I hate it.
When we are with his friends, he's always talktive and with women even more. They are  French and I can understand very little of it, so I ask them to speak in English so I can be part of conversations. His friends try but he never does. I can sit there for hours without being part of it and he doesn't seem to care. 
I spoke to him about all of this and still he keeps doing it.
The thing is I'm arranging everything to move there in a week and learn French. But I don't feel like it would be worth it. Even thought he thinks of me as his girlfriend and tells me he loves me, I don't think it's going to be a very good relationship.
I don't know what to do."
27358,8sgqh6,Alcatrax3,Life advice needed! &lt;3,"Ok, so. I need some super honest life advice.... I'm 24/M 

\*p.s, Sorry if it doesn't make sense, I'm really bad at explaining things. \*

I've been struggling for awhile now and I mean struggling. I have 0 motivation, drive, passion... Like, I just cant find the will to do anything, be anything.. I have depression, anxiety and all those lovely mental health problems \*I've seen therapist in the past but always feel like they don't quite understand my problems so I stopped going\*  I can't stop blaming others for this, Regardless if they have actually hurt me or not. I don't have any friend, friends, I'm just known by a few people, No one who I can just ring up and hang with.  I have 4 siblings, All of which dislike me because I'm gay (I live with 2 of them \*Only Sister+Oldest Brother+My Dad) And how do I live when people whom dislike me? Lol... Basically, If I don't, I sleep on the street. I just hide and wait, I get up extremely early when they are sleeping to get things organised \*Food, showering. That type of stuff\* And IF, I do come face-to-face with any of them, I just stare at the ground, hoping they don't notice me as I quickly rush myself back to my room, I realise some people may suggest opening up to my family and seeing if things have changed but, I've done that time and time before, They legit have 0 time for me. My parents have both told me that they would have preferred it if I wasn't born.  (My mother kicked me out when I came out to her) I have only told 2 people since that day, My sister who was cool at first but has completely changed her mind due to her religious views. I told a ""friend"" of like, 15+ years, you know that friend from the very beginning? Yeah, once I told her.... she freaked out and said ""I cannot have somebody so reckless in my life, it will effect my chances at my own happiness""  I tend to avoid people as much as possible now, I've isolated myself. I only leave my house on payday or to buy drugs. \*I'm not addicted to anything, Just a little MJ to take the edge off when the feels are strong or I can't sleep\* I'm extremely shy/introverted, I have no idea how to talk to strangers at the shops, How to make new friends.  I have only have 2 hobbies?interests? - Music and gaming. Neither of them can be anything more then things I like. Trust me, I've tried. I've tried the whole ""Connect with other gay people or people with the same interests/hobbies"" \* I posted a selfie last night, Not sure why or what I was looking to gain from it... It made me feel good for a moment, Then I realised, All the nice comments and up-votes were a lie, I wasn't the person in the picture. It just resulted in me feeling even worse about myself, How could I possibly connect with other people, When I can't even connect with myself? I try and fake happiness, Like I've got it under-control and I know what I'm doing.... But I really don't.

I have worked quite a few different types of jobs over the years, Nothing fancy. And nothing that lasted... I'd always fall into a mind-set of ""I'll just take today off and refresh"" which turned into another day, then another and then I would just not go back. I dunno why I do this, I feel like I get scared because I said something or did something that might be weird. And to add to this, My last job was nearly over 2 years ago, I have only been able to obtain interviews since leaving my last job. \*And Yes, I realise how bad it looks to leave a job like this, I don't use them as references on my resume, I have done short-time roles which I didn't leave and have those bosses give me a reference\*

I'm not quite sure how to handle life... I have no idea what I'm suppose to do..

I contemplate suicide everyday... I've even tried twice... The first time, I cut myself but as soon as I seen blood I freaked out and stopped (I hate blood/needles type of stuff) The 2nd time, I took my mum's heart pressure tablets and sunk whatever was left, I just got really sick.. I haven't tried again, I'm not sure what stops me now, The feeling is so strong. I know, It will happen if I can't turn things around. 

Every time I feel like I've taken a step forward with my life, I instantly think about my problems and instantly go back to my usual self destructive self. And whatever that step was, is now gone... lost in all the thoughts going through my mind.

I'm sure I've left something out but I feel this kinda sums up my current situation.."

Anyways ever since I was a kid, whenever i lay down at night with the lights off, in my head I will like imagine something being really small and it being compared to something way bigger. And for whatever reason it makes me feel like uneasy, or Disturbed. For example, I'll picture like literally a crumb, next to like something normal sized. And I will just feel weird. Or I will picture something normal but microscopic sized. I specifically Remember when I was little. I pictured a gun that was microscopic sized, and it made me feel so uneasy that I started crying. Sounds so weird but to this day I still occasionally do it when I'm laying down. I'm 16 now. It's not anything worrysome, it's just so damn weird.

14583,br9xky,Scarlet1992,"26 year old,...but in my head, I feel like a child? Any advice?","Good morning Reddit! 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so this is a  bit of a long story, but I'll try to compress it. 

Basically, I didn't have a very normal childhood. My parents were rather strict (Military, etc), and we learned at a young age how to put up perfect appearances despite how we truly felt. 

I started being sexually molested by a variety of people by age 6 and it didn't stop until around age 16. 

My father died shortly after I turned 10, and with that, our house truly went into disarray. My mother began hording terribly, we never saw friends or went out. We had to raise ourselves and our little brother. We basically all became little mothers.

Things were tough and fighting between my mother and all of us went on for years. I began self harming in middle school, but nobody knew until I was in college . 

When I was still in HS, my elder sister became pregnant, and I took care of her (father wasn't involved). I helped April cook, clean, and handle bills along with her OB appts. (by this time, we were moving out of mom's house). After my niece was born, I was the absolute second mom. I was changing diapers and making bottles in my sleep. I remember doing homework and having textbooks in one hand, and holding my niece in my other hand. This was around when I was 18, and went well into my college years and adult life (I went to community college and commuted, I couldn't leave the state). 

&amp;#x200B;

So now, fast forward. I'm a 26 year old woman who works a standard desk job. I still live with me sis and help her with my niece, who is now in elementary school. In my niece's eyes, we are both her mothers. She even made me a mother's day card. 

But, I have always had this issue within myself (besides a whole other slew of issues - depression, low self esteem, bipolar disorder, etc), no matter how old I get, I still feel like I'm a teenager. I feel like I never grew up past age 15 or 16, but it's to the point where if I tell someone that I'm 26 years old, I feel like I'm lying to myself. When I wear business professional clothing, I feel like I'm playing dress up. Why do I feel this way?? 

My current boyfriend of 6 months is super mature, like, he goes out of his way to make himself look and act older. So when we go out together, we literally look like a teacher and a student. 

I wish I could be like him and ""act my age"" but, I literally don't know how. It's like I don't know who the hell I am. 

I need help, but I don't know where to start. 

Sometimes I just want him to hold me, tuck me in, and tell me it's going to be okay because that was never done for me. But he gets so weirded out by the idea of women ""acting out of their age"". It's not like I choose to do this, it's just natural for me. 

Any advice??"

9093,ci6t5x,Blasayy,My parents want to come over but I think my girlfriend wouldn’t be ok with it,"I currently live in Canada with my girlfriend in modest size apartment, where we have a living room, bedroom, kitchen, one bathroom, and a study room where we have desks and also a sofa that unfolds into a bed. We are paying rent 50/50, but my parents pay for my rent while I am in university. My parents live in Europe and I get to see them once or twice a year, and since I cannot go to see them in Europe this summer, they want to come here instead (they are both Canadian but are working abroad), and they have a house, but about an hour and a half away from where I live. The problem is that my parents want to come stay at our place for about a week, because my mom says she wants to see me (which means she wants to spend every minute of each day they’re here with me) and doesn’t want to be at the family house because it’s far and I don’t have a car or license to go, plus I work. However, I know this would bother my girlfriend, because one of my best friends is coming for a week next month and staying at our place and she wasn’t too enthusiastic about it. I understand her point of view because she has to work 6 days a week at a stressful job and wants to be able to just relax and do her thing when she comes home, and having your boyfriend’s parents over for that long is a bit stressful too on top of that. I have tried to express this to my parents, and they replied by saying that it’s “our” (mine and my parents’) place too because we pay for half of the rent, and I could see my mom getting visibly annoyed... She even finished our conversation by asking my if I still love her as much as I did when we first started dating..... I really don’t know how to handle the situation because I understand that my girlfriend wants her own place to be able to relax in, and don’t want to stress her, but I also understand my parents want to spend time with me and I want to see them too. I feel like I’m in the middle of this situation, and I haven’t even spoken to my girlfriend about this yet because I don’t want to stress her out (she gets stressed super easily). Any advice?"
4506,d6h5kt,powlou,My slightly autistic friend is feeling suicidal. How can i help him? Any advice?,"So my teenage friend (16 years old) has been struggling with bullies since back in 4th grade. I knew him then but I had other struggles (like finally doing 100% in lego star wars) and I didn’t really give him much attention. I started getting to know him 4 years ago, in 7th grade. We got to go to the same school and since he’s basically my neighbor (10 houses away) we started going to school together. I realized how nice he actually is and how special of a person he is. We didn’t really know eachother well but only 1 month after getting to know eachother, he even gave me a birthday present, which I really didn’t expect because even my best friend didn’t give me one. The years went on and we kinda fell out of contact. Last year tho, in 9th grade, we started talking again. We had a special moment together, we hung out at night and talked about the universe and how big it was and stuff that we didn’t even understand. We became really good friends. After 9th grade we had to change schools again. We landed in the same school, again. We’re driving there everyday and it’s cool. 

He’s really difficult too though.
Some months ago he told me that he had slight autism. I kinda expected it, because tbh, he kinda acts weird in some situations. Like e.g. when I try to give him a bro-fist, he usually twitches, like he’d expect me to punch him. I’ve never hit him in my life. He sees the world differently. Things that we see as a friendly gesture, he may see as a personal attack. He’s a super smart person too, but since he has a lot of trouble socializing, he gives his complete free time up to trying to make new friends per instagram or snapchat etc., instead of studying. He gets bullied in his new class. About a month ago he told me he’s suicidal. It was a shock for me. I tried to hug him, he twitched and from an outside watcher it may have seemed weird but it was a beautiful moment.

He often gets angry at me and I often get angry at him. Today e.g. I had to wait for him for 15min and I came late to class and I was pissed at him the whole day, using his debility of being an outsider, and ignoring him the whole day. He doesn’t deserve that. Another time we were driving back from school on our bikes. We had a little argument before, because he didn’t look out for other cars. I told him he could’ve got himself killed and he yelled at me for the rest of the home way. I stopped on a red light and he yelled at me that we are bikers, we don’t have to stop on red lights. I may have got a little bit too angry there about how stupid that thing was he just said and called him retarded. We apologized to eachother the following evening and the next day we acted like nothing had happened.

I want to help him. But how? I really don’t want to lose him as a friend. This world needs more people like him."
22801,9fzila,Jake_s_5,I’m scared to sleep,"So I’m a college student, I live in a suite style dorm with my older brother and these two other guys who are twins.

I’ve never had any serious issues with my diabetes, I take pretty good care of myself. My brother also takes good care of himself. On Thursday night I was having a strange dream and I was hearing this thumping noise, when I woke up the thumping noise hadn’t stopped. I looked over at my brothers bed and he was having a seizure. My brother was spazzing out in his bed. I immediately sprinted out of my room and woke my other roommates up and then sprinted back to my brother to take care of him. His body was soaked in sweat, his eyes were wide open but he was just staring off into nothing. After getting him to stop spazzing, testing his blood sugar, and getting him to drink some Red Bull he quit responding completely. I grabbed my emergency glucagon shot and got it ready to to inject him. As soon as I was about to give him the shot he regained his ability to sit up and speak a little. It didn’t process in my mind that if I hadn’t woken up when I did that he would be dead until later in the day. But now I can’t sleep. I close my eyes and all I do is hear the thumping noise in my head and it gives me anxiety that if I go to sleep he might die, or I might. I can’t sleep and it’s scaring me."

Feeling disconnected,"I recently moved to one of the largest cities in the US About a year ago, and while I’ve enjoyed it so far, I feel like I’ve really lost my softness over the last few months. I like to think of myself as more down to earth and easy going. I cry happy tears when I see a puppy, I give to homeless. I’m the first person people go to for advice or need an ear to listen. I have always been very empathetic and “emotional” and though I did struggle with that, I’ve grown to accept it and I started to like those soft qualities of myself. Within the last 2 months or so though, I feel like I’ve lost that part of myself. I’m not phased by the sight of homeless people as much, I feel like I’ve become more materialistic. I find it harder to give advice and care. I feel like I’m losing touch with myself. I’m not sure if this is because I’m so emerged in the “dog eat dog environment” or if it’s other factors I’m facing (i.e. my best friend died 3 months ago) and if this is a side effect (because it has been so hard to try and overcome) of it. I feel it may be a combination, but regardless: advice on getting back in touch with what makes you, you? I feel so disconnected with myself and others anymore. 

TL;DR - feel like I’m losing the soft and emotional parts of me from “big city living” wear and tear - how do I get back in touch with those parts of myself?"

12424,c1gbzv,PeppermintToad,Should I cut my mom out of my life in support of my dad and sister?,"My mom had an affair with my dad's nephew. (Starting off with a bang.....no pun intended.) That was about 3 years ago now. My mom was always a stay at home mom. Got everything she wanted (make up, clothes, cars, etc). Once all the kids grew up she started to have, what seems to be, a never ending midlife crisis. Starting talking to the nephew and had a full on affair for about 15 months. My dad found out and things were rough, obviously. They tried to make it work, but ultimately ended up getting a divorce last October. (The nephew decided to work things out with his wife....shocking.)

My mom works at a grocery store now. Her first job in nearly 30 years. She ended up somehow getting $500 a month paid to her from my dad for alimony. He has to pay this for the next 7 years. 

She choose to move closer to her sister, and further away from her kids. Her sister was always on her side and she thought we shouldn't have been upset about everything because it's ""not our business."" She moved into a luxury apartment. Her apartment was less than 1,000 sqft and she paid over a 1,000 a month for it with the help of my dad. She bought a used 2016 Kia forte in cash for like 13,000. Money she got from her parent's death. (She doesn't have that money anymore. Spent it within a year). She bought A LOT of new things for her apartment. Like a painting of a cat drinking wine that was over $100. Bottom line....the lady can spend money. 

Now she lives in a very nice condo that she bought. She pays over 1100 a month for it. She moved in that place because that is where her sister lives also. They are in walking distance apart from each other. The only reason she can afford it, is because my dad money pays for nearly half of her mortgage.

In the divorce agreement, she gave my dad a year to refinance the house they own in his name or they will have to sell it and split the profit, if there is any. My dad has been working under the table for quite some time now. She profited off of that fact for a while too. As of the beginning of this year he is working on the books. But it doesn't seem like he will be able to refinance the house in his name. Because of this, he asked her if he and my younger brother, who lives with him, could stay there and pay the mortgage off until he dies and then the house will be solely hers to do with what she pleases. She said no. She wants to sell it and get money now. 

My sister contacted her to ask her why she won't work with our dad and why she is being so cold and greedy. That turned into a nasty argument and they are not speaking. Long time coming really. My mom never makes time for any of us or our kids, but it seems to upset my sister and her kids a lot more than anyone else. 

My mom called my dad a bunch of names and said a lot of mean and untrue stuff to my sister and about her. She said the only reason she wants to sell the house is because she ""deserves to have money in her savings."" Which she could have had if she didn't live so lavishly. 

So, now I'm not sure what I should do. Technically, I was not involved in any of this. I am trying to work with my dad now on finding a way for us to keep the house. He only has 10 years left to pay it off and its our family home. I feel like it would be wrong to see it go, just so she can have even more money. I am very close with my sister, dad, and brother now and a big part of me feels like I should cut her off in support of them and because I agree that she is being very greedy and selfish. But I'm not sure if i should even get involved. 

I don't feel like I really have a mom anymore anyways. She wants to act like a 25 year old....she doesn't want to act like a mom or grandma. My daughter asks about her though. 

So, should I tell her to fuck off with her money? Or still go to her occasional dinners, listen to her talk about herself, spoil my daughter too much, just so i can say i have somewhat of a relationship with my mother?"

12853,bz8jf4,whataboutit34,I’ve lost my appetite for any food.,"I’ve always loved food since I was little I mean who doesn’t love food. But something happened in my teen years that just made me slowly lose interest in any food... I got severe depression because my parents were/still are narcissistic parents. They’re very controlling. So around when I was 15-16 things started getting bad with my mental health, when I was 17 my parents divorced and it didn’t do much damage to me because I knew for a long time since I was 10 that they didn’t love eachother. But when they divorced us when my weight started dropping because I got braces and couldn’t eat anything I used to, also I lived with my dad who was traveling most of the time for work. He and my mom used to make extravagant meals for me and my siblings and once she was out of the house my dad stopped making those meals. There would be a month where all he would cook is chicken. Just plain chicken for dinner and he’d make it Mexican style, I don’t like Mexican food or the smell of it. So I would just eat whatever was in the pantry and there would be nights where I just wouldn’t eat because there was no food or I was stressed out. I don’t know what changed but when I was sad before I would eat a lot and now when I’m sad I don’t eat. 

I moved into my grandparents house when I was 18 I only lived there for 3 months but they basically forced me to eat a lot of food. I wasn’t anorexic and idk if I am right now but we’ll get to that later in the post. So I wasn’t anorexic or had any eating disorders but all of my family thought I was. So they watched what I ate, made sure I ate 3 meals a day and at dinner made me eat a lot. I was in a very bad place at the time and the stress was so bad I didn’t want to eat so my stomach was in pain constantly, I was bloated everyday, it wasn’t good. When I moved out of my house I’m currently at my boyfriends house now with his parents. I’m very lucky that they have offered me to live here rent free and pay for my food they buy. But their eating habits are COMPLETELY different than mine like out of the ball park on taste buds. So I feel like I’m at the same situation at my dads, there’s no food I want. I could go out and grocery shop yes but the problem is they kinda hoard everything. There’s no room in any of the cabinets like there’s canned food falling out, snacks falling out, in the fridge is stocked with old food and beer. There’s just no room for me to put my stuff. I also don’t want to be rude with their food and throw it away because they paid for it and I don’t know if they’re going to eat it. 

And recently I’ve just absolutely lost my interest in food, like I eat to survive now. And if I’m stressed I don’t eat which I’m stressed all the time. I don’t know how to get my mojo back with food and it’s concerning me because I’m not getting any of the nutrition I need right now. This family doesn’t buy fruit or vegetables and if they do they get upset because of how much it costs and they also won’t eat it. I think the only vegetables they eat are canned cream of mushrooms... I’m concerned because I don’t want to lose interest in food, I want to expand my taste buds with stuff I like and that is healthy, and I’m only eating to survive right now which is not me, and my health is at risk because of my weight which is 99 pounds, and I’m 5’5 in height. I think my doctor said my BMI level is very below average right now. How do I even get to enjoy food? Does it sound like I have a eating problem?"
10236,ccpye2,pandabear4991,SO and I fought and it might be over.,"SO and I just had a huge fight over not telling him about my job interview that happened yesterday. Only reason why I didn't tell him about it was because of my insecurity of failing the interview and him knowing I failed. He said it hurts and can't grasp WHY I never told him about it. We argued for about 3 hours over face time and said he didn't want to be with me anymore and my actions were questionable saying I shouldn't be insecure and have my shit together which really hurt a lot. He said he didn't want no lies and don't have time for that BS buuuut I have always been honest with him - about my family, my alcoholic days, even my body issues. It was just that at that time I was so scared and anxious I'm afraid of what he's going to say. It got me. I was so overwhelmed. 

That's my very first EVER job interview btw. 

He said how can I be trusted again after lying to him about my job interview because that's the basis for a relationship. No lies, no BS. I told him that trust is a process and I learn from my mistakes. He didn't want to accept my apology and didn't want to be with me again. I'm so sad, honestly. ☹ I need a beer.

I live in LA after graduating a year ago. I’ve been having back to back major setbacks and on the verge of moving home with no plans. As of right now, I just got on crutches, bank’s dry, and just got rejected today for a job that actually would’ve saved my life. And I can’t keep working part time shifts bc it’s unsustainable here and I might as well go home. A lot of unpredictable circumstances arose and for one reason or another, my plans/goals kept  drastically changing to the point that I have no idea what direction in life I’m even walking.. The end of college was like an aggressive shove, and I’ve been tumbling ever since without getting solid footing. Now that I think about it, I’m pretty shocked I even managed to graduate... I wanted to go to grad school but I couldn’t afford it. And I took a big Hail Mary gamble investing a lot of time to land that job (and I was pretty certain I would get it). I’m pretty depressed but holding it together because I learned how to from counseling during a prior depressive episode. I feel so emotionally, mentally, (and technically) physically crippled that I’m doing less and less of things I enjoy and can barely eat...

I WANT to get back on the road I planned to be on. Further my education. Get a good job. And find some way to contribute back into society. But now I’m just stuck at rock bottom. And someone though it was ok to drop another rock lol. So yea any advice?

Fast forward 3 months later. It comes up, so I show my mom. It's fine. I come back from work and she is crying. She said it's super embarrassing. That it reminds her of her gay co-worker. 

So I'm like, ""are you just being homophobic? So what if someone thinks I'm gay or whatnot"". 

She said it's not that. But that how do I expect other people to take me seriously with a picture like that. That people are laughing at me. That I'm making a joke out of myself. How do I expect to find a girlfriend that will take me seriously? She's super worried about other people seeing it. Like her friends and our family. Or how it will affect me trying to get a job. 

But I'm over here like. ""It's just a joke"". 

I love my mom. She's taking this really deeply. And Idk whether she's being irrational or homophobic, or whether she's right.

I recently got promoted at work, and since then I've been on edge, anxious, tense/stressed. It's been this way for the past two weeks.
Now I figure it's because of this huge change in my life and I'll eventually adapt.
However, last night at 3 in the morning I woke up from a nightmare. I was trembling, my heartrate was increased and it felt like a good 20 minutes before I calmed down. I guess the thing that scared me most is how long it took for me to calm down and say ""that's not scientifically possible"" (my nightmare was about zombies). And I think what prolonged my panic attack was the fear that what if one day I can't differentiate between real and imaginary.
I guess I'm looking for advice on how to cope, this is the first time I've ever had a nightmare/panic attack in my sleep.
I try to practice mindfulness as much as I can, exercise, healthy eating, meditation, breathing exercises and listening to calming nature sounds.
But I'm still pretty shaken up about the whole experience. "
16683,bgttkf,throwawayForMyCousin,"My cousin took MDMA 6 months ago, now she's lost 20 pounds, she says her former self is dead and that nothing except her spiritual advancement matters, and she wants nothing in life except to take drugs to advance toward this goal","Hey all. Gotta start with a disclaimer: This story totally sounds like dumb DARE propaganda ""drug are bad Mkay?"", but that's not what I'm going for, I'm actually for common sense legalization of most stuff. I realize that the vast majority of drug users don't do like my cousin.

So, I've got two cousins, A and B. A's the older one, B's younger. A has always been the quiet overachiever, while B was the flamboyant extrovert. Our family is mostly made up of the former, so she might have always felt that she played second fiddle to her sister. She started her puberty by getting a bit rebellious, and has just been getting moreso since then. Nothing crazy though, just like partying a lot, failing her classes, normal doesn't-like-school teenager stuff.

Around 15-16 years old B started dealing with eating disorders, as many girls do sadly. Her weight bounced around pretty significantly.

So, to get to the point of the story, 6 months ago (she's 17 now) she took MDMA for the first time. I honestly thought MDMA was pretty chill as far as psychoactives go, I know a few people who took it without changing their whole paradigm, but it seems like it had a big impact on her.

According to her version of the story, she took MDMA, and the person that was occupying her body was progressively killed off and replaced by the person she is now (that was a bit upsetting, given I quite liked this person). That previous person, the one that we know was childish and stuck in the physical, whereas this new person operates on a higher level. She *knows* the future, and *knows* people when she sees them. Knows in a spiritual sense, as in she knows their personality and how they work.

She also said ""Existentialism is a humanism"" a bunch of times like it was the deepest thing, even though Sartre is highschool philosophy at its finest.

Anytime you try to speak to her about anything except spiritualism, she tells you that your hobbies, your actions, your life, your past, and your future don't matter, that giving them value is just a thing society taught us, and that she doesn't assign any of those things any value. She says food has lost its attractiveness and she's lost about 20 pounds, and she's the thinnest she's ever been.

She also only sits in her bed smoking weed all day unless she's visiting her friends to take harder drugs, and she doesn't express any interest in doing anything else ever.

This is a biproduct of the above, but she's also very patronizing and abrasive to everyone.

She talked about her friends overdosing on harder psychoactives with some admiration, which is a bit worrisome.

She's also had that popular queen bee, manipulative side to her, so I'm kinda suspicious that the whole thing might be a machination to get to sit at her parent's house rent-free without being pressured to do anything except getting high.

Basically, I have no idea how to help, if I should help, or of what's going through her mind. I'm a nerdy straight-A engineer with few friends, and I've smoked weed like four times, so I'm entirely out of my comfort zone.

Any advice for me, reddit?"

26233,8ylx7y,Kloeysixx,I got screwed over with a loan,"Okay so I want to give a back story for this. I'm 22, and when I was in 7th grade I became good friends with this girl. Fast forward to 2015, we talk once in a blue moon but I mean I trusted her, didn't have any issues. She comes to me and asks me for help bc she ended up pregnant, and her now ex boyfriend left her and cleared out their joined bank account, and stopped paying her car payments so her car got repossessed. She asked me for help with a Payday loan and I agreed since she has never never sketchy with me. So it turns out she never pays the loan and I work until it's paid off. I was pissed she never answered my texts or messages and months later she tells me all kinds of stuff happened with her family and she kept pawning off her phone and she couldn't answer. So I forgive and just wait on her to pay me back and chill out since life happens.

So this is the mistake i made, about a year later I finally have a decent job, I move in with my boyfriend and Im happy, my life had improved. She then finally tells me that she has a.nea job and she can start paying me back and wants to give me more money for making me wait so long. Of course I'm excited and think I can save to go back to school. Then she asks me for help with another Payday loan. Then of course I say no that she hasn't paid me back, and she tells me she's starting a new job and it's guaranteed shes going to be getting paid the week after. My idiot self decides to help her because she tells me she and her family are living in hotel and can't afford anywhere to live and that they need help with buying food and living costs, and I help them. Before I get any ""you should have known they're taking advantage"" (which I deserve) her dad comes in the situation and promises he's going to help pay me back with tax money and his paychecks, so I agree. A few months later they caused my 2 bank accounts to be over drawn, and now my credit is unbelievably ruined, I can't have a bank account, and I'm literally in debt over 6,000$ and some of the loans have interest being added, and it's been 3 years and there's no way I can pay it back. Everytime I ask her about paying it back there's always an excuse. I geelentally exhausted over the situation. My boyfriend and I were looking forward to getting our life started and moving out of state to be able to start over and now I can't even fix my credit to be able to help apply for appartments or anything. And my brother has tried helping me out with getting a bank account and they all say he can't add me on as an authorized user because I'm on the equifax report. I literally don't know what to do. 

I feel stuck because regardless, I signed the papers for the loans so I am repsonsible for them getting paid, and I can't help but think that they're probably doing this to other people. My family can't help me because it's just too much for anyone to help me pay back. 😔"

So I need some advice. I met this guy in a class in the second semester of 9th grade (2012) and we fell out of contact for a while and we reconnected in 2015. We were friends for a while, but I quickly things weren't exactly working out between us, simply because we didn't connect and he kind of creeped me out. I didn't really want to tell him that because I didn't want to seem rude or anything, so I just sort of made our communications less frequent and eventually not at all. Eventually, in early 2016, I found a blog post he had written about me from while we were still friends and it mentioned him wanting to use me to get him a PlayStation 4. However, the way he phrased it made me unsure if he was being sarcastic or if he was serious. Seeing that as my 'out' for our friendship, I emailed him a fabricated/embellished email just to end things. I have felt guilty about it ever since. He never wrote back to it. Two and a half years have gone by, and I feel like I should issue an apology for it, regardless of whether or not he meant to use me. What do you think I should do? I live very close to him and run the risk of bumping into him, so I am worried he thinks I'm crazy after my BS email...I don't know how he took it.

This scooter dude came out of nowhere and narrowly missed bumping into me. He said something like ""wtf you doing"". In my mind i thought i wasn't at fault and he was since 1) he wasn't wearing a helmet 2) he was speeding and came out of nowhere.

I said nothing happened, dude go on in a stern voice. This guy gets out of his scooter and walks up to my door. Fearing some sort of altercation i got out of my car as well. He hit me out of nowhere and i got shocked. I was really shocked that i was in a street brawl. He looked tougher than me as well. I did hit him a bit but now i don't remember if i hit hard enough. He hurled in some abuses as well and hit again. I was constantly shouting dude wtf nothing happened then why you doing this shit. Finally one middle aged woman came and said why you hitting in the middle of the road, there are cars behind, stop it. He finally acquiesced and went off. I was so shocked that i didn't have the sense to note down his number plate while he drove away.

I am so mentally broken man. Never thought i would be involved in something like this. I feel I should i have hit him back. His punches don't hurt me as much as the whole scene that occurred. No blood no bruises but just this shock and utter helplessness.

The worst feeling is that I know I'm not at fault but still had to be beaten up. I had to tell him, ""its my fault, I'm accepting my mistake, i didn't hit your scooter, why you doing this?"" - all this, just to stop him.

This guy was a early 30s 6' dad bod ruffian. I'm 23 year old 5'9'' and a skinny fat fellow. I feel like i can't survive in the real world if this is the kind of reactions i give in situations.

My dad and younger brother are both 6' and above and i had a small thing about my genetics being bad but now i feel its the worst thing being a **baby faced skinny fat** guy.

3890,d9c7sm,hitori_arukishiteru,How to cope with angry father?,"I don't have any friends, nor do I have any relatives.  I am a twenty-year old woman currently in community college.  

My father tends to go into a rage. It has always made me scared, uncomfortable, and even suicidal due to the things he says or does during said rages. Sometimes he threatens to hit me when he thinks I'm being disobedient, awful (as in being a bad daughter) or stupid (which is often, given that I am rather slow), though he hasn't struck me in many years. Even if his anger isn't directed at me, I still feel on edge. 

I know I'm to blame for this. I'm an adult now. There's no excuse. I actually did try to move away when I was younger, but every job I've had, I've run away from due to how often I would make mistakes. These were minimum wage jobs. 

A psychiatrist I had suggested I go on disability. I have been officially diagnosed with several disorders. However, I'm not sure how to go about the process, especially since I am no longer in contact with him. Also, I've heard it takes years for people to get accepted. 

I apologize if this post was confusing."
5828,cz4clw,Atocz,I (24M) struggle maintaining friendships and am constantly ghosted,"This has been an ongoing issue for several years. I had no friends, and decided to meet new people, and even after I thought we had fun, eventually I’d get ghosted. I tried really hard at initiating, pushing through my anxiety as I just really wanted a social circle, but I kept getting ghosted. 

It got to the point where I’d keep meeting new people, know them for less than a week, and then get ghosted. I went through about 50~ people before I gave up and did not talk to anyone for a whole year.

Eventually I tried again and it was the same result, eventually I gave up again and just figured I’m better off alone.

Well now I am trying once again and this will be my last time before I give up trying completely. I don’t feel like I say or do anything wrong, I just be myself and it’s not really worth pretending to change that. 

I feel extremely isolated and disconnected from the entire world because everyone just leaves. What should I do?"

I’m only freshly 20 so I can’t go out to certain places which really seems to limit some possible options. I like to think I’m not weird and I had plenty of friends where I came from. I have a job and enjoy the people there but not really as outside friends. I’ve looked at the meetup app and it’s mostly for older folks. I’m also not in college, I’ll be attending a software engineer school for a year in September. 

I know it sounds like a bunch of excuses but I’m really just looking to see if anyone has any ideas of places to meet people that I might have overlooked. 

Thanks guys!"

19549,b0vh0h,parched_boi,i make my boyfriend (m22) very uncomfortable by smoking weed &amp; i have no idea what to do,"lemme start by saying that i smoke weed purely for my anxiety. ive tried a few medications when i was younger but ive found that they dont work as good as weed. i smoke it legally where i live, and it is prescription. 
me &amp; my boyfriend live together in an apartment, whenever i smoke i make sure i do it outside on the porch or ill go out for a walk and do it there. whenever i get home i notice that my boyfriend is distant and he isn't as cheerful as he once was. ive tried to speak to him about the issue but it's always ended with him saying. ""you know how i feel about drugs."" then the topic is dropped completely
on sunday we finally really spoke about it. he told me that he wanted nothing to do with drugs, and whenever i came home smelling like weed it made his head hurt (which is something i never knew), but he tells me that it's fine but he obviously didn't feel that way.
so on monday i stopped smoking, and it really shows. ive been so anxious, like ill wake up in the middle of night because i here my dog get up or ill spend the entire day just pacing and stressing out about notebook paper (not kidding). today it hit its peek when i had a panic attack over not being able to find my dog.
my boyfriend semi yelled at me for not smoking, but i can tell it makes him very uncomfortable when i do it and i dont know what to do. 
what should i do? (sorry if this was jumbled and what not, my first language isn't english &amp; im on mobile)"

31067,8bf9bd,ann14a,i’m a crybaby,"hi! i’m a fourteen year old girl that recently moved out of a country i’ve been born and raised in. And i’ve been facing some troubles.

I’m from the middle east but was born and raised in a beautiful country called Malaysia! I was used to being surrounded by loads of middle easterners that migrated there and malaysians themselves. I had no problem figuring in and growing up there, i knew the malaysian jokes my friends would tell and i would answer back because heck! that’s the type of environment i’m used to.

My dad found a new job in Australia, yes , the country that has all types of spiders and has kangaroos roaming around everywhere supposedly. I’ve been enrolled to a new school and let me tell you, this is not what i expected.

I thought they lived up to their profile of ‘We’re a diverse school!’. But i can surely tell you that i am the only asian in my year. Normally i wouldn’t have minded, its a new environment and i shouldn’t complain to much, but a week in and they don’t really treat me like ‘one of them’.

i take a bus to and from school, and whenever i sit down somewhere people avoid sitting next to me, even when the whole bus is full they’d rather stand. When a class has an assigned seat, people wouldn’t look so happy when the teacher tells me to sit next to them, and when i’m new to a class and choose a seat out of random people would groan and sigh to see that i’ve sat down on where they usually sit. I would pack up my stuff to offer it back to them but they just ignore me and sit somewhere else, also coming down to me sitting alone in a table for four. Usually i don’t read into these things, but one thing that really got me was when a teacher came up to me, asking me to talk to them.

She pulled me aside and asked me how i thought about the school, if the classes were enjoyable and if the students were nice. I replied and said that classes were fun, students were nice and i was pleased with the surroundings. Then she asked me if i had anyone to talk to and sit next to during recess and lunch. I replied no, saying i read a book and sit on bench while eating my bread and that i don’t mind. She frowned at me and said ‘Do you want me to assign someone to you?’ and that felt like a pang to me.

Was my actions pitiful? Me sitting alone during lunch and reading a book is not ideal? A teacher had to assign a person to me because i’m too much of a introvert to make one myself?

I read so much into this and eventually came home crying about this. I didn’t want to tell my parents because we’re still on tough circumstances and i didn’t want to add fuel to the fire. But of course, no matter what you can’t hide anything from your own parents. My dad came into the room and talked to me about this, advising me to skip tomorrow and collect my thoughts. A teacher called and said for me to visit them tomorrow in their office to -for what i’m guessing-  talk about this issue.

Any advice? If there isn’t anything regarding to the school, maybe tell me how to block out my emotions and keep going?

Thank you 💕"
23338,9dgk1a,-I_Am_The_GOAT-,I got scammed like the naive piece of shit I am.,"Basically, guys from my schools (from a school which everyones now left from last year) Posted on snap posted ""easy money to be made just need a contract phone number."" So as the curious person I was I messaged him. He just explained it as if it was a bug in this website and they can get bitcoin and transfer it into money. I was sceptical. I talked to someone who ""had done it"" and he said it was cool. This guy has tons of money as a teenagers so I figured fuck it this should work.

&amp;#x200B;

I did it, I got a text charging me £27 and I was like yeah charge me (knowing it would charge my mum rather then me) . Being the 17 year old naive person I am, He messaged me back for the first couple days and says the money is coming. Then after those days he completely ignores me and this is when I realised how he has so much money. its one thing to scam strangers and another to scam people you knew. I got scammed through a website called ""Boku"" Which charges your phone for shit and I didn't even do research on them before I got charged. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mum found out, I just told her I bought a bunch of stuff online and that I'd give her the money, but my real aim is to get my money back and just never associate myself again, im cool with some of his friends but I dont think they're gonna really help me out, somehow I got charged £40, but yeah. any advice? I never been on this sub reddit so I thought I'd give it ago."

38712,7lxa3s,rooms966,Relationship issues,"Before I get started, just wanna clarify that my friend was kind enough to let me use his reddit to ask this question as I don't have one but I really need help so if I get back to you a little late, please don't feel like your advice doesn't matter to me because it does.
So here's the thing, I got into a relationship with this guy who was calm, tolerant, mature etc last year. I am 21 and he is 31...He was a very calm person last year and would respect people of different race however, he had some problems and now he has turned into a racist person with extreme anger issues with extremely low tolerance. 
If I just happened to be standing in his way, for example, I am standing next to the tv and he has to walk past me, he gets so angry and is like moovvee!!! Also he is a fast driver so when we go out and some car is in front of him, he gets so angry and screams ""MOVE YOU FUCKING MORON!"" even though some of them are on the actual speed limit.
If we go somewhere, lets say a pizza hut in a mall, and the person taking out order tells him oh sorry we don't have that particular thing, he gets so annoyed at the person and makes angry faces at them. Like come on! Its not their fault that they don't have it wtf! they are just responsible for taking orders.. and he flips out on them by saying ""YOU DONT EVEN HAVE THE BASICS!"" and just walks away. Similarly, this one time we went to a bar and he asked the person working there if they have live music and the guy was like no we don't have them here and then my boyfriend was like ""You do last time I came u had them here"" and the guy was like idk sir but we don't have them. And my boyfriend got annoyed and said ""So you don't have them today?"" and he replied ""No"" and my boyfriend just stormed out of the bar. When I talked to him about this he said ""He was making me out as a dumb person. I have been there before I know they have it and he was like no! I felt like saying to him I am probably more educated than you""
This is not true. The guy at the bar probably was new and was told that they have no live music nights there. There is no reason to flip out on someone like that. This is also why I am scared of introducing him to my friends at times, because he has zero tolerance and may end up saying some shit.
what really upset me was when he flipped out on my dad a little. Family is important to me. I would never even think about being horrible to his mom.
This one time he came to stay with my parents for three days. His flight back was at 9 am but my father thought it was 5 am and he insisted to drop him off at the airport, my dad thought it was 7 am so he came and woke him up at 5:30 am and instead of just telling him nicely that he has time, he just said in an anger tone ""Its 5 am! What are you doing I am going back to sleep!"" and that really pissed me off and made me sad. Even though I didn't talk to him about it. 
I have no problem with him flipping out on people who are rude to him but he does it to people aren't clear with their message. Like we like in a foreign country, people speak a different language here so its understandable if sometimes they struggle to explain something in English.. And if he isn't able to understand them he flips out.. Instead of just saying ""Sorry, come again?"" 
The good things about him is that he is willing to always be there for me and if I have any issue, he would call me up and talk with me about it for hours. I am a student so sometimes I cant really afford going to places with him but he pays for me always and never lets me spend anything on him. Since I recently moved out, I am still learning stuff like ironing and washing. But when I go to meet him, he always tells me to hand in my clothes and he would do it for me. He even makes food for me whenever I come to visit and if I have any issue at all with university or anything. he is always there to help me out.  "

608,dque6d,throwaway_100000001,Is my friendship with my best friend doomed or should I try again to reach out?,"This is a bit of a long story so I will get to the nitty gritty of my dilemma as best as possible. Thank you in advance for reading. 

I [28F] was best friends with [28F] whom I will call Melanie for around 7 years. I considered her to be more like a sister than a best friend, considering she lived with my family and I (rented the downstairs from my mom and dad) for 4 of those years, and worked together for 4.5. In all of those years, we’ve never gotten into any very serious fights, but there were some difference that we were able to talk out. I had never experienced that kind of closeness, joy, laughter, loyalty, secrets, pain, tears with any other friend in my life. 

Now, a bit of a backstory on me. I’ve been dealing with serious anxiety, PTSD and depression for years. I am currently seeing a doctor and therapist and working hard on myself and taking responsibility for my recovery. Back in April on my boyfriend’s birthday, I was having a very bad day mentally and was not able to get myself to go out to his group birthday dinner. My boyfriend was very sweet and understanding about it and we decided to celebrate on our own on another day. I felt very guilty about it so I decided to reach out to Melanie, who responded with things like “I get tired too sometimes, but I show up for events like this…if you really love him you’d go..” I got really upset at these comments and said “you don't seem to understand so let’s just drop it.”

I was really upset that she reacted this way because I didn't skip the birthday dinner because I don't love my boyfriend or was feeling lazy, I truly felt horrible about not being able to go that day. And thats where mental illness can be terribly inconvenient and bad days strike at the worst times. But I try my 100% hardest to be available and present for my loved ones and thats why my boyfriend was very understanding that day.

Now, this is where I messed up. I took the comments very much to heart and I was too busy tending to what I was feeling at the time to address it and tell her how much it hurt me. I should’ve told her I was angry. And so 3 weeks went by and neither one of us had spoken until her graduation day. There was the ceremony and a surprise dinner I RSVPed too that her mom threw her for afterwards.

I didn't have any details about the ceremony, and she hadn't reached out to see if I was coming either. So I decided that I will at least go to the party instead. My boyfriend and I show up to the party early, with only two people there since the ceremony ended up running late with traffic and all that. So we left to go wait in the car. While waiting I was scrolling on instagram and saw friends posting her at the ceremony and it just broke my heart that I wasn't there. I’d been by her side through the blood sweat and tears cheering her on and supporting her throughout the process. I ended up feeling so crappy I didn't go back to the party that night. I know I should have but it was a small room where I couldn't have just shown up for a little and snuck out. And plus at this point, I’d been crying and my makeup was ruined and down my face.

Once the anger from her comments died down, I started to grieve her absence. In July, 3 months after the birthday text incident, I decided to write her a long well thought out message. I explained why what she said hurt me, I explained how terribly sorry I was for not going to the ceremony and party and how proud I am of her and how much I cherished our friendship. I spent a lot of time writing it and putting my heart into it. 

It took a lot of guts to send the message in the first place and took me a few days. I know she started a new job working night shifts so I waited patiently for two weeks. It was nerve wracking to wait but I told myself she was busy and needed time to reply and think about it. However, on instagram I saw she was going out with friends and on road trips etc. so I knew she had some free time to reply. And after two weeks of waiting I followed up with a message, of something a long the lines of “if you don't want to be friends anymore, I understand. I just wish we could've had a discussion and you would've let me know instead of keeping me hanging” 

Still no response for days. At this point, I decided to just block her on social media and her phone number (but only for a day and then I unblocked it, I was angry and grieving and acting on that). Now in this time she replied but the message only got to my Macbook. She replied with something along the lines of how she is stressed at work, has read my message many times over, of course she isn’t mad anymore, things happen between friends. 

I didn't see this message for two weeks since I don't check iMessage often, but I wrote back I am really sorry I didn't reply sooner, that I blocked her out of anger and thats why I didn't see the message and that I’m sorry she is really stressed with work, etc. 

This was at the end of July and I got no reply back. It was tough for me after pouring my heart out in the initial message I sent her to not hear back. I have always dropped everything for her and she has done so much for me also. She is a big social butterfly with a ton of friends and I am still going through a lot and don’t really have as many close friends due to people working crazy hours, having kids, moving, their own depression issues etc. I truly loved her like a sister but I don't know if its right to reach out to her again considering she didn't seem to put much effort back into reconciling our friendship. In addition, I’ve seen her drop very close people to her and not seem to care much. It hurts to think I would be one of them. Should I let go or give it one last try to fix our friendship? Are we doomed? What do I do reddit?"

35449,7wnbud,vklbxgles,Threatening behaviour from my mother,"My mother (who lives on her own) has become difficult to deal with over the past few years. Recently, she has started to create arguments over trivial issues. When I don’t give in or accept her point of view, she will scream, shout, threaten suicide, lie about having cancer, threaten to ring my work to try ruin my career, and generally be abusive. This has happened multiple times before and I can’t deal with it anymore.  

Here are a few recent quotes:

“Ok if you won't answer I bloody well will phone your work on Monday. Your choice”
“I will never forgive you”
“I'm going to do something dreadful........”
“I hold you totally responsible for what's going to happen next”
“If you don't answer - I will phone you at work.”
“So upset this time - want to die. Goodbye”

Girl a has sleeping problems and takes sleeping meds that make her drowsy and impair her judgement. She usually fights through the drowsiness; past a certain point of staying up she won't have memory of it. Everyone knows that she's on sleeping meds. Something to be noted is that girl a has absolutely no interest in him.

I only know of this situation because guy a came out with it a week after. Over the summer guy a decides to get handsy one night. We're all watching a movie and we're under a blanket together. Even though it was over clothes he says he did some stuff, like rub her etc. Now, girl a has absolutely no idea any of this happened. The group of people that he decided to tell a week later, which was two other people, decided not to tell her. There are no effects of what he did, nobody is ever talking about it again because well, they forgot. He's also scared of what it would do to his rep (or he was at the time) so he won't say anything.

Do I tell her now? It's half a year later.

The way I see it is if I tell her she only loses. She'll more than likely be devastated, but if I don't tell her life goes on as normal. She has no recollection, no effects, and nobody is bringing it up again. Thanks."

I’ve been to therapy since I was in third grade and am medicated for anxiety and depression. I was very hurt and offended by what my mom said and changed my whole perspective of her. Am I overreacting? Should I confront her about it? Is it immature to want to separate myself more from my mother after this? "
37566,7pb5ng,Hash43,My roommate/landlord wants me to pitch in for the electrical bill this month because it jumped by $200 with no explanation. My rental agreement is that everything is included in my rent. Would it be rude if I refused to pitch in?,"So I live with a couple. The girl is 24 and the owner of the house. I used to work with her before we became roommates so I know her pretty well and we get along pretty well and sometimes her and my other roommate and her friends go out for drinks so we have a decent roommate relationship. The average electricity bill for her is usually around $100 a month but she said last month it was $320. No one is sure why (maybe christmas tree lights). Anyway, her bf / my other roommate warned me that she is going to ask me to pitch in a bit extra this month because of it.

I was leaning to wards saying no as my lease agreement points out that power/water/heat is all included in my rent, but since I live with them and she can be a bit of a drama queen I was thinking I needed maybe a bit of advice on how to approach this. A bit of money might be worth it in the end so I don't tarnish my relationship with my roommates."
35722,7vij01,mousesmouse,Best friend drifting away?,"I've debated whether to post this or not for ages. My best friend is like my sister and has been there for me through really hard times, and I've been there for her. We're similar in so many ways, run a small blog together and I love her to bits. On new years eve she was set up with a guy and they've been dating ever since. Since their first date, we hardly talk. She doesn't even want to talk about him much, and when she does she talks about quitting her job for him, and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. They go out drinking a lot, almost every night, it seems like he spoils her and she's told me she's really happy. But at the same time her anxiety is still bad. She's lost her ambition to travel, adventure and take up new hobbies. She doesn't contribute to the blog anymore but says she still wants to carry it on (our domain doesn't expire until July). I feel like I've lost my best friend, but I'm mostly scared that she's already lost herself because of a guy and I just don't know what to do. I've stopped chasing her for plans because she's always busy now (we used to meet up weekly), and stopped messaging because there won't be a reply. She checks up on me every now and then and I haven't been doing well at all, but I don't want the few times we talk to be negative and depressing. I just feel so clueless right now and I miss her. Any advice?"

He owns a small business and I’ve gotten pretty close with the majority of my coworkers as well, specifically one of my managers. There was a dispute between her and one of the other employees and she offered to hand her phone into him because she wanted him to see their messages for proof. 

She told me that when she got it back however that it was open to her and her boyfriend’s snapchat conversation. She looked over the security camera footage and sent me a video that showed him looking through her photographs and going on apps that clearly had nothing to do with the situation at all. 

She’s decided to quit and is going to confront him about it in her resignation letter. So far I’m the only person she’s told besides her boyfriend and she’s not sure who else she might tell about it.

Right now, I’m just at a loss for words. I would have never expected him to do something like that and I’ve always had a much more positive perception of him than everyone else at work. I’ve defended him my whole life but now I’m not sure what to do. I’d hate for anyone to get away with something like that but I’m also absolutely petrified of the embarrassment and I suppose even possible legal actions as a result to it getting out.

I've been taking everyone advice and have been very active in making all the ""moves"" so far. The problem, is that he's not doing any of the things a ""typical"" guys does, and I'm getting disheartened by what appear to me as mixed signals. Are these just introverted guy actions? Can you help me understand them?

--always really engaged in conversation in person (questions, talked for hours) but otherwise very passive (won't initiate things, doesn't add or interact with me on social media)
--takes a long time to respond to messages (when he does, they are long and include questions, etc)
--has not flirted explicitly  (I sent a message and he completely ignored the flirty part, only addressed the rest)
--not interested in getting together right away (literally said he's going away so suggested we hang out weeks from the last time)
--gave me a hug last few times he saw me (could just me friendly, but he's a generally nervous guy, so i was surprised) 

Can anyone make sense of this? To me, these things look like mixed signals and tell me he isn't interested. To be honest, I've been burned by guys giving me mixed signal before (though, those men were very confident and outgoing). But, I'm willing to give it one last push if these things can somehow be explained as shyness. Enlighten me!"

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short, I was friends with a super toxic person, we had a massive blowup, and I cut her off from my life. However, we do have a mutual friend. Although I use friend loosely solely because we don't talk often (often going several weeks without a word); however when I do see him he's always been super sweet to me. I met him through my toxic friend and I don't know how much he knows about our blowup, but I saw him several months afterwards and we hung out for a good several hours together. He never gave me the impression that something was amiss, although I know that he and toxic friend are still super close. 

Within the past couple days, I've started to grow increasingly paranoid him and toxic friend. Things like she's using him to look at my social media (which makes me even more paranoid about what I share), he actually secretly hates me like she did, etc. Even though he has NEVER given me any indication of this. 

I know this is totally on me and please don't think I'm going to act on this paranoia and cut him off or whatever. I just need advice on dealing with it, since I know this paranoia is really on me. I do see a therapist because of everything that happened but my next appointment is not for awhile and this has been really eating away at me."

35991,7ugc0t,coolsleeves,My mother who I specifically moved away from is now asking to rent an apartment with me.,"""Bit"" of background I am 24 and grew up in a small town about 30 minutes away from the bigger city I live in now with my father.  After my parents got divorced when I was 6 I lived mostly full time with my mother except for the occasional weekend with my dad. After my freshman year of high school we moved about 5 hours south of where I grew up because of my step dad's job.  
I never liked it down there and always wanted to go back up north. I started to get very depressed and anxious about everything and my mother was one of the causes. I'm not 100% sure why as we don't have the worst relationship but it's never really been good. She has always been nagging, manipulative, had a very fragile self worth, and is disillusioned as to what a healthy relationship is. At this point in my life it just seems that when I'm around her she frequently makes me angry and irritated (sometimes irrationally so). We just don't mesh well together and we get along much better with some distance between us.   
I finally convinced myself to ask my dad who lived back up north if I could move in with him while I get some stuff figured out. He said he would be more than happy to have me and I moved about 7 months ago. I got a job and have made some friends and am very happy up here!  
But now my mother who also hasn't ever really enjoyed the move has been looking for a way to move back up as well. So she's been visiting a lot (which stresses me out each time) as well as also applying for any full-time job in her field just to be able to make the move.  
The problems are that  
1. My step dad more than likely can't make the move with her as he works in a field where a degree is now standard and he started before that and doesn't have a degree so he would struggle with finding a job if he left his current one.  
2. Her current lease isn't up until August so I would be living with her until then because she can afford something on her own after that point.  
3. She doesn't entirely know that she is one of the reasons I moved.  
So she just asked if I would be willing to move in with her until August if she were to find a part-time rather than full-time job. For the sake of my mental well-being I very much want to say no. I know that that will crush her because ""I really can't stand her that much?!"" Or ""But I really want to move too and you're not going to let me!?""  
Idk what I'm even really trying to ask here. I guess just how can I say no in a way that doesn't seem entirely selfish and or break her heart? Or should I just suck it up because she's my mother?"

Neither do I get angry if something happens, not truly. I try to force it out of me, but just a couple of years ago all of it came naturally, it's like my emotions have been muted or just dampened over time.

It's not a big problem or maybe it is, but I think it's taking a toll on my ambitions, because I cant really find passion in anything. I used to love comics, was incredibly fascinated by how computers work, was a horny little dog that wanted to pile anything on two legs. None of that's really the same anymore, it's all just meh. I'm not completely emotionless, but I just dont feel for things as strongly as I used too, and I want that drive back.
I think what worries me the most is that I loved being with people and hanging out. Now I cant bring myself to listen to a conversation properly, and I'm just not as witty or creative with my responses. It's very (monotone?)

14088,btgdab,OverallReindeer6,"My wife is going to use a sperm donor to conceive. She's a Latina and I'm Indian. We've decided on a Latin sperm donor, because she doesn't identify with Indians. Not sure how to feel about this, and worried about what people may think if child doesn't look like me.","Firstly, the reason we're using a donor is because, I have a genetic mutation in my sperm (Y chromosome deletion) that leads to infertility. 

Either way, I was fine and I assumed she'd want to pick a donor similar ethnicity to me.

However, my ethnicity has always been a problem for her. She doesn't like India (can't say that I blame her), hates the caste system, the Indian culture of pushing people into education, arranged marriages etc.

She loves me, but sometimes resents the fact how people view her as she's married to an Indian. Now I'm not bad looking, I'm a bodybuilder, did modeling before, DJ, I'm a great Latin dancer (kinda how we met). But my main career is a being a data scientist and many times she says people see her as the woman who married some Indian geek. That's until they get to know me. 

An example she brings up a lot is her friend, she married a black soccer player. She says whenever her friend tells people about her husband people assume she's this cool girl who bagged the athlete, while my wife is the one who married the geek.

Of course I have a huge fucking issue and complex over this now. But I do understand, I just hate that she doesn't feel proud on her own of me. To me it sounds very immature and highschool like. 

That said, my wife is brilliant and extremely attractive. She's got an amazing body, has a high powered career, often makes more than me due to her bonus. She's very wise and mature and genuinely loves me. Hell she just spent months trying to hunt down the best breeders for a dog I've always wanted. She even made trips to see the dogs parents exercise etc. Very very sweet.

She has legit told me that she hates that I'm Indian, she loves me, is very attracted to me, but doesn't like being associated with Indians. Yes it's kinda racist, but the reasons she laid out explain her prejudice is more against the culture rather than the people. She thinks Priyanka chopra is one of the most gorgeous women alive.

So naturally, she says if it wasn't me fathering her children she wouldn't want to have half Indian kids. I get that.

So the sperm donor hunt settled on a Latino men, dark skinned ones mainly.

So my question is, if I could have impregnated her, our kids wouldn't have looked Indian, but there's a high chance they would have done resemblance to me. Using a donor, the only thing they may have similar to me it's their skin complexion.

I'm worried they come out looking nothing like me and I'll have people thinking she cheated on me. Obviously to close friends and family I can just say we used a sperm donor, but again this isn't something I want everyone to know too.

And do we tell the kids when they're older? I'd hate if they realized I want their biological dad and they start resenting me."

I'm almost 40 and my promising long-term relationship is crumbling due to my self confidence and depression issues.

After some thought, I've decided that I need a way to reset. I've spoken to some close friends and mental health professionals and have concluded that the best way of doing so is to move away from home for a while and refocus on myself. Luckily, my professional situation allows me to do so although it will come with a few challenges:

- I'm halfway through my new (and expensive) lease
- I'm still not 100% recovered from a 5 year old accident that lead to shoulder and knee surgeries
- As a lifelong city dweller, I have never learned to drive so that limits where I could go

However, I truly feel that this is a life or death situation. With that in mind, my primary objectives right now are regarding mobility and independence:

- Physical recovery: get my legs and arms stronger as I've neglected them due to competing priorities that seem silly right now
- Learn to drive: this is scary due to some childhood trauma and possible that I won't be able to do this in a matter of weeks but it would be amazing if I could make progress on that
- Disconnect from toxic attachments: Have many people in my life that have proven to be negative influences.

In terms of where, there are a few requirements:

- In the US per professional requirement
- Good public transportation or Uber/Lyft coverage
- Be able to safely jog in the morning and evening

Other than the basics (bathroom and bed), I really only need a room with access to a fridge, reliable internet (important) and a way to get occasional deliveries for work. However, in walking distance, I would want:

- Gym, especially if they have trainers experienced with injury recoveries
- Decent restaurants, not just fast food
- Laundry also

Given the requirements and details above, I'm reaching out to the sub for advice on:

1. Any good recommendations as to locations I should look into? 
2. Anyone tried something similar? How did it go?

Thanks for reading all this and for any advice you may be able to offer."

12504,c152x5,100outof10,"My sister is a terrible person, I'm turning into her, and I don't know what to do.","Obligatory English is not my mother tongue.

My sister has been my bully for the longest time. She is older than me by three years, and she used to treat me like absolute shit. In our teenage years, where kids were the most sensitive, she called me things that gave me insecurities to this day. I'm a chubby person, and she has called me ""a fat cunt"" since I was 12. She brings this insult back whenever we have a huge argument, and she is an absolute dick about it. I train for two hours around 2 times a week for a labour-intensive sport, and I'm slowly dropping the numbers. My confidence is coming back up. The last time we argued and she called me ""a fat cunt"", I was hurt still, but I told her I wasn't insecure about it anymore, and she retorts with ""You should be"". Set me back to ground zero. Whenever I bring this up to her in a regular conversation, she would reply with ""but I don't do that anymore!"" like it solves it. She still does it whenever she's angry, first of all. Second, just because she ""stopped"" doesn't mean the insecurities are gone. She does the same with ""You have no friends"" ""You are terrible with people/with socializing"" ""You have shit grammar"" (or just correcting my grammar in general, we grew up in a country with English being our second language, with her being older, she was much better at English when we moved to Canada) and all have that gave me lasting scars because of how true they were, and how much I loved her. Did she care she was hurting me? When she was younger, maybe. She has written me notes about being sorry but doing the same the next day. She has played very sick jokes on me that threw me into a complete panic attack, which I ended up calling my friend, crying through the entire phone call, calling kids help phone right after, and being very close to dialling 911. There were also forms of physical abuse, but there are some things I won't say because I'd breakdown again if I had to. 

That doesn't do her terribleness justice, but I'll leave it at that. Time for my asshole-ness. Now I would find everything I know she's insecure about: terrible grades, unstable relationships, failing her driver's license, and poke fun at it. Today I found her crying in our younger brother's bedroom(whom we both love and fight over) because of something shitty I did today. She has been treating me better recently, but I can't forget what she had done to me. She told me she had depression, ADHD, and anxiety. She hasn't been diagnosed but she is very sure of it. On my side, I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Social Anxiety. But she mocks me constantly for it, and has even gone to screaming at me in a restaurant for being unable to get our server to come and saying I was just ""being lazy"". At this point, I don't know if I still have any love for her left. The main reason she is upset is that she is treating me ""well"", by letting me sit at the same table as her, by helping with school, etc. She would always be insulting me the whole time, but help is help, and her acts of kindness are still there. She acts like this month of niceness can cover up my trauma, and that if I'm mean to her in ANY way, I'm a shitty person. I'm beginning to feel like I am. She's treating me like I used to treat her but worse, and I'm treating her like she treated me just without the physical abuse. How terrible am I for doing so? Should I be trying to fix our relationship? Should I ""forgive and forget""?"

I struggle with talking to people of different skin color or LGBTQ members.
Its not because I hate people in those groups, I promise. But...I'm a straight, white male, raised in a moderate income household.

I'm the embodiment of white privilege and straight privilege. Even worse, I get uncomfortable when I see gay couples or transgender people in public.

I WANT to talk to people who are different than me, but I am so ashamed of who I am. I don't want to say something to someone that could sound insensitive or something. But I also know NOT talking to them makes it look like I think I'm superior to them and therefore refuse to speak to them.

Summed up: How can I interact with LGBTQ people or people of color without offending them?"

We’ve been together for 3 years. We are both 20 years old. 

One random night he decides to tell me he’s not sure if he wants to continue the relationship mainly because he misses being single. I can understand that so I decided to take a 2 month trip to visit my family in Florida to allow him time alone and hopefully he can come to a conclusion on weather or not he wants to be with me. 

On one side I am hopeful and think this break will bring us closer together and help us have a better relationship than before. 

Then on the other side I feel like I spent all this money to visit my family, put school on hold, left my job, and my home all for nothing. I feel stupid because here I am still being loyal to a man that isn’t even sure if he wants me. And if at the end of all of this he decides he’d rather be single then I’d really feel stupid. Because I sacrificed my whole life just for him to decide he still doesn’t want me. 

I don’t want him to think that I’ll just be some stupid little girl wrapped around his finger while he can go out and fuck around with other girls for 2 months while I’m away. Part of me wants to just say fuck it and ghost him. I didn’t deserve any of this. We weren’t fighting. Everyday was a good day. I loved my job. I was getting my education. And then out of the blue he wants to be single. Please what should I do? "

6211,cwushy,throwawayorwhatevaaa,my uncle is a pedo,"my uncle is a pedophile.

so i’m a very nosy person. this has always ended up getting me in trouble, but never something like this. one day, i decided to be nosy and look through who my uncle was following on instagram just to get a laugh out of who he was following, if they were stupid pages etc. then i came across an eleven year old girls profile in his following list. i thought it was odd, so i decided to look further into it. 

i looked at some of the girls pictures and saw that he had commented. things saying she was “sexy” and she “looks good in that bathing suit” and, i kid you not, “many guys would love to have you as their gf, me included”. on an eleven year old girls instagram. many creepy older guys around his age commented on the girls pictures. i felt sick to my stomach. i honestly didn’t know what to do. i just remember laying in bed crying. i haven’t told anyone what i found yet. a few years ago his account was hacked, but, i honestly think he was faking it. who would hack a 52 year old mans instagram? and all that happened was “lude” pictures were put on his page but then got taken down. you could chalk it all up to be he really did get hacked, but there’s more.

 he follows other girls around this age as well, but i can’t see them as they have private accounts. and i looked up the signs of a pedophile. he showed many of them. he still live with his mom, my grandma, he’s not married, nor has he ever had a girlfriend, he’s interested in things that kids would normally be interested in, like the muppets, he’s always been very quiet but normally open up around girls my age (15). he also is super protective over his room, like he doesn’t want someone to find something. when we go to the pool, he always has his sunglasses on so you can’t see his eyes, but i always have gotten the eerie feeling his eyes are on me. if my mom points out a young girl in public with a cute outfit on, he whips his head around to look at her. 


i don’t feel safe around him anymore, and lately it’s really been getting to me. i’ve been having nightmares about it for weeks now. i should’ve told when i was able to. i’d mustered up the courage to tell my mom about it tonight and when i went to check the profile to show her, it had been deleted. i’m absolutely crushed. i don’t have any evidence now. i’m scared as well. i don’t want to tear apart my family, but then i imagine all the poor girls he’s more than likely perved on. i don’t even know how to go about telling my mom, and if whether or not she would bring attention to it. that’s her brother. they have an amazing bond and i would hate to tear it apart. i’m stuck at this point. 

tl:dr - my uncle has been commenting completely horrific things on young girls instagram but all the proof i have is gone."

15548,bmhhou,selfdestructingmsg,Someone I kind of know is stalking a voice actress on Instagram,"Throwaway for obv reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start this off by saying that the person in question I know as a friend of a friend from school. From the limited time I have talking/interacting with him in person, he's really edgy/creepy, strong school shooter vibes from him. Constantly telling edgy jokes, only really talks about a few different topics, gets in trouble a lot, barely shows up to his classes. (high schooler, senior now, 2 years younger than me)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I followed him on Instagram recently, and noticed he posts 3-15 times a day, with most of his posts being related to a specific voice actress with only about 100 followers. Every post about her tags her, and is almost presented in a way to suggest that the posts are specifically ""for her"", often asking for direct input. She usually responds to most of those posts, too. I don't think that she understands what's going on, or that she could be putting herself in danger by giving him constant feedback whenever he asks for it.

&amp;#x200B;

The posts are often regarding drawings of her, or action figures customized to look like her, and often use phrases like ""princess"" in reference to her. He has at least 8 of these toys.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to do. This could end really badly. No idea if this is the correct sub to post this to, if it's not, let me know of a better option in the comments."
23387,9d6acv,DudeBored,How do I talk about cleanliness with the family I babysit for?,"I babysit for a family four days a week. I’m not a neat freak by any stretch but their house is dirty and I’m not sure how to approach it. 

There are flies (house flies and fruit flies) everywhere. Whenever I bump into the kids high chair, a swarm of fruit flies comes out. There are two dogs that get into the trash and are just stinky. One dog is in heat and is leaving small drops of blood wherever she goes. And there are piles of dishes to the point where there are no clean dishes in the cabinets. 

Before I started babysitting, I asked them if they wanted me to do light housework like dishes or a load of laundry. They said no. “We’d rather you focus on the baby. Don’t worry about it.” 

There was one day last week where every dish was dirty again. I ran two loads through the dishwasher and there were still more when I left. They were unhappy because they thought I was doing dishes instead of watching their son. I told them I did it during his nap time but they still seemed annoyed. 

Not only is it kind of gross to work in, the son I watch is two years old and gets into everything. I worry that he’ll pull pots of the counter or he’ll eat some old food and get sick. 

What can I do?"

My professor instructed the class to go to some graphics/printing place in another part of town in order to buy our textbook due to some copyright or distribution issues with the authors of the book that didn't allow us to buy the book directly or even pay for a e-book or PDF version. 

So anyways, today I drove down to the place and the door was locked, so I called the phone number on the front door and asked to see if anyone was there. The guy came a minute later and let me into the store. It was a small space and he and I were the only ones there. As I walked in, he started making conversation with me, but he was asking really personal questions. Stuff like how many girlfriends I've had and if I took after my mom or my dad. I was definitely weirded out but didn't think too much of it because I was just there to get my textbook and leave. So he continues talking to me while I'm there, and as I'm paying for my book, he goes to my side, almost behind me, and hugs me from around the waist. He then proceeds to start rubbing my stomach while he's talking to me, and in my mind I was just thinking, ""What the actual fuck?"" I felt his hand go a bit lower toward my waistband area so that was when I was like hell naw and I jerked out of his grasp. After that happened, he went to go get the receipt and handed it to me so I just said thank you and got the fuck out of there as quickly as I could.

I think I'm set on telling my professor about what happened, and I already warned my classmates in our group chat about getting their book from the store, but I don't really know what to think or do about the situation. I'm just completely mind-fucked right now and I can't really process what had happened at the moment.

I'm 19, my friend's underaged and she's getting sexually harassed by someone in their ***30's.***

Yes, he knows.

- His response to her being underage is ""my daughter is 15.""

- while giving her a lift back to our main building in a golf cart he said, ""You should ride on my lap, so I can feel you better.""

- he's been harassing other female coworkers.

- he won't stop commenting on her body.

- this has been going on for a week now.

After telling me all this, I told her she should report him to HR, but she says she's too afraid to.

I told her I can always do it for her, I'll even make sure her name isn't brought up, but she doesn't want me to do that. 

She's conflicted and doesn't know what to do.

I know what needs to be done, but what can I do?

I know who it is, just not his name, so I can't identify him.

Even if I did, should I go behind her back and go to HR anyway. (That's what I was tempted to do.)

What more advice can I offer to her, because it hurts seeing her so down, now, compared to her usual goofy self?"
2646,dfx67t,Bellasoleill,2 1/2 years later and my ex admitted to cheating and everything else,"Last night. I mean this morning? 
I woke up yesterday to seeing my first high school ex followed me on Instagram. I’m freshly out of a breakup that absolutely destroyed me. I said hi to him and then the conversation flowed. Two hours later he asked if he could call. I said sure “ but your number is still blocked lmao” anyways long story short. He called. We talked until 5 am. Almost cried a few times. Which is funny because I never thought I’d feel anything towards that person. But he hurt me. I told him ways he made me insecure at (already a careful time with me in an eating disorder treatment during our relationship), the continual infidelities and his usual mood switches. Plus all the baggage he gave me with my trust issues: He apologized numerous times, where they were actually sincere,  and said that he has tried for over two years to stop thinking about me. Funny. He was the one that ended it. Anyways he did admit that he needed to grow up and get therapy (which he did) and to work on himself. Ironically he got out of a toxic relationship 3 weeks ago. To each their own. He also admitted that he has never been happy with anyone then when he was with me. Which is odd because yet again I was the one he hurt to the point I almost had to take all my online classes,  and pushed me to graduate early! So haha. I succeeded. I ended up talking about my ex, sad topic still. And then the funny times of when I lost my virginity and the sex life after. That was so hilarious. Honestly I don’t get how people think it’s awkward talking to someone about your old sex life. I died. LMAO. So I ended up passing out on ft and woke up to  it still being on. Then a morning text. He said that I probably still hate him and it’s valid. because although I’m not in that time of my life or even the same person I was. I always wondered why tf it was such a disaster. Then again high school always is ;) 

Tltr: moral of the story ex reach out. Haven’t talked to him in YEARS. Hurt my heart with his cheating and crazy mood swings. Apologized, got help, and I accidentally fell asleep on ft with him until this morning. What do I do? Like advice pls. I’m still healing from my last boyfriend who broke up with me 4 Months ago. To the point where I’m still sick over it. Do I go for coffee and see him? Or block and ignore. He did say that we needed to both grow up from this time in our life. Which is one of the many things he could never think in the future or outside his bubble when we did date."
31262,8aom3k,pearlmainstay,"Roommate has problem with authority, concerned with his stability.","I’m going to try to keep this short, because I don’t want it to be a rant. I need advice. 

I’m a 28f, pregnant, deal with anxiety, living with boyfriend and roommate. 
I met my roommate through work, 24m, Caucasian, legally deaf (can hear with hearing aids). Learned after moving him with him that he is a hypochondriac but NEVER cleans himself or surroundings. Hoards expired food in fridge and Ruth cupboards. *Extreme problem with authority, whether that is police, store security, or even apartment office staff. *

A year ago he was arrested for fare avoidance and assaulting a cop on public transportation. Since then, he’s taken to Facebook about hating ANY type of police presence. “Cops are pigs” “deserve to be shot” Etc. I disagree with this type of sentiment. I agree that are obvious issues going on with police brutality but I don’t believe strong violence and hatred are the answer. 

I’ve recently come to learn he was never charged with assault on an officer. He was only charged with theft. For some reason he has been lying that he has been charged with this. 

Moving on to the issue at hand, stay with me here. He failed to report a leak under his toilet in his separate bathroom. It became so bad that the toilet wobbles upon touch and the floor is sunken in for a foot and a half around the base of the toilet. Any time we have an inspection, or maintenance request, he views it as infringement upon his private even though the staff leaves 24-72 hour notices. 

This week we had a 72 hour maintenance request for mold mitigation stemming from his bathroom problems. He knew they were coming in. However, we were not aware that we had to be out of the apartment for 4 hours because they were going to be using a fogger to kill mold. He freaked out on me as I knocked on his door at 9am, the expected arrival time for maintenance. We were able to prepare for the fogging, but he had to leave for work two hours early. I felt bad, but was happy the mold problem was being solved. I drove him to work and he seemed fine. 

He posted a rant on fb about how they illegally entered the apartment, kicked him out, and didn’t give him a time frame to come back. While this was true that we didn’t know about the fogging, they were in the apartment legally and he did know the time frame in which we could re enter the apartment. It was such a bad post that I had people messaging me, asking if I had been evicted. 

He came home that night at 11pm after my boyfriend and I were already asleep, and started POUNDING on the shared wall between our bedroom. Legit freaking out because he didn’t know if it was safe to be in the apartment, and it was directed at us. It was a borderline unsafe situation for me to be in. My boyfriend told me to stay in the bedroom and he dealt with the situation. Roommate apologized. 

Next day the roommate posts another rant about what happened. My boyfriend and I decided that the situation had become hostile, as he was ranting about it the same way he does about police and authority. 

We told him we weren’t kicking him out, but for his own happiness he should find another place to live as the remodeling on his bathroom hadn’t even begun. We foresee future problems with maintenance as he will soon have them in his bathroom all the time. He will also soon only have access to our bedroom’s master bath. I don’t feel safe allowing him to come into my bedroom. 

We told him this over Facebook message, as we wanted to be non-confrontational after how he reacted the other night, however he refuses to speak to us and is increasingly passive aggressive. My dishes are going missing, and he is slamming cupboards, dishes, his door etc. His increase of ranting posts about police, the apartment complex are also concerning. His posts are delusional. I am becoming increasingly worried about the state of his mental health and my safety. 

What should I do?

EDIT 1: Cannot break lease, as he is on it and all three of us would need to sign off on it with management. 

Cannot leave lease and leave him on it, he cannot afford to pay rent on his own or even at 1/2 rate and would not sign off for us to move. "

Whenever I go places,like to the park or even to restaurants people ask me where I am from or if I am from same country as them. Especially at school they ask me like a million times where I am from.
The problem is that I am not Brazilian. I am actually Mexican. But I lived in Brasil all of my life I was even born there and i consider myself Brazilian. Even my parents, grandparents lived there for years. 
Over there I didn’t have any problem with my ethnicity and there if you speak Brazilian you are considered Brazilian no matter if you are black, white ect, so no one used to ask me.

I feel very bad to lie but i never considered myself Mexican only ever Brazilian and I am more proud of being a Brazilian then of where I am real from. I am thinking if I should tell them so they leave me alone because whenever they ask I say, why does it matter?

It’s not as if I have any problems with being a Mexican, but it’s just weird for me. 
Also because. Since we came here my parents act like they are super proud Mexicans, but over there, they never even talked about it.

I am devastated and I can't do anything about it but watch. And I hate that, it makes me sad and mad to see that she likes him. Ugh!  And now it seems she has to choose between me and him. 
But I hate it, I hate that she has to choose. She said she loves me but yet somehow she has to choose??? If I dated anyone then I'd kick them the hell out and have her. There is no contest, I would have her back in a heartbeat. But she dates this guy now and she has to decide? I'm sorry for the rant, but if she loved me, like she said, then wouldn't she choose me over this new guy!
It bothers me that this is a contest now. Like she JUST MET THIS GUY, she legit just met him she said! And this new guy and I have to compete? Yet me and her have history. We dated 6 months and we were best friends for..like over a year I'd say. We've only been broken up for almost 2 weeks, how can she lose the feeling of love so fast. I loved her with everything but she got over me so quickly and now it's a contest!?!  
Sorry for rant, it just happened pretty recent so I'm just sad at the moment. I miss her.

38867,7liwhu,Reddit_Account_C-137,How do I help my sister with school?,"My sister is a freshman in high school and she's really struggling. I never had issues in school, but seeing her struggle is really hard for me and my mom. Our parents, especially my dad, both came from very strict families and they just can't seem to make sense of someone doing so poorly in school as they were often disciplined pretty harshly.

Every time I approach her to try and help she'll change the subject from school and completely try to avoid the conversation. I know she hates school and had terrible grades this first semester (1.2 GPA) but I believe she can do better. She has lost a lot of faith in herself after failing time and time again but I believe she can do better.

In my opinion her biggest problems are fundamentals, such as basic reading comprehension and some algebra skills, as well as forgetfulness. She very frequently forgets to do homework or claims something was not taught in class but if I look through her notes, the subject is in there.

I want to know if anyone here has any recommendations on how I can approach her and help her? If you have any additional questions please ask away."

As the title  suggests I’m 28 and looking to go back to studying part time. I know that’s not hard for a lot of people but my situation is kind of shitty. I haven’t really been doing too well as an adult, I’ve only worked in shitty jobs just to make enough money to get me through each week and I’ve always been very bad with money (that’s a whole other issue I am trying to work on). I have no savings and a bad credit rating because I really have been a shit adult. So basically, I can’t just walk into tafe right now and apply because I don’t have the money or skills. I technically was in high school until year 11 but I don’t have my year 10 certificate. 

So, while I am trying to save some money and get my life back on track I am wondering if there are any free courses or very cheap that will help me build steps towards getting a proper education. I am not 100% sure what I want to do for a career but I would love to study psychology. Ideally, I would like a job where I can help people. As someone who has struggled and is still struggling with addiction, I would love to be able to help young people from making the same mistakes I have and realise life is more than just today and tomorrow. 

I’m sorry this is so messy, I have a lot of thoughts I am trying to get out. Basically I am looking for advice on how to get ready to get back into study. I am in Australia so any aussies that know of online courses or anything like that would be super helpful. I know next to nothing about higher education and I have no idea where to start.

23201,9e9ist,PeridotPopcorn,How to deal with racist comments with assertiveness and grace,"I struggle with this. I'm Asian American 26F, and when people see me, they think I'm a foreigner. Maybe people think they can pick on me because I'm soft spoken and nice, but I want to learn to stand up for myself and not let their negativity affect me. 

I've been made fun of, stereotyped, and treated like a foreigner all my life. So it's a sensitive issue for me. I accept that this is something I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life. But I want to learn to handle it better. When I'm in public and am harassed with racist comments, I've always tended to react. I'd yell at the person, call them an asshole, or tell them to fuck off. I'd get angry, which is probably what they wanted, and it would ruin my day. Basically I've had people stay stuff like, ""ni hao, konnichiwa, hello China"" for no reason! &amp; then people always ask me about where I'm from, no, where am I REALLY from. It's sickening.

I'm a nurse at a hospital, and deal with racist comments from patients and coworkers (even other nurses!). So basically, I've handled these comments calmly, but I felt like they got away with treating me like that. Like I really wanted to put them in their place but didn't know how to do so calmly so I just answered their annoying, persistent questions about my cultural heritage. When I try to tell people I'm an American, it's like they won't believe me and keep trying to ask questions about my culture as if I'm of a different species or something.

How do you all handle racist comments in a mature, professional way that makes you feel good about yourself?"
31286,8amk22,throwaway8273729,What do I do about a friend who thinks I’m using him?,"So my friend (lets just call him Joe) who I thought I was really close with and could trust had been kind of distant with me. He just gave really short replies when I tried talking to him and we seemed to kind of fall off. Plus, the few times we talked, we just had some short normal conversations and yesterday he just randomly said some rude things about how I looked. Like for no reason he had to pick out all the flaws about my appearance. So today he messaged me because apparently my other friend had asked him why we weren’t close anymore. Joe brought this up (I didn’t know my other friend had even asked him this) and then proceeded to say to me “we were never close”. And I was really hurt and confused by this. I never did anything behind his back or did him wrong so it hurt a lot to know someone I trusted so much didn’t return it. So it got into this whole “argument” that consisted of me trying to understand why he was acting so rude towards me for no apparent reason. Then he told me that he “knew I was using him”. And I want to put out there that I never used him or had any intentions of doing that. I tried really hard to understand why he thought that I was doing that but the whole time he gave short replies that showed he didn’t care. I called him but he declined and every time I tried to get him to tell me how exactly I was using him, he just said something about how he didn’t have to explain himself. He just acted like he didn’t care at all about our friendship. And maybe he doesn’t but I always thought he did. The conversation ended with him brushing it off saying he was going to watch some TV show. So now I just need some advice. Am I supposed to keep trying to reach out to him or is it not worth it? I just need some help on what I should do. I know the obvious thing would be to not even try reaching out to him again but its so hard considering the fact that we share a lot of the same friends. 


Tldr; Close friend of mine thinks I’m using him but I’m not. Our argument consisted of me trying to understand why he’d think that and him acting like he didn’t care about the whole thing overall. Do I still try to reach out to him and explain myself or stop talking to him altogether?"
33414,836s96,throwaway2213234,Leaked Nudes,"throwaway for obvious reasons

To start the story off my friend send nudes to a ""girl"" about a month ago. After getting the nudes the ""girl"" threatened to leaked them and he basically blocked her after that. Fast forward to now the ""girl"" followed one of our friends in our group and sent him and pics and talked about him paying for sex and abusing her. He's really scared and doesn't know what to do. Telling the police probably wouldn't be an option because his parents would kill him. If a similar situation happened to you what did you do?
Should he just not care and ignore her or tell people the rumors are false? Thanks.

He is under 18.

16717,bgno87,bleepbloopbot1,What do you do when you don’t really like your SO’s friends?,"My boyfriend’s main group of friends are great most of the time. They’re funny and fun to be around. However, occasionally they make me feel uncomfortable by the amount of cheating jokes they make with me around. They’ll joke about him leaving me to dance with someone else if we’re at an event or just try to start relationship drama in general by saying things like “look how jealous and mad bleepbloopbot is” even when It doesn’t bother me. They’ll say it to the point where I will get mad though. When I’m around, they’ll also say things like “remember that one girl when we were in Vegas last time?” Or “that was a pretty sick blowjob from that one girl in the room huh?”

At an event once, some girl started grinding on my boyfriend and he didn’t do anything about it and instead just tried to call me over to help. They’re supposed to go to another event and I’m not sure if I trust him to be able to push someone else off on his own. I know that his friends will turn a blind eye or even encourage him. 

Additionally, they all love to gamble frequently. One of his friends has a serious gambling addiction, losing up to $10,000-$12,000 in a night is now the norm and he will ask my boyfriend for extra money to keep playing. I’ve noticed that he’s been asking him for more...it started off with just a hundred or two, but recently it’s been about $7-800. 

I don’t really know how to approach this. I genuinely don’t understand why he hangs out with these people."
23498,9cov2c,nahdwkanz,Should I still be with her?,"So as of now, my relationship (2 1/2 years) is going well. Maybe I tricked myself into believing so. The way we even got together may be a reason enough to be suspicious. Just stay with me and you'll see how strange this story is...

So it all started my junior year in highschool. I got a message from some girl named Brittany on Instagram. Now I don't quite remember what she told me, but she was asking if I went to the particular high school I attended. This is how it all started. She claimed to be the cousin of a girl at my school named Jessica. So slowly we began talking and talking and TALKING. Eventually we ended up talking for nights on end. I ended up really liking her and I never once met her. After about messaging for around 2 months, she told me something. Maybe I should've left then and there? Well she wasn't Brittany, she was Jessica. I didn't know what to think... I began questioning everything and she told me that she really liked me. That she was sorry about lying, but she wanted to tell me the truth because she really liked me (I was beginning to like her too). She claimed her friend and her really liked me and they would see me on campus. They both created this persona of ""Brittany"" to get to talk to me. Jessica ended up talking to me and really developing feelings for me so she took it into her own hands, I'm assuming.

FAST FORWARD. I took sometime to not talk to her, but I began to miss her. So I forgave her for lying, but I said we'd have to meet up in person because that's the only way we'd really get through each other. So we met up after many awkward attempts of passing by each other. 

FAST FORWARD AGAIN. We eventually end up together. Now here is where things get odd. I HAVE TERRIBLE MEMORY. But the first year of this relationship was terrible. She was beyond manipulative. She claimed she had a brother that she never had, that supposedly got hit by a car when she was young in order for me to feel guilty. She claimed her dad was cheating on her wife which was false. She claimed to be ""touched"" at a party. Which was false. All these lies eventually came out. Lots of lies. Including the way we got together to begin with... She said she's gotten raped, and I take that seriously so I don't doubt her, but I feel as if I can't question that. So I give her the benefit of the doubt. It's just difficult to distinguish the manipulation from reality.

*We had a little break mid way the relationship. She used her male friend to call my mom and claim that I've been doing drugs... (Has also held hands with this guy when they were hanging out during our break)*

BACK TO MY TERRIBLE MEMORY. (Current day) She claims that the reason she was like that was because I didn't treat her right. That I was mean? To this day, I get emotional if she calls me an ""asshole"" because it reminds that I must've truly been a bad person in order to deserve all that manipulation. 

NOW. I've met her family. I've spent time with all them. We all get along, except not the father too much. But I think that's expected... Anyways, I have many trust issues now. Maybe I'm wrong for having them... Maybe I should just trust her. But it's difficult with our past. We have tons of fights, but when we don't. I'm happy. She's happy. I don't think she's the same anymore. But I'm scared of what she might do if things go south. 

Any advice will help, I just don't wanna make her life worse because of my trust issues. Thanks you guys!"

(She has anxiety) We still remain in contact, and we go to different schools so I don't see her every day like normal, but she misses me, but her feelings are messed up, and she does not know how to explain it. She does however feel like once everything is sorted out, she would like to be back with me. She does not have answers for most of the questions I have about all of this like how long she thinks it will take, or if we'll even be together again at all. I really am not sure why she felt it necessary to put things on hold with me instead of letting me help, listen and comfort her, which I have done in the past. I know I have to give her the time she needs, but I have been massively depressed lately, and she was pretty much the only person I talked to, so know I have my guy friends, and they probably wouldn't be much help at all. I am still madly in love with her, and I miss her like crazy, but she does not want my help or support. I just don't know what to do. I know the right thing to do is just to wait and see, but I really do not want to lose her.

30171,8earce,racketlauncher,I want lifelong friends... (repost),"Right now, I'm in a company and working with colleagues that are of same age group as me. But in 3 weeks, I would be moving to work in another industry that is very unlikely would be working with people of the same age as me.

So with that, I'd like to make lifelong friends with my current colleagues. All of us joined at the same time period, if I may add. Since I feel it's good to have friends with the same age group as me. It's not like me and my colleagues are in bad blood as we get along swimmingly, but I feel like I'm just their ""work colleague"". Like if they go out on movies, or dinners, or excursion, they won't invite me. I'd have to ask to be included. I'm not even a part of their chat group.

So here's the thing : I want to be lifelong friends with them, or at least, friends that even after we stopped working together, we are still in contact with each other. However, they told me the reason why they don't want to ""include"" me in their main group is that sometimes I'm quite volatile. Like they say, I'm easy to anger and whine a lot, so sometimes when they're enjoying something together they don't want someone to be a debbie downer.

Obviously I'm trying to improve on it, since I really like them and want to be lifelong friends with them but I think it most likely won't happen since they view me a bit negatively.

I guess my question is: should I continue to keep trying and get them to view me more favourably within the next 3 weeks before I switch jobs in the hopes of they'll become lifelong friends with me (or at least, keep tabs with me once in a while), or should I just jump ship and hope that I'd get lifelong friends in my new work place?

I reposted this since my previous post didn't have much reply and I really need help. Please tell if I broke a rule or anything

36425,7t1o6c,5ivesos,My little brother is a brat and I don't know what to do,"Hey everyone. I'm 22 and my youngest brother is 11. 

He's a good kid, he's kind and sweet and all but sometimes he can be really bratty. Talking back, being really sarcastic and sassy, acting like he knows everything. Getting really upset or angry whenever someone tells him off or tells him to do anything.

I work fulltime but after work he's clingy af and spends a lot of time with me (I live at home). I look after him a lot on weekends when my parents are working or busy. He's very close to me because I was essentially a third parental figure to him as he's grown up but he's just very irritating.

I get that kids can be a pain especially at his age. But sometimes he genuinely makes me angry and I'm definitely not an angry person, like very little makes me want to punch something lol.

Not sure what to do - and when I get pissed off at him I feel really bad and guilty for doing so. Any advice?"

38854,7lk4sh,ohmamamama,Please help. What’s left of my family is falling apart and I want what’s best for everybody. The toughest decisions I’ve ever had to make are looming and I don’t know what to do.(drug addiction &amp; child endangerment specific),"I really need advice on how to approach my sister, and potentially what organizations I can contact to best resolve this.  I don’t know where to start,  there is no way I could properly describe just how complicated this situation is, so I feel the need to give a little backstory on everybody involved.  If I end up rambling I’m sorry. 


My name is Justin and I’m a 27 year old in Georgia.  I’m a 3rd party contractor who from April-October works for various companies providing different services at music festivals around the country.  During this time span I’m often in a new state every week. During the winter(slow season) I stay back home I’m Georgia and this winter I am driving for lyft and uber full time.  

I grew up in a family of four that was often divided.  We had about an average household income until 2003 or so, when everything bottomed out.  My parents split up twice and by the time I was 14 my dad was basically out of the picture.  He was a career server and became homeless for a while, before relocating to Florida to live with my grand parents.  I have only seen him twice in the last 10 years.  My sister(3 years older than me) hasn’t seen him since 2005ish.  They have always had a very dysfunctional relationship.  Very heated, relationship destroying arguments were a common occurrence between them.  My sister was a very talented trumpet player and soft ball player.   She took part in national events for both as a teenager.   At some point, though, she changed.  She started hanging out with trashy crowds and doing drugs heavily.  This was the beginning of her absolute dependence on drugs that would show its face in different forms over the next 10+ years.  She never graduated high school, has been imprisoned multiple times, and has always wanted nothing more to have kids.  She eventually had kids, 3 in fact.  Two boys with one man who can’t keep himself afloat financially because he has 5 or 6 children in total, and  a daughter with a physically abusive man who is currently in prison involved in gang activity.  For years my sister was capable of generating income by bar tending and other odd jobs.  I’m the past couple of years she has been incapable of holding down a job for more than a couple months at a time.  She currently does not work.

Lastly you have my mother.  My mom was the main bread winner most of my life, holding down a salary job in sales while my dad provided little supplemental income.  Around 2005 she began to experience chronic back pain among other things.  She has very severe arthritis, is very prone to kidney stones, and has various lung problems due to smoking for decades.  She cannot so much of anything physical, and she is currently on disability where she gets paid $1200 a month.  She has also been taking prescribed pain medication everyday for the last 15 years.  At one point she was prescribed very high doses of OxyContin, and can’t even keep up with what they’re giving her now.  

For the past 3 years my mom and sister have lived together, with one of the fathers of my sister 3 children living there off and on.  It is an understatement to say that house is an unhealthy environment.   My sister and Mom are constantly cussing at each other and have a very dysfunctional relationship.  My sister has stolen pain medication from my mom for years and this has strained their relationship.  My sister constantly tells my mom that she hates her and that she ruined her life, and my mom is constantly belittling my sister.   

Lately things have gotten much worse.  I’m sitting in a target parking lot on my phone right now after just getting a call from my mom while Christmas shopping.  My sister now spends her days in bed with eyes like saucers.  She is doing cocaine and Xanax regularly, and then lays in bed all day while her kids run rampant.  They are not in a healthy situation at all, they are very ill mannered and are not really allowed to play outside because my sister doesn’t have the energy to watch them.  She has seemingly given up and when my mom tries to motivate her she replies with “I don’t give a fuck”.  

My mother also revealed something disturbing to me.  So the father of my sisters two boys has another child who is 15.  He came over to my sisters house to “give presents” to my sister and her children.  This ended up with my sister being drunk later than night and somehow ending up with the 15 year old and his girlfriend.  I do not know the whole story, but apparently my sister gave them weed and encouraged sex in some capacity.  Police have questioned her about the incident and an accusation of molestation was mentioned.  You’ll have to excuse the vague details on this part I literally was just informed about it. 

I know I’ve been rambling and if you are still reading this I greatly appreciate it.  I told my sister that I’m about to start coming over weekly and help her study for the GED.  I just bought the boys soccer goals and a soccer ball for Christmas so they can get outside and get exercise.  I am trying in my own way to help the situation but given this recent news I fear that it’s too little too late.  DEFAX has already talked to my sister in the past but no action was taken.    With recent police involvement I know that it’s only a matter of time.  

I know my sister is not right for her children right now.  I have spent my whole life trying to help her and it’s like talking to a brick wall.  How can I help those children without destroying my relationship with my sister?  I cannot give up on her no matter how far she falls.  I told my mom that by having them live at a house that is in her name that she is at risk.  Even though she has fought my sister every step of the way she is still liable.

I don’t want those boys to end up orphans with no family.  What can I do?  I told my mom I am coming over to talk to my sister one on one.  Christmas is in a few days and if she is strung out I don’t want an incident at my grandmothers house.  Somebody please help me.  I’ve never had to make decisions that influence other people’s lives to this extent.  Please help.

2264,dhuv8p,AriaOfTime,I am supposed to return to work after a three month sabbatical and I feel so anxious I want to throw up.,"Background:


About three and a half months ago, I left my job on sabbatical to spend three months traveling around Europe. When I approached my job about me leaving, I didn’t expect them to approve the time off. I thought I would have to quit but, to my surprise, my manager gave me the time off. It’s a small company so my manager is also the Vice President.


Well, about a month and a half in, I returned to the US. My depression had taken a serious nosedive while I was traveling and, at the point I decided to return, I was contemplating suicide. Once I got home, I did not contact anyone, not even my friends about returning (Still haven’t). I went to a day program for depression and found it mostly non helpful but I have stabilized and am no longer actively suicidal. 


I have spent the month after the program working with my therapist and psychiatrist on therapy and finding the right meds but we have not made any great progress. I have been working at dealing with my depression for two years now, after many years of ignoring it, but improvements have been slow and minor. 


Time has passed. Next Monday is supposed to be the day I return. I need to contact my boss today about my return. I know he is already frustrated with my lack of communication. But I have spent the entire past week in breakdown mode. I am so scared of going back. I don’t know what I will tell my coworkers. I am scared of dealing with my bosses frustration. And I am really scared of returning to a job that I could barely manage mentally before, when I had my grand European tour to work towards and dream about on hard days.


Part of me really wants to not return. I still have plenty of savings and I have very strong reasons to believe I could find another job. But part of me thinks I should return. I genuinely like my coworkers and have missed them. The work environment is pretty low stress and I don’t want to burn the bridge that being given sabbatical leave and then immediately bailing before return would definitely burn. My boss, while ultimately being an okay guy, is the kind of person to hold grudges and is an important guy in the industry. Plus I have a family member that works in the same company and I am scared that it will reflect badly on them.


I have no idea what to do and am super overwhelmed. I was working with the plan to return for ~3 months (the minimum I figured I needed before leaving would be a dick move) and then try to find some part time work in my industry while I work on getting healthier. I still live at home so it would be feasible. But returning scares the hell out of me. I don’t know what to say. I don’t want to lie but I don’t want to tell the truth.

Do you think I should return or should I quit. If I return, what should I tell my coworkers when they ask about my trip?"

14970,bp8kvo,tommyp611,Freaking out about my career and next steps in life.,"A little backstory on me. I’m a 26 year old guy, turning 27 in a few weeks. I completed graduate school to earn a Master’s degree in psychology last year. I worked at a mental health agency during school and learned the hard way that the field of psychology doesn’t pay well AT ALL...unless you own your own practice and whatnot but that’s a whole other issue. I had a high position of leadership at this job where we provided counseling services to people with developmental disabilities and psychiatric disorders in group home settings. However, I grew extremely frustrated at this job and left this winter due to a multitude of reasons:

1. Terrible pay, about 33k per year before taxes. 

2. The agency would hire just about anyone to work there. Meaning that I would have to train them whether they were qualified or not. 9 times out of 10 they were laughably unqualified and even SCARED of the people we support (patients had tendencies to be violent due to their disorders). I get it, it’s not a pleasant feeling when the patients would get aggressive, but come on..if you work here you know what you’re getting yourself in to. This lead to me having to work, every single day, with the most challenging patients that displayed aggressive behaviors on a daily basis and management did nothing about this unfair workload despite my vocalized concerns. 

3. I was promised an interview for a promotion at a far superior location within the agency, and found out that the position had been filled by an outside hire before I even had the chance to have an interview. 

4. As I was driving one of the patients home, he unbuckled his seatbelt and bit my arm while I was driving. My arm was a bloody mess and I nearly crashed. To make matters even worse, I had another employee, who was recently hired and had completed all the required training, do absolutely nothing to intervene until my arm was torn apart AND HE WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT RIGHT NEXT TO ME. 

That was the final straw and I put in my two weeks notice. 

Fast forward a month or two later: I’m looking for another job, something where I wouldn’t have to worry about incompetent co-workers and, better yet, my own safety. Something where I can still help people and make alittle more money. 

My father introduces me to his long time friend who happens to be a very successful regional partner at an insurance/investment company (id rather leave the company name anonymous). I figure, what the hell, finance is completely out of my area of expertise but let’s give it a shot. I study for the licensing exam for a month straight. Pass on the first try. I complete my required training without much issue. 

I knew exactly what the job entailed upon completion of training: soliciting and prospecting in order to gain clientele to sell life insurance. I figure I start with my family, friends, and people that actually know me (this is called a warm market). I figure I would gain these kind of people as my clients before doing any cold calling and such. Shouldn’t be too hard right? I’m not tooting my own horn here, but I’m certainly a likable, trustable, smart guy. Or...at least I thought I was.  I’m thinking that this is a goldmine career for me. Well, I’m now 6 weeks into my new career and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. Not a single application filled out, not a single client, NOTHING. My manager is beginning to show major disappointment in me and I can tell he’s only keeping me on because of his friendship with my dad. I don’t want to make excuses for myself, but I can’t help but think that the people in my life do not take me seriously at all. I graduated with a Masters Degree last year and all of a sudden I’m changing careers.  My best friend, who happens to be a cop, desperately needs life insurance for obvious reasons. He knows this too. And yet, he doesn’t trust me due to his own pre-conceived notion that I have no idea what I’m doing in this new job. He ended up backing out of our deal at the 11th hour for no good reason at all, making me look like a complete jackass to my superiors. 

Not only that, I’m being ghosted by my other friends and family as soon as I bring up any kind of pitch about offering them value through my new job. These were the same people that were excited about my career change and now I can’t even get a simple response, not even a text message.  I called up plenty of people who were prime candidates from my warm market and as soon as I offer my services, the general response has been “OH here we go, I see what you’re doing, you’re just trying to sell me life insurance”. As if this is just some big pyramid scheme or scam. What’s even worse is, new agents can’t get paid until they sell 6 cases. It’s extremely discouraging. I have almost no money left, student loans are piling up, my rent just increased, and now I’m beginning to doubt if I should even bother continuing with this line of work. It’s beginning to make me negatively question a lot of things about my self and I’m trying to avoid spiraling into depression. 

This post may have gotten a bit longer than I thought it would. But I’m seriously at yet another crossroad in my life. I have no idea what to do. I don’t want to have this feeling anymore. I don’t want to burn bridges with my friends and family by pestering them and I don’t want to rely on strangers to buy life insurance just so that I can eat. I really just don’t know what to do...

20218,axiony,JebronLames8,Can a hospital and an ambulance company bill you for unwanted ER care if they only have your name?,"Hello reddit, so my gf and I are freaking out right now because we’re not sure if she is going to get billed for this unwanted ambulance ride/ER care. We are both college students and there is no way we can afford the bill. 

So my girlfriend had too much to drink at the club and while us two were heading back home in an Uber, she knocked out and then started throwing up just a little bit. This was enough for the other Uber pool passengers to call emergency care, and within minutes the ambulance came and picked her up. They took care of her and we went to the nearest hospital where she was given IV fluid and just rested in the hospital bed. We were there for about a couple of hours before she woke up and the hospital employees said we can go. 

The only information that was given for sure was her first and last name. I was pretty drunk myself when the ER came and picked us up, so I can’t remember if I gave them her address but if I did, it would’ve been her temporary address (I’m 100% sure I didn’t provide her permanent address). I also remember the ambulance guys asking me if she had insurance to which I replied I have no idea. That was the end of it. At the hospital, I remember the nurse was saying something about getting her signature but she was sleeping so she said it’s ok. And the same nurse was the one who let us go once she woke up, I’m assuming she forgot to ask for the signature? 
The hospital tag on her wrist has her first and last name but the birthdate is wrong, they must’ve misheard me. 

My question is, can the hospital and the ambulance company bill her with just the information given above? "
2743,dfe1oh,kimichoo,My grandma passed away a month ago - how can I make sure my grandad isn’t lonely?,"My grandma sadly passed away a month ago. My whole family (especially my grandad) watched her health deteriorate over the past year. My grandad had to learn how to wash, clean, iron and prepare food in this time as my grandma had practically done everything for him. 

Although I know he will get by living on his own I am really worried about him. The family he has are my grandmas sisters (one lives 10 hours drive a away) and the other lives in the same city but hasn’t even bothered trying to see him even though her and her husband are both retired. His son (my uncle) lives a 2 hour drive away but has been trying to come on the weekends. The family that live close are my mum, dad, me and my three sisters. We are all trying to visit him as much as possible while all having full time jobs. I feel awfully guilty when I am away for the weekend (as I’m in a long distance relationship) when I could be keeping him company. 

My grandad does say some worrying things like “thank you for coming to see me for 5 minutes” and “it’s really horrible going home to an empty house alone.” We live really close to his house so he has been coming round for dinner every weekend. I have offered to walk back with him and sleep at his house or he can sleep here but he keeps saying he is fine.

So my main question is how can I make sure my grandad isn’t lonely in the day when everyone is at work? he does have friends but he said he can’t face going out properly just yet as the places remind him of my grandma."

32223,86r0pz,Irb14,I don’t know how to fix the situation that I’m in,"I’m currently a junior in high school and this past year has been rough. This is an extremely condensed version of why. At the beginning of 2017, I had two amazing best friends, a nice boy that I was starting to like, and an okay relationship with my family. Unfortunately, one boyfriend (and my own stupidity) ruined all of that for me. In spring of 2017, I got into a relationship with a boy, we’ll call him Cody. He was not the boy I previously mentioned, but another one who reached out to me. We started talking and I liked his personality a lot. He was incredibly sweet, caring, and we had the same sense of humor. We would chat everyday for a couple of months before he asked me on a date, which turned into two and then three. We started our relationship soon after, which is when so many red flags started to appear. 

He was incredibly jealous, he would make things up about me and my past, and then get mad at me for them no matter how much I tried to tell him he was imagining it all. A few more months into the relationship and he was escalating very quickly. He would call me names like bitch and slut, sometimes meaning it, and other times just to get a reaction out of me. His excuse often times was that he “wanted to see if I actually cared about him and what he said to me”.  Anyways, you guys get the point. He was a jerk. Back to the jealousy. My two best friends, we’ll call them Lizzy and Leo. Cody absolutely hated the fact that I had friends, and would take every opportunity to push us apart. Unfortunately, it worked and I no longer have them or any other friends really. 

My sister found out about the way Cody was because of Leo. He warned her and my sister looked into it and found everything out. Her and my other sister had a talk with me, telling me that it was over and me and Cody could no longer date. I was relieved of course, but part of me realized that I had no one to turn to besides family. I went to school the next day expecting to never talk to Cody again, but he came up to me asking for an explanation. I gave him one and tried to go about my day alone. He followed me around as if nothing ever happened. During lunch, he spent his time trying to convince me that I had no one but him and that my family only does this because they don’t want me happy. It all sounds very stupid, I know, but my weak self fell for it. Over, and over, and over.

Months pass, and I’m hiding this horrible relationship from my family in fear that without him I would be alone. Each day is worse than the last, and he would push me to the point of tears almost everyday. He found ways to blame me for my sister finding out about him. Towards the end of the relationship, he escalated to making threats instead of just name calling. He would push me in front of everyone in between classes. He spit on me on more than one occasion, treating me worse than he would treat an animal, and generally just broke down the self esteem that I managed to build up over time. One day I broke down in front of my mom and finally told her everything. She took me to the school office and they helped me to finally leave him. 

Now, for the issue I need advice on.

Since that visit to the office, I’ve been feeling strange. I find myself wanting to cry many times throughout some days, and other days I feel (describing to the best of my ability) nothing. I have many moments that are happy, like when I’m with my nieces or when I see my dogs, but when I’m laying down in bed, or in the shower, or even just walking around school I feel a sadness that is sort of hard to describe. I’ve also noticed that my sleeping patterns are completely off, partially due to the time change, but not completely. I sleep fairly early each night (11:00) and wake up pretty late compared to others (7:00) in the mornings. However, I am exhausted in classes, which is affecting my grades as well. I can’t focus as well as I used to be able to. I get panic attacks some mornings (still pretty rarely), but I thought I had left those in the past. But the thing bothering me most of all is just the overwhelming sense of emptiness that I feel. I don’t know how else to explain it besides empty with some added mood swings every now and then.

I just want things to go back to the way they were. I don’t know how to fix any of this. Any advice is appreciated, thank you."

26762,8vo2kk,iammorethanlost,My parents don’t believe that I need help,"I come from an upper middle class family with 6 kids. 

I understand with 6 kids that it may hard to keep up with them all. But my parents are constantly dismissing the fact that they are forgetting about me. 

I’ve been experiencing extreme menstrual pains for the past year and I’ve been begging my mom for an appointment. These pains are so severe that I can’t feel my lower body when I’m on my period. She tells me that I am being a baby and it’s just a part of being a woman. She finally got one scheduled today after me and her got in a huge argument and she threw a box at me. She claims it’s my fault that I got the initial appointment rescheduled that was supposed to be in December. This is totally not true and I have no idea what she is talking about. 

I’ve been needing a car for a while now. I have nobody to take me to practices so I’ve just been not going and since my sister graduated this past year, I won’t have anyone to take me to school. I’m not asking for a much, just an old car way below what we really could be spending. They will find a reason not to like the car I find. Stupid stuff like, “oh I don’t like black”. I understand they are buying the car, but considering I’m 17 and my older sister got a 12k car when she was 15, the playing fields are not level at all. My dad just kicked me out of the house for asking to get me a car so I could finally start going to practices. I ask everyday for one I told them I plan to get a job as soon as I get the car (something my sister didn’t do). They screamed and cussed me out some more. Like I said earlier my dad just kicked me outside and told me not to come back in. 

I’ve actually needed glasses my whole life but I just got my first pair last week. I’ve been haggling them about it for the past two years. 

I definitely am a strong personality. I fight for myself. I know I will call names and the such but only when I feel threatened. My parents are quick to make fun of me and taunt me.  

I tell them that I feel like they ignore me sometimes and they go on about how much they do for us. In a way they do do a lot for us but I also feel like they both are too caught up in their jobs. My mom spends all of her time on Facebook trying to make us look like the perfect upper middle class white family. 

I do think they are good people but they are too full of themselves to see that they can make mistakes too. 

I’m not a cryer but I’m sitting outside in the dark by a tree stump just crying. I feel like a loser. I feel alone. I feel like I have no options and I can’t ever make this better because I try everyday and I get nowhere. Somedays I feel so worthless I wish I were dead. Not that I want to kill myself, just that something would kill me.  

Every time I voice to my parents that I feel like something is wrong with me emotionally they say that I’m a baby and I don’t really know because I’m too young to have depression. They always play this card. I don’t think I have depression, but I do have a problem with bottled up emotions to the point it causes me to lash out a lot. I’ve been taught by my parents to not express myself as they are both quite stoic people. I just want to be able to talk about how I feel sometimes but I have nobody to go to. 

I also struggle with the anxiety of being a closeted gay in a very homophobic area. I’m terrified for what will happen to me when it gets out. Even tho I’ve told nobody. 

They are very conservative people and this reflects in how they live by the philosophy “oh just tough it out”. I just can’t tough it out anymore. I’m so broken inside and I can’t bottle anything up anymore. I’m not sure where to go and I’m scared. I want to get out so bad. 

I have my doubts and I often blame myself. My parents can’t be wrong their my parents. I can’t tell if they are wrong or not. They get my siblings to gang up on me, call me names and taunt me if I shed a tear. "

29964,8exq54,lorabore,How to thank my coworkers?,"I have been battling cancer since August. I took 3 months of FMLA and short term disability off work to have massive surgery and then returned to work at the beginning of chemotherapy. 

Unfortunately my chemo completely knocked me down and I was forced to go on disability leave halfway through. I don't even know when I can go back to work since I work as a paramedic in a hospital and am currently using a walker and wheelchair to get around. I had my 7th surgery yesterday and reached out to my boss to talk about my return to work and basically explained that I didn't know when I could be back but I was trying to rehab and I asked if she could reassign me to another position as a unit clerk.  

She called me today and let me know that not only do they have some office work for me and are willing to be as flexible as needed with my recovery, but that my co-workers got together and collectively donated 150+ hours worth of PTO to me. This is literally 1 entire month of FULL pay. I've been living off my 60% long term disability insurance benefit thus far. 

How do I thank them? Like I said I work at a hospital and I worked the night shift but I know it was both day and night shift that got together and donated so I want to include both shifts in my thank you.  

I hadn't even been there a full year when I got sick and no one has seen me at work in probably 5 months, so the fact that they all remembered me and donated PTO is so meaningful and I've been crying about it all day.

We have a nurses week potluck coming up in 2 weeks and I was thinking of trying to make an appearance and bringing something. Or a card? I have no idea.  "

The first time I drove (at 15) I totaled the car, and it scared me enough that I was terrified to learn to drive. I tried, mostly out of guilt/fear of being left behind by my peers, but it was hard to motivate myself to get behind the wheel of what I thought of as a death machine. I failed my drivers test several times. Luckily I live in a place with good public transportation, so I was able to get around fine without a car and eventually  stopped trying to learn.

Now that my wife and I are looking into buying a house farther from public transportation and having kids, I’ve prioritized learning to drive and my wife’s been teaching me for the past year. However, she’s truly terrified every time I get behind the wheel, and I can’t blame her. I have an extremely slow reaction time and I struggle focusing on more than one thing at once (like staying in my lane while maintaining my speed/navigating).

I’m struggling with the question of whether I should keep trying or not. On the one hand, I feel awful that my wife’s always the one driving on long car trips, and I want to be able to drive our kids around in a few years. On the other hand, I feel like I could kill myself and my wife just by trying to learn. Does anyone have any advice for overcoming this?"

Most of the chats were from 3 years ago and really sexual, but the most recent one was from April this year (while we were dating) saying she wanted to jump on him once he got off the plane.

He is coming to stay at her house next week and I'm worried.

I know she loves me and is attracted to me, in fact she can't keep her hands off me, but whenever I express concern she gets quite defensive and worked up.

She confided in her mom that I was worried about him, and she told her not to push her into doing anything with him (which I find weird) as she's been known to do before (as she doesn't hold much hope for our relationship).

I won't be able to spend any time with her the week he's there and I know they're going to be having day trips, going out drinking etc.

I can't stop this, but based on what you all know do I have a right to be worried? She acts like I'm being unreasonable and that I'm in the wrong for expressing my anxiety about it.

She keeps denying that she fancies him anymore, but I find it hard to believe that someone she once found so sexy is suddenly an eyesore because she got with me."
4701,d5buzl,lickybummbumm,"Is it OK to be expected to make coffee for your boss, despite all others who held your position before you not having to?","I want to know if my feelings are justified on this, because lately at work I'm [27F] beginning to harbour some resentment towards my boss [44M].

Some background. I am the single employee of the business, I do the setting up of artwork and using machines like engraving, sandblasting, laser and guillotine. My boss does all the invoicing and dealing with customers.
The three older men who have held my current position before me, were warehouse-type people, whereas I come from a graphic design background and have a degree in Graphic Design.

When I was first employed, I started bringing in my own instant coffee to make in the morning and afternoon, and would always ask my boss if he wanted one if I made one for myself. 
Now, I bring in my own takeaway cup of coffee in the mornings, yet my boss now asks me to make him a coffee in the mornings and sometimes during the day too. He's perfectly capable of making his own, but he prefers me to do it. We now have a Nespresso coffee machine with a milk frother so a bit of an upgrade from what I was doing before. He always asks with a smile, sometimes it's more of an order like 'I'll have a coffee', even though it's clear I already have my own and have work to get to.

I feel petty but...it feels like I'm only asked to make coffee because I'm female, younger than him and he expects me to do so. I know none of the past employees were asked to do this, in fact they were a 'do the bare minimum' type of person. One was in his 60's, one was a drug addict and the other was quite lazy (all my bosses words).
My boss seems really happy for me to bring s bit of a more feminine touch around the place, but I resent being the coffee bitch when tbh I went to university to NOT have to do this type of stuff.

I want some advice please on what I should do, and if I'm thinking too much on this! Thank you."
13461,bwbcyi,fromageaholic85,"Wife and SIL won't speak to each other, and parent's anniversary party is coming up!","My wife (33F) and I (33M) got engaged in early 2012, and two weeks later her younger brother (30M) proposed to his girlfriend/now wife and SIL (27F). While being upset about getting engaged so quickly after us and feeling like we lost some of the time to celebrate with the family, we didn't want to bring int up, and so we moved on and chose an August 2012 wedding date. Two weeks later her brother and fiance decided to get married 5 weeks before us in late June, on the same anniversary date as my wife's parents. LOTS of tension about that which never got discussed or resolved.

My wife has had lots of problems with her SIL: feeling like she's changed her younger brother, difficulty having a conversation (lots of contrarian replies from the SIL, talking over people, refuting any opinion shared by my wife),the past resentment from the weddings, and feeling like they just 'do what they want, to be true to themselves'. Last Christmas rather than come see us or either family, the younger brother/SIL decided to have a beach picnic with just themselves, and didn't understand why the family was hurt that they didn't come for Christmas. We've confronted them about this and their inconsistency sending gifts for birthdays/holidays, and they've made efforts to improve that. We've always maintain a cordial dynamic but there's been unspoken tension brewing for a while. They moved abroad for a couple years, and we went to visit them; they moved back to the US and we now live on opposite coasts and see each other in person 2x a year.

In May the SIL texted that she would be in town and wanted to take our 10-month-old daughter for the whole day to be with her. Not knowing what her experience was with babies as well as her not having much of a prior relationship with our daughter (the younger brother/SIL never FaceTime, ask about our daughter, and had last seen her 6 months ago), we declined the offer and encouraged her to spend the weekend with us all to build a closer bond. She then stated she would not be coming to see us at all, and now refuses to speak to my wife. We had one phone call with the four of us, where the SIL read a letter stating how deeply wounded she's been by my wife's attitude about her/behavior the past years, and needs a boundary from her as being triggered by us saying no to her request to take our daughter.

We're currently planning my wife's parents 40-year wedding anniversary - my wife's brother is now the spokesperson for both he and the SIL; the SIL won't reply to texts, stopped checking the family text thread, and will not directly speak to us. We've honored the boundary she wants, but are wondering how to address this as we will all be at my wife's parents house for this party. My wife is willing to acknowledge the bitterness/resentment she's had and move forward to have a better relationship, we've heard nothing from the SIL.

TL;DR: My wife and sister-in-law are not speaking, and both (plus spouses) will be at parent's anniversary party in the same house for a weekend in June.

1. How do we interact at the anniversary party, when she won't speak directly to my wife?
2. We are honoring the boundary she's put in place by not speaking to her, but how long do we wait? What if she wants to spend time with our daughter when we're together at the party, but won't talk to us?
3. SIL has been silently eavesdropping on phone calls between my wife and her brother (brother would mute the phone and then make a comment about what his wife thinks). This was not shared but deduced, how do we respond?"
33953,81f95o,Nosism,"Considering adopting, perhaps an older child 6-12. Have no knowledge at all.","My wife and I are both teachers.

We're pretty successful, put-together people. We both came from abusive backgrounds and have a genetic history of mental health issues that make us hesitant to have kids-- even though we're both pretty awesome ourselves. My wife can be anxious, with health issues being a trigger for her, and it would be  very difficult for me to choose to subject her to child birth.

Adoption, to me, is the most ethical option if someone can find it in themselves to do so, rather than adding a new life to a crowded world. While I still eat meat even though I know its not the best thing-- this may be something that I could do to make the world a better place.

Adoption may also benefit me over having a child of my own. I have a tendency to get overwhelmed, much as I love kids, especially when sleep is interfered with, and adopting an older child might allow me to be a better parent while letting me skip some of the years where I worry I might have trouble being fair to my spouse. I'm sure I would force myself to be a good parent to a younger child-- but it would be tough to sacrifice sleep and self-care while still maintaining my current workload and responsibilities.

My wife and I-- teachers-- we obviously love children. She works with second graders and I work with middle schoolers. I have worked in the poorest district in the US with many students who were in the foster system or homeless-- I can empathize and help kids who's lives haven't been perfect and who may have triggers or behavior issues. That being said, I am not interested in a special needs child, just because part of what I would enjoy in raising a child is helping someone grow beyond what I was able to-- to maximize their potential (hopefully in a non-psychotic pressurey way).

797,dpmv9b,DeV4der,A random Internet Encounter - how to see if its fake?,"Hey everyone, hope I am in the right place

&amp;#x200B;

soo I am an overweight dude, single for over a year now, had only one longer (more than 2 Months) relationship that ended bad.

I am not very confident or in shape (good lookin? idk), but I am going to change that

however, about 2 weeks ago some girl I have never heard of wrote me on facebook (first time ANY stranger directly messages me on FB) and we've been writing a few times here and there, since she does look cute 

Now as I said I have no confidence, and being a weeb and web/pc nerd I read stories and stuff and now I am afraid that she is ""fake"" or a scammer or that she comes with dudes to mug me or rob or idk.

&amp;#x200B;

She did send me a few voice messages, so maybe she is actually female and a normal human being and I am just way to over worried and whatnot

however what does give me red flags is that she's already sending kissing smileys and she says she is really looking forward to a date that we have barely scraped at (we did say that we want to go have a drink, but not where and when yet). It just sounds like she is so eager to get to know me even though we dont know each other at all. Just names, what we do for a living and thats it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really worried that this is just another bait or fail or idk (yes, no confidence blabla) and I just wanted to get some ""advice"" from other people that could maybe give me some insight.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr: I have no confidence, good lookin random girl messages me, now I need help wether she is fake and its a bait or not"
323,dsku4h,IHaveNoThrowAwayName,Do I quit my job without another one lined up so I don't have to kiss an absolute dirtbag's ass?,"  

I’m the lone liberal in a very red office/state. I have been unhappy in my current job for a while. I don’t get paid much, and I could get paid a lot more doing the same thing elsewhere, but I just haven’t started the search yet. One reason is that I know it’s going to be hard for me to get time off to sneak around and interview. Someone in another position here quit a few months ago, and I have been doing both jobs since then. They aren’t even looking for a replacement for the other position. I’m guessing they just planned on putting it all on me for as long as they could get away with. I had a discussion with my boss about it a couple of days ago, and let him know how I felt and what I wanted. He said he would discuss it with his partner and let me know. I had already decided that if they didn’t give me all that I asked for (a raise, extra week of vacation, nothing unreasonable), that I would wait until I got my Christmas bonus and then give my two weeks notice. Fuck it, I can go work at Target. At least they offer benefits. Anyway, today I’ve learned that for the next at least two months I am going to have to be working with a very high-profile politician whose views I find ABSOLUTELY ABHORRENT. Is this one of those moments where I have a chance to stand up for my beliefs and put my money where my mouth is? Do I just refuse to work with him and walk out? Or do I suck it up and make it through to the end of the year? This office would fall apart without me because nobody knows how to do anything. Not having a job would be tough, but it’s the holidays and I’m sure I could get a seasonal job for the time being. I wouldn’t be making quite as much as I am now, but at least I won’t wake up dreading facing the day. The whole idea of quitting a job without having another one lined up sounds both terrifying and invigorating."

7330,cqz1km,PM_M3_Y0UR_TITZ,Help please: manipulative and controlling parents,"Hi. 18F here. Headed off to college in 1 week! I’m super excited to be in a new environment, as well as escape my parents. I believe my mom to be a narcissist and my step-dad just follows her lead on everything since I am not his child. My mom has been emotionally abusive for the majority of my life. Anyways, I am from a relatively well-to-do family. I have never had a job. I begged for one since I turned 16, but was always told I needed to stay home instead of working. (Little did I know, it was a manipulation tactic to keep me at home). My mom and step-dad have decided to graciously help me pay for college tuition, something I did not ask for but was generously given. It was very nice and unexpected. I still have to take out student loans, but I’m being helped more than most people. Since they are giving me money, they see that I am now a puppet. I am to do exactly as they say. I am allowed to leave home only once a week, I’m not allowed to have a job, any money they give me for “working around the house” is actually theirs so I’m not allowed the chance to even have my own money to do things I want, just to name a few things. These are all conditions until they stop giving me financial assistance for college. I’m constantly belittled and called names for not being just like them and I just don’t know how much longer I can take it. I am fucking suffocated. I’m so miserable anytime I step foot in the house I grew up in. I need their financial help for college but I cannot handle not being able to have any freedom at all. Thus my need for advice comes from that I am seriously considering telling them I do not want their help paying for college. Is this an incredibly stupid decision? I know I’m not thinking clearly right now to rationalize it or not. 

TL;DR - parents are manipulative and controlling. Do I drop their financial support for freedom?"

I don't want to upset her or make her uncomfortable, and I'm generally unsure of how to give best wishes in scenarios where the person has lost someone close to them. I personally (thankfully) have yet to experience the pain of losing someone very close and dear to me, though I can only imagine how horrific it must be.

35522,7wb8i1,Rdnyc212,Am i Clingy? Or am I have I been dating the wrong people?,"I'm a relatively busy person, I've managed college full-time, work full-time, and my hobbies and social life. When I was younger, I dated a guy a few years older than me. I'd see him once a week and keep a thread of texts throughout the week. I've always proportioned my responses to his. He would tell me he ""feared"" seeing me too often because he didn't want us to become bored of one another. I accepted that though now that I look back I see it was BS. I'd see him once a week and occasionally, there would a week where we couldn't see each other. I wouldn't get mad but would make an effort to set aside time to catch up. 

For the last year, I was dating a guy on and off. Every time we got close, he would pull away. With him, I would have brief (logistically based) conversations through text twice a week, we'd see each other once a week. He'd suggest we do things together, but when I followed up on those things he never actually set time aside to do these things with me and I would end up doing such things with other people (museums, movies, etc.) and he'd ""complain"" I went without him. I never canceled my plans to satisfy his schedule. He was all for last minute plans and I don't do last minute. There would be times we wouldn't see each other for over a week and I'd be fine with it and would go with the flow. This guy gave me the key to his apartment and some drawer space. After the holidays, he disappeared for two weeks (didn't reply to my texts) so I cut it off assuming he doesn't like me. I was always very clear about my feelings towards him- not in a ""I want to get married"" way, but in a ""I think you're fun and you give me butterflies"" way. I've brought him gifts and have gone out of my way to take care of him when he was hurt. Anyways, He eventually resurfaced, but pulled some BS saying ""Why would you doubt my feelings for you, I hate almost everyone except you."" (AFTER DISAPPEARING FOR TWO WEEKS WITH NO EXPLANATION... I DON'T ASK FOR MUCH... I'M NOT CRAZY FOR BEING UPSET RIGHT?)

As a woman, I always feel as if we're always taught to be ""cool"" and relax and give a guy his space. I enjoy my space and I fear someone infringing on my freedom, so I give my partners their freedom too but sometimes I can't tell if I'm giving them too much freedom or if I'm scaring them with my feelings and wanting to spend time with them. 

I don't trust my judgment and my friends give me shitty advice. I believe that if someone likes you and is on the same level you, your presence or desire to take up their time won't be regarded as an infringement of freedom.

We dated three years ago and it ended horribly, he cheated on me and I found footage of everything. As soon as I saw him, I left desk and told my coworker my ex had just walked in. I tried hiding in the cafe of the establishment and he followed me into the cafe and kept trying to get my attention. Eventually, I got tired of hiding and went back to reception. I made conversation with a client and kept my back to him. He waited behind me and kept waiting to make conversation with me. My coworker escorted him to an office where he could wait (after telling him to wait there 5 times- he ignored her and stood behind me trying to get my attention).

So i work in a senior position at work with a team of 14 under me 
And during a meeting with my boss (supervision/ catch up)
It was mentioned about how she is sometimes told about other staff saying im looking tired/ ""can i help do this task to take something of his plate"".
Now tbh i always look tired i usually work a 40-60 hour week due to having to cover staff sickness. And the staff team knows that as im the one who basically fixes all the gritty stuff and gets everything working (not to say im the only one doing that). While my boss has been also working at another place so splitting her hours meaning we are basically a ship without a rudder.
But back to the main point i guess, my boss works loads more hours than me like an extra 160 hours last month. But the way she was basically telling me to watch my 'persona' around people if i am tired just seemed silly. I feel like i should be able to vent around the people i work with. As well as it almost felt slightly that she was annoyed that staff where concerned for my well being and not always hers, but im the face they see every day.

I hope my ramblings make some sort of sense just helped to put it into words tbh"

1022,do4pp6,liquidchainsaw,99% sure my kids are drugging me and my wife per instruction from mother-in-law,"I have no proof. I guess, that's why I am here. It's 1:18 a.m. I'm wide awake. So is my wife. Because we both crashed around 3:30-ish. Woke up an hour ago. This has been happening lately. On weekends. Never on weekdays (that I can think of). 

On weekends for the past six months, my wife and I have crashed mid-afternoon to early evening. We're noticing it, now. At first, not so much. Maybe we're tired. Exhausted after a long week. These are the thoughts I used to rationalize my sudden desire and need for weekend afternoon nap. 

I think they're dropping pills into our drinks. I've been trying to catch them in the act for a few weeks now. My wife thinks I'm fucking nutso. But, tonight (this a.m.) she's thinking what I'm thinking. The kids are drugging us. Two of our children are prescribed sleeping aids. We keep them locked up. But the older two know what key it is. And I've noticed the keys turn up missing from time to time. Start a little search party in the house. To no avail. And. Then we find them on our dresser the next day.

I don't know what the fuck to do. I haven't called the kids on this shit yet, as I'm worried it will straight up piss off my wife. But I know the two oldest, those dudes are getting high and drunk. 12 and 13. It is what it is. It's not an everyday thing. But some days my 12 pack will just disappear. Or a few beers will.

I want to focus on the subject at hand. Right now, I'm groggy and am not thinking well. This happens every weekend. I don't know what to do. How to stop it. Getting down to the nitty-gritty; I honestly believe my wife's mother and sister are behind this. I could write for an hour as to why I think she would put the oldest three up to this, but I don't want to because it doesn't really change or add to shit. 

The last month, I've been dumping out my beer or soda if I leave a room and come back in only to see one of the kids suddenly in the room I just left. I've pointed it out to my wife. That whenever I leave my room or a room--wherever I'm dwelling at that moment--one of the kids will instantly move in. Like I step out, they step in. Out of nowhere. It's happened too many times for it to be coincidence. At night. When I'm awake. The kids will come downstairs (my bedroom is downstairs; theirs are upstairs) and peak into my room. And seem shocked when they see I'm awake. I tell them to get back to bed, but the wander down again within an hour.

I don't want my wife and I to start making false accusations. We're both pretty livid right now. Two of the kids are still awake although they're pretending to be asleep. How do I address this? Obviously, I need to know for sure. I've thought about hiding a camera in my bedroom pointed at my soda, but my wife isn't down for the clown. 

Here's a great example. I'm painting the doors in my house. So one by one, I'm pulling all our doors down by the hinges. Last weekend, I did the boys room. Asked them to help. My oldest had the hammer and the flathead screwdriver needed to remove the door. He randomly went down stairs after we pulled the door. I followed about a minute later. Went into my room. To find him seeming a little out of sorts--surprised to see me--and he rushed past me to go back upstairs to his room.

Right next to my soda on my desk was the hammer and screwdriver that he'd just had. I asked him why he put them on my desk, and he claims he didn't, and he got really sketched out about it. He was like: ""I don't know why the hammer and screwdriver are on your desk.""

I was like: ""You had them when you went downstairs. Nobody else was downstairs.""

Him: ""I really don't know why they were on your desk. I didn't do it. Why would I do that?""

Me: ""\[NAME\], I came down two minutes after you and you were in my room. You left the hammer and screwdriver in my room on my desk.""

Him: ""No I didn't. Sorry. Got the wrong guy. God, I hate it how you blame everything on me. All. The. Time. It gets old, dad.""

He was seriously, the only person who was downstairs at the time. And when he was denying it. His voice shook. His face reddened. And a gleam of sweat formed on his forehead. He was up to something in my room. I dumped my soda and went about my day.

What should I do? I want this stop. I can't ask for it stop if they're going to keep denying. Plus that'll piss off my wife. I'm just backed into a corner with this shit. I really think the kids are gumming their nighttime meds and feeding them to me and wife, so they can jerk off all night and play Fortnite.

Please help."

Occasionally we talk about serious stuff like mental health and issues they have been working through lately. Sometimes I let them vent and offer advice on problems they have since I've been through a lot of similar shit that they've been through.

I'm the kind of person who hates to leave messages unresponded to on my normal social media, so I always feel obligated to answer immediately. However, unlike all my other friends, this particular friend takes my responses (even if they're short and don't need an answer) as a sign to start talking about their day and random interests and hobbies we both have in common. Normally I don't mind this, but they've been doing it almost everyday for the past week, and I'm feeling very drained emotionally and mentally.

I've already talked to them about this once before when they kept messaging me a few months back so that they could dump their mental struggles on me. I was feeling even more exhausted than I was now because I felt like I was playing their therapist, and I finally got up the courage to gently ask for some space. Thankfully they were understanding, and they stopped messaging me as constantly as they were and things were back to normal.

They've started to do it again though, only this time they're just messaging me about random stuff they want to talk about. Again, I don't mind talking about random shit with friends, but I'm quickly starting to feel drained again and obligated to have a daily conversation with them.

I'm busy with a ton of other stuff in my life right now though (work, school, etc.). I don't have the time or mental strength required to talked to one person on the daily for several hours at a time so I'm feeling a bit frustrated.

I don't want to ignore them, but I also need a breather from my clingy friend. I'm not sure what's the best way to talk to them about it, especially since I've already talked to them about it before a few months back. I don't want to ignore them, because mostly they are a great friend. I'm just feeling overwhelmed and mentally tired from having to divide my attention up on a daily basis between this one friend and everything else going on in my life, plus my own mental health.

What's the best way to go about talking to them that's respectful but also firm about my personal boundaries?

Thanks in advance, Reddit.


TL;DR After telling a clingy friend of mine that I felt overwhelmed from our constant conversations where I basically was their personal unpaid therapist, they understood and gave me space. However, recently they've started talking to me on a daily basis again without giving me a break and I want to know the best way to tell them a 2nd time that I need space from their constant attempts at conversation."

Girl friend=G

So let's start from the beginning. My Bf has been friends with G for a while now and I on the other hand just started to get to know G better at the start of this year when (after I lost some weight and started going to the gym) when I, Bf and G went out and throughout this I've observed that she's avoiding me she doesn't want to take any pics with me while with Bf she has a TON which I don't mind but still, and the only way she will hang out is if Bf comes or someone else doesn't matter, only if it isn't only the two of us. And before you say that I just need to try to get to know her better that's exactly what I'm trying TO DO!! She just says that she doesn't want to go a date with me but I already have specified that it is not a date. I don't if know if she doesn't like me but I don't think her mom has said to my mom that G admires me because of how much weight I have lost, and my good grades (I know embarrassing) and Bf has asked her if she's avoiding me and she just said the three of us are best friend.

Ps: The three of us are teens, me and Bf are dudes and she's a girl (If it matters) and sorry if bad english ain't American"

2003,dize5a,bdjohn06,Is there a way to offer financial assistance to my sister without making her feel guilty or insulted?,"Last year a stat came out that [40% of Americans can't afford a surprise $400 expense](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/22/fed-survey-40-percent-of-adults-cant-cover-400-emergency-expense.html). My sister is firmly in that camp. She's a divorced mother of two children and a teacher in an area that pays educators poorly.

The reason I know she's in that 40% group is she recently had an emergency expense that was less that $250 and couldn't afford it. She was able to borrow money from one of our parents, but I feel like this is a bandaid for the bigger issue of actual financial security.

I'm also concerned what effect this may have in the future when her kids are looking at colleges. I don't want their academic potentials to be limited by their financial means.

I'd like to know if anyone else has been in this situation and how they approached the problem. 

What are some good ways to help a family member struggling financially? Opening a savings account or a trust?

How can I broach the subject with her such that she wouldn't feel guilty and without me being intrusive?"
2872,dequ8n,frostedflakes98,"My ex broke up with me because he has to be ""alone"" but now he's seeing someone else and says I can't be mad","My ex and I broke up recently but decided to stay friends. We're both pretty mentally ill and he said his therapist told him it's probably just best to be alone right now. I believe that because I've been told that before by therapists. He basically said he doesn't wanna keep burdening me with his depression and suicidal thoughts/tendencies. I obviously couldn't be mad at him for that. We decided to stay friends because we were friends first and we didn't wanna just cut each other out of our lives. 

That was literally 8 days ago. Tonight he's on a date with a girl that he works with. He said I have no right to be mad because we're broken up and it's not like he's cheating.

I asked him why he was seeing her if he has to be alone and he said ""the idea of being with her was always on my mind and when she asked me out I had to say yes. I'm not trying to date her yet."" 

So I told him that if he's with her, we can't be friends anymore because I can't put myself through that. I knew eventually we'd see other people but I didn't think it would happen 8 days after we broke up, and he said they've been talking for 6 days so he really wasted no time. 

Anyways after I said we couldn't be friends he got all mad. He kept saying ""you're just gonna throw all this way? You're gonna give up on me, just like that?"" Even though he's the one that ended things. I said all he had to do to keep me in his life was cancel the date tonight and he told me he couldn't do that. Then he said he doesn't know what he'd do without me and he can't give up on me but he can't give up on her either. 

I asked if he left me to be with her and he denies it but I don't know if I believe it. Everytime I get mad about it he tells me I can't be mad because we're broken up. I get what he's saying but I still feel like I have every right to be pissed and hurt and sad as hell. 

I just feel really lost and really empty. When we first broke up it was sad but I understood his reasons. It's hard to heal when you're in a relationship with someone who is also super fucked in the head. But now I'm just confused. I don't know what to do."

After a few years of marriage, they decided to start their own family which led to the birth of my half-sister. At around a year and a half years old, my half sister's father was diagnosed with stage four cancer which ultimately resulted in his death. In the present, my sister is almost twelve and my mom feels immense guilt over not spending a lot of time with her daughter. My mom is often very upset by my stepfather's death and wishes my sister had her biological father in her life. Because of this, discipline is not used and my mother is a very passive parent. My mother realizes this and is frustrated by her own guilt. However, the parenting hasn't changed and my sister is out of control. She does not listen to any form of punishment from my mom (she is usually very lenient and just takes away Netflix, when my sister still has access to Youtube, the Nintendo Switch and her tablet). Now, any punishment or discussion about problem behaviors is brushed aside. My mom is being run over and my sister throws tantrums at school and does not have many friends. What can I do in this situation? I realize my mom plays a big role and is the predominant caregiver but its heartbreaking to see this happen. I've talked to my mom about my sister receiving therapy, changing parenting methods and/or getting my sister involved in activities outside of school. I would love any respectful advice or insight."

I can talk to girls just fine and I think I can play it off as if I'm not nervous (helps if I'm drunk cause then I'm actually not nervous). But I don't know what to do besides talking. How do you show a girl that you're interested? 

When my friends ask me why I'm not even trying to hook up with girls I'll just say that it's not a priority for me, even though it's eating me inside and I wish I could be in a relationship. 

I've been on a tinder date, but it was a disaster and there wasn't a second date, I just didn't know what to talk about with her and was so nervous to the point where she actually pointed out that my hands were shaking. At this point I feel like I'm going to be alone forever.

31451,8a3ok2,BreezeRunner,Dating someone with Bipolar/Depression,"Me [19F] and my boyfriend [19M] are going through a rough patch mostly because of his mental illnesses (and also his bad company) and I'm very conflicted whether I should stay or leave.

We've known each other for 5 years now. Four years as very close friends and one dating. I always tryed to be supportive but it was uncomparably easier when we weren't dating. Now that his bad decisions actually directly affect my life too I find myself irationally annoyed when he does something totally irresponsible (skips school ALL the time, misses tests, drinks excessively at inappropriate times, is on phone all day because he hardly gathers motivation to do anything else, or is hanging around guys that are known to abuse drugs). All this affects me badly, I worry A LOT about those things, I fight urge to cry 75% of times when he's with that company. At this point it was necessary for me to seek psychologist too (But waiting line is approx. 360 days)

Nevertheless, i love that guy. When he's well he's more than I could EVER wish for. He's the best.

So my question here is - In ~ 3 months he will (hopefully:S) finish IT school he hates so much and might later actually study something that he enjoys. Also he'd be moving in with me (in 6months) in another city (~1h away with a car) so that would mean leaving his 'friends' behind. - He admited they are bad company but still hangs around with them. So should I stay in hopes of better times ... or end relationship? I blame his company for 95% of troubles we are having, but I just might be delusional and it's actually bipolar and depression causing this -meaning that even if he moves in with me nothing will/can really change and that this relationship is doomed to fail anyway.

Additional request, if I decide to stay - what can I do for him to help him? Especially when he fucks things up. I find it extremely hard to be supportive, because I want him so so much to learn from his mistakes. Plus I find it impossible to support him when he's absoultely ignoring life problems that are approaching. If I'm not constantly nagging him to do something for school he just doesn't do it till the very last day or even then not. When he 'surprisingly' fails he is even more depressed. Help :(

Tl;dr: I'm dating someone with depression and starting to feel that I can no longer support his irresponsible behaviour because it's dragging me down. Is it mistake to leave considering I still love him and will suffer very much if we break up or is it actually the only right thing to do?"
9924,ce5j4x,Vitamin-S_e_e,My dad stole my life savings (17F),"He made me get a job at the store that he owned when I was ten. He always made me put at least three ($500+) paychecks into my savings account per year.

Today I asked him if he could put my next one in there, and he had no recollection of such an account. I explained to it that we'd been putting money into it since I was born and he said that when he switched banks, he might have cancelled my account, and that he thought it probably had about $600 in it.

However, do the math with me. From ages 10-12 I only worked 5 hour days during the summer. I got paid $8 an hour and worked 5 days a week. If I put two paychecks in there each year for about $900. From ages 13-14 I worked about seven hours a day in the summer making $8 an hour. Say I put in two paychecks each year for around $500, now the account would be at $1,400. Last year I put in three paychecks all for about $600. Now the account should be at $3,200.

I asked him about this and he didn't really answer any questions.

All my life savings are gone. That was my college fund, my rent deposit, and my food for my future.

I was very recently tasked with organizing Forensics, an event in our school that is a make believe detective act with a scenario I have to design with possible evidence and people to play the part of the suspects.

The real issue here is, I can't think up a scenario with a definitive answer, each scenario I tell a friend and they tell me what they think happened, it makes sense! The crime could have happened that way too! This is what has been happening this whole week, I can't think up an interesting yet a difficult enough story for the finals of the event. This story will be the final question on which the winner will be decided, there will be a few rounds of problem solving and riddle cracking to screen participants and keep the cream of the cream to the final round, so this story should be a tough nut to crack.

Here is where you come in reddit, can you be so kind enough and help me build on a story with a crime involved? (it can be anything from murder to kidnapping but no sexual assaults please, teachers might partake in this and I want to be able to look them in the eye while listening to their class). 

It should have a definite motive, a singular perpetrator and a solid captivating storyline. I know this is asking to do my work for me, but I really can't think of no place else to go. I'll still have to design the crime scene and script the suspect's lines, so, I'm not asking you guys to do every part of my job for me, thank you very much. I hope you guys don't hate.

I should also probably mention that my friend has a tendency to make up things for a attention, so I can’t really tell what’s genuine and what’s not. They’re my best friend, I’ve known them for nearly 7 years, but we’re drifting apart as high school goes on. They’re becoming someone I don’t recognize, and I feel like I’m just being copied.

She takes nothing personally, thereby she rarely thinks anything is her fault - meaning if she was rude to you, according to her you probably deserved it. It is very difficult to be as honest with her as she is with me.

I used to have a very high sex drive and his was not as high. I used to ask him to have sex once maybe twice a day and he would turn me down a lot because he wasn’t in the mood and i was fine with that i understood. Probably around 5-6 months after giving birth for some strange reason our sex drives have completely switched and mine is very low now and his is very high. He wants to have sex a lot and i’m not in the mood a lot. When he asks and i say i’m not in the mood he gets very angry very quick and smacks his lips and says oh my god leave me alone. and i will try to talk to him and he will just be like shut the fuck up don’t touch me turn around and watch your show. We had sex this morning and then tonight he tried to initiate and i said i wasn’t in the mood and he got mad and said things like that and then grabbed his pillow and blanket to go sleep downstairs. (he sleeps downstairs on the couch because we live with my parents and they won’t let us sleep in the same bed until we are married) I tried to give him a kiss before he went downstairs even after he said all that to me and he said “i’m not in the mood” very sarcastically. I hate to even admit this but sometimes when I’m not in the mood i will have sex with him anyway to avoid conflict because if i said i wasn’t in the mood i know what would happen. I don’t want to say im not in the mood and him be mad at me but I don’t want to have sex when I don’t want to. I feel like sex is way more important to him than it should be. We have also been arguing A LOT more recently than we used to about everything. We just haven’t been getting a long well everything i say and do seems to make him angry. Our relationship now just seems to be sex and arguments. I don’t know what I should do can someone give me some advice please?

He brought his boyfriend to practice constantly which I hated. 

I really, really tried with this person but after almost 3 years I decided he had to go. I planned to drive to his house and do it in person, the right way. My drummer (who's an old friend of his) broke the news to him before I could, and that was that. I texted him and said basically ""guess you heard. I wanted to do it in person, sorry you had to hear it through the grapevine. Call me if you want to talk about it, if not I wish you the best.""

Over two weeks later, hasn't said so much as a word to me. Fine. However his boyfriend keeps leaving shitty little snarky comments on things on my personal page and the band's social media. I've never replied anything except liking the comment and leaving a winky face, then delete the commemt.

Even low-skilled fast-food jobs won't hire me because they think I will just leave as soon as something better comes due to my degree. I am in so much regret because I was offered so many other jobs that I would have preferred and done better in, but chose the Accounting because it paid a lot more. I tried to ask if the positions were still open, but they weren't. 

Where should I go from here and how do I handle the immense regret? "
25857,90m55n,repressedpomegranate,Sexual assault or something else?,"So I’ve had a few things happen to me (21f) and I’ve told people a few times before and I get mixed reactions. Like, a range of my parents telling me it was normal and if I was really upset that I should take a day and move on to My boyfriend getting so mad he punched stuff and bruised his hand up. 

I’m gonna number these so you can tell me what you think. 

1. When I was in highschool, I was kind of seeing this guy off and on. I hadn’t even kissed anyone and he knew that I wasn’t comfortable doing anything sexual. One night we were hanging out and he pulled my shirt off and was like holding my arms down and I started having a panic attack after having asked him to stop multiple times. He ended up leaving and then calling me and crying and apologizing. Stupidly, I forgave him and it happened again later. I told my parents and they told me it was an overreaction and not to cut him off. It happened a third time before I ended everything. I feel dumb for continuing to see him in hindsight but I was so confused and I was like 15.  I still don’t know if it’s a big deal or if it’s assault or what. 

2. I was hanging out with this guy and he wanted me to smoke. He was being weirdly aggressive about it (and I don’t smoke typically) so I pretended like I was inhaling it but I didn’t. He got mad and started going “I don’t understand why it isn’t working!” When I said I wasn’t high. He was being so upset and volatile about it that I just told him I was high to get him to calm down. Then he kept trying to make out with me and lay on top of me. I kept asking him to stop and he kept telling me to be quiet so we wouldn’t “bother other people”. I kept trying to get him to stop but eventually I like disconnected emotionally and I gave up and I just laid there limp for half an hour while he kept doing it. But because he didn’t actually “touch” me, I don’t know what it it’s classified as. Again, I told my mom and she told me I was overreacting. I didn’t ever hang out eith him again but he started joining clubs on campus I was in and following me to my dorm and I was scared shitless. He ended up transferring into my class and I was so scared that I would drink before class periods. I figured out that he has a girlfriend now (through mutual friends) and apparently she’s scared to leave because he hits her. 

3. My friend offered to drive me home one night after I’d had 2-3 drinks and his friend was in the car. He asked if he could run in and use the bathroom and I said that was fine. Little did I know that he’d texted the friend from the bathroom and told him I was trying to hookup and to just leave without him. After my previous two experiences I was freaking out and asking him to leave to the point of sobbing. I even tried to convince him I was “sick” from drinking (I was sober). He got me a trash can and while I forced myself to throw up (I thought it’d turn him off and he’d leave) he was dry humping me and groping me. He took my phone away and refused to leave even though I was begging him to. I told him, “you’re really scaring me and I don’t want to do anything. I have a boyfriend.” And he said, “you’re just nervous because you’ve never fu$7@: a *insert race here* guy before.” He kept groping me and whatever until I finally told him he could stay but we should go outside so I could smoke a cigarette. Once he was outside I sprinted back in and locked him out and he waited outside for another hour trying to get back in. 

These are things that have really damaged my ability to have relationships with the good guys I’ve dated as I randomly feel like I go back to those moments when I’m with someone else and I get scared and have to stop. I don’t know if I’m overreacting and it IS normal like my family has said or if it is assault and it’s something that is actually a big deal. 

Please no judgement. I know it sounds dumb that I didn’t call the police or report it or in the first case, that I continued to hang out with him after. You won’t understand that part unless you’ve been in it; I was humiliated and just wanted it to be over. I didn’t want to talk to cops who were adult men about the worst things that had ever happened to me and potentially face more judgement. "

22897,9fqtsy,miumiux,Been stuck relying on paycheck to paycheck for too long now - Please help.,"TLDR: I need help making a minimum of $5000/mo as a freelancer or content creator, but am having a hard time finding options. I'm too stressed to be creative and resourceful like I used to be. I need the advice of individuals who ideally have a mix of a corporate background and being self-employed in Canada. OR even people who work for the camgirl / fetish modeling industry, or world of digital marketing, Youtube or content creation. If you have experience in the above can you please share some advice? I WILL do FREE design work for you in exchange for your consultation and expertise if this needs a closer look. Please guys, I really would just appreciate substantial, non-generic advice.

\----

Please read with mercy and only if you have substantial advice. Even if they are crazy ambitious, I am open.

I'd like to preface this by saying I can't afford a life coach, counselor or financial coach to help me and anymore courses. I also don't have a healthy credit to apply for loans. I don't have wealthy relatives or friends to borrow from. My partner and I don't work well in full-time jobs working for someone else, which is why we became self-employed in the first place. I have nothing to sell. And lastly, moving to a ""cheaper"" apartment / living arrangement will set me back many months if I go with that option, so I can't do that. I am looking for ways to make MORE and increase performance, not be forced to ""save"" or reverse the progress I've already made so far.

I am a freelance graphic / web designer with 3 clients who I have monthly retainers from ($3000/mo). I live with a partner who is also a freelance IT who has been covering 60% of our expenses from his savings, which we were forced to use and now it has run out. We relied on the savings as he isn't working a full-time job right now, because he wanted to focus on building these elaborate crypto mining facilities that he hoped would bring us a return. With the current markets right now, we aren't doing too well so we're both very discouraged.

I have been trying to get more clients (but with no luck) because we both need a minimum of $5000/mo to cover our business and personal expenses. This is already the most conservative amount we can bring it down to. Perhaps the stress is blocking my mind from being resourceful because I can't figure a way out at all... like I really don't know what to do and don't know any other options that won't cost more $$$. It's hard to find clients that have the budget to hire me for $1000/mo. And if I take on 10+ clients at lower rates I would burn out completely. My partner is now too deeply involved in his projects to get a full-time job, and I have to figure it out for a bit longer until he finally gets back on his feet.

I am debating between the following directions... if anyone has experience can you please help me?? Even just a conversation I would be so grateful and will return the favor in some way if there's anything you need as well.

1) Start a monetized Youtube channel focused on design tutorials, and create a mailing list that I can sell my digital products and services to. (however how long will this take to do? will it be good ROI?) 

2) Start selling fetish video clips or photo sets. (I heard this works for some but I'm not sure if the revenue is actually possible within a short time?)

3) Find capital to help with operating expenses for a few more months and then also use it to fund my Amazon e-commerce business.

4) Sell drugs. (i don't even know where to start with this nor do i have the street smarts...)

\----

So guys, please??? I feel stuck and in panick. :( What's the most viable route?"
8608,cknhno,Duke_of_Lawrence,Horribly strange feeling that I need gone now.,"Yesterday I felt like being an actual real productive adult. I'm a full time student but apparently my employer doesn't get the fact that I have to go back to school 10 states away when the summer is over, so he lays me off after working for two months. This isn't the problem though. Because I wanted to do something with my time I decided to get up really early instead of sleeping in really late. I set an alarm and I got up to it just fine. 6:30 to 6:45 I was having a wonderful time just playing with my cats and doing some house work.

It was about at 6:50 I decided to make up some tea, so I put the kettle on the stove and turned the burner which I thought to be the one the kettle was on. However, it was just my luck that it would be the next one over, the one that had a large glass plate on it. Now why the fuck a glass platter in on the stove is beyond me. My girlfriend does most the cooking. She doesn't live with me in my appartment, her parents think that's unethical or something.

But back to the glass platter, after about five minutes of it being on the burner it explodes with the loudest boom I have ever heard in my life. My heart is still fluttering and this happened an hour ago. There was glass everywhere and i thought the best thing to do was to just sweep it up. So i started to do so. But while i was doing it things seemed to get scarier the more I worked.

I was seeing movement out of the corner of my eye and I swear when I moved the microwave stand, there was someone right behind me. I didn't see them, but i know they were there, I know what they looked like, but I didn't actually see them. It only got worse.

Soon I just left the glass in a large pile in the middle of the floor, my kitchen all out of place, and I just left the flat. I think there is someone in my house, and I just left it, my cats are all alone there. It may be just me but even now as I'm sitting in the park I feel terrified with every little sound, every person who walks by scares me. I'm almost 24 and I'm curled up on a park bench terrified. All that happened was a large boom of an exploding glass platter and now I'm super paranoid. I don't know if I should go home or not. I don't know what to do. I don't know if this is enough information for you all, I don't even know if you'll believe me. But I'm begging you Reddit, I really don't know what to do."
38087,7nqtv4,SomedayMightCome,Is this normal? Friends gf must come everywhere,"I (24 f) have known my friend (23m) since 8th grade. We became friends in hs and remained friends throughout college. I am gay and thus have no interest in him romantically. 

Since he started dating his gf every single time I ask him to hangout he invites her as well. She's very nice and I don't mind her as a person but I have nothing in common with her and I don't really feel the need to hangout with her. We have very different interests/jobs/lives and I often find myself not having anything to talk about with her 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

He'll ask if it's ok if she joins and I usually say yes because I don't want to be rude. 

Is it normal for a male friend to bring his gf that I barely know everywhere? They live together and I understand some women being concerned about their bf having female friends but she knows I am very gay. I feel like his gf is chaperoning us and it's a little awkward. 

Is it out of bounds to want to hangout with my friend alone without his gf? 

Like they live together and spend every day together so I don't feel like I'm intruding on couple time?"
26266,8ygjyi,dayoungone,I think someone is living in my house.,"My mom usually works all day so it's mainly just me, and my dad around the house. Earlier today my dad came in asking if i was running around, because he apparently heard someone running up and down the stairs and opening doors. I wasn't even awake. He said that doors he closed were now open and he had to close them again. It's scary to think someone might've came in my room since my door was wide open.

My dad also complained about some of his cool whip going missing. Nobody in the household likes that so that's pretty strange.

A few months ago i was home alone and i heard someone running down the stairs and going through the kitchen. I called my dad and when he arrived he found that it was the balloons making the noise in the kitchen... This explained the kitchen but not the footsteps going down the stairs. I let it go since i figured i probably was hallucinating. 

One of my dads friends also heard a woman's voice when he was here that was unaccounted for.

Spooky shit. My parent's aren't big on the police but if this is some Jeffrey Dahmer shit i wanna be prepared. So far i have a knife under my pillow, keep my door locked and stay up till morning to see if i can hear anything. I'm gonna count the silverware and pieces of bread. 

Any ideas for how i could see if someone really is in this house, or ways to catch. Any tactics? Strategies? I'm all ears."
6588,cunk55,lacsquirt,Should I report my bestfriend's parents for negligence?,"My bestfriend's brother dropped out of elementary school when he was 8. He is now 13. His parents marked him as homeschooled, but all he does is play video games all day. He's 4-5 years behind his fellow peers, lacks in communication skills, and hasn't been able to mature throughtout the years as he should.

I know that he isn't related to me, but I'm concerned because it feels like his parents are setting him up for failure by not forcing or letting him get the proper education he needs. The amount of screen time he is allowed is also excessively unhealthy. I'm worried about his future, and I do not want him to grow up depending on my bestfriend like the family already does now since she's the only one going to college and trying to get a decent paying job.

I'm afraid that if I report the family, it would ruin the relationship with my bestfriend. However, I don't want my bestfriend to have to parent her brother with a 2nd grade educate only because he was too lazy to put in the work himself. I also don't want to see her brother in thar situation. He's capable of doing the work, he just chooses not to. The parents do not care either. One of them doesn't even work.

I'm just wondering if I should try and intervene or just keep out of the family's business."

.  
  So I'd like to get her a really really nice present that doesn't involve princesses. Unicorns, sure.  
See, I got her brother a Nintendo Switch, and I'd like to keep it fair price wise.  
What would you guys recommend?  
Her mom already takes her to a salon. She likes animals and stuffed animals, but her mom says she has too many. I tried legos and robots for xmas, but she likes coloring more.  
I really don't wanna just dump a gift card in her lap.  
  
Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!"
1474,dlj1jd,HerrGeorg,"I'm a 19 yo boy and I can marry a guy to legally save money from tuition, should I do it?","I am an Eastern European university student in the Netherlands, my first year. My tuition is 2000 euros (11 000 for non EU citizens, this will be important in a bit), since I'm from an EU country. Life here costs about double what it does back home, since rent is disgustingly high (I cannot study what I am back home), which puts some financial strain on my parents, but nothing life changing though. I cannot start work yet, because studying is way too overwhelming by itself as it is, I will the moment I can afford to. Except from spending wisely, I think I can also save money in one other way. 

There is that one non EU guy who discovered that if he married an EU citizen, his tuition would go down to 2000 euros. So, he's searching preferably for a girl to marry and give some money to from the 9000 euros he would save. Should I marry him if we strike a deal and have him give me a portion of the money he would save from tuition? Of course, if someone (parents) or something gets in the way, I will probably immediately back down on doing such a thing, since I'm pretty sure it is fraud. The idea looks cool, but immensely stupid. Should I try to follow with it? And what are problems you immediately spot with it? Also, I don't care that it can be seen by whoever (the social consequences), except employers, would that potentially be an issue with them, both back home and here? 

Thank you for any advice you leave :)"
38144,7nkv40,lovablepanda04,I’ve been tutoring a little boy and I don’t know if he’s joking about killing himself.,"I’ve been volunteering through a program for children who are at-risks or falling behind in elementary school. I’m currently tutoring a little boy and he would always talk about killing and harming himself. I told the person in charge of the program and he told me not to worry because his previous teachers said he’s a trouble maker who likes to make jokes. The thing is.. I don’t know if he’s joking. I asked him to pick a book and he couldn’t choose one, so I picked a random one and he told me “not that one.” I asked him why not and he said his brother hit him with that book many times. He talked about killing himself and how he’s being bullied in school. Again, I told the person in charge, but they said there’s nothing going on at home. They had a conference with his parents, and everything seems all right at home. He continues to talk about how he’s going to kill himself and how life sucks. Whenever I tell the person in charge, they would ask the child and he would say “I’m just joking”, so no one is doing anything about it. Am I reading too much into this? What should I do? I don’t think it’s normal for a third grader to talk about killing himself so often."

26886,8v3omm,CasuallyInsecureMan,"I’ve wanted to be a musician my entire life, and after my first year at college, I’m beginning to question my decision","I’m not sure how long this will be, I’m sorry if it’s too long.

Basically, I’ve always been a talented musician, and music will always be a part of my life. However, I’m starting to question my decision, because becoming a musician (for any reason outside of being a teacher) can be a very risky career in many ways.

I made a mistake on my college application after I graduated from high school and opted to go to my local community college instead of an expensive, high-end music conservatory. This might have been the best mistake I’ve ever made in my life. I never knew how incomplete of a musician I was until I came here, and my current piano teacher is trying to fix me in every way he can. 

I would like to mention that my questioning has nothing to do with doubts about my musical ability, because I am super fortunate talent-wise. I just don’t think it’s smart to pursue a degree in music composition. Because of this, I have been losing motivation to practice.

As for other careers, something I have always been interested in is metoerology. That would probably be my second choice as for my profession. Some other options would be a geographer, a contractor, or even a designer.

The only person I’ve told was my significant other, and I’m afraid to bring it up to my parents until I’ve thought about it for enough time. Can you guys give me any advice about ways I can make a desicion or talk about it with others? Is it too late to switch?

I would be open to teaching piano part time to young students if I did choose a different career.

TL;DR: I am currently pursuing a degree at my local community college, but I’m questioning becoming a musician rather than something else interesting to me; metoerology."

Anyways, I’m an American 16 year old male that goes to a public school. Yesterday my friends mom invited me over to go hang out with my friend, let’s call him Delta. Me and Delta are good friends, when we usually hang out, we play xbox together because I have 2 consoles. But when I went over his house this time, he wasn’t home. It was just his mom, which was weird because why would his mom invite me over to play video games if he wasn’t home? His mom said that he would be home. I sat on his couch waiting for around 15 minutes. His mom then asked if I needed anything, to drink or eat. I said no. She then took me to her bedroom to “help” her. When I got in she sat down on the bed, she kept rubbing my arm and touching my thighs and telling me how handsome I was and how warm I am. I’m not gonna lie, I did get a boner from this. She was pretty young, about 32 years old. She started stripping and taking off her pants and shirt leaving her bra and panties. My eyes where really wide, I didn’t even know this was happening. She asked me if she thought I was pretty, I sat there, wide eyed without an answer. She told me to touch her breasts and took my hands and rubbed them against them. Keep in mind I wasn’t a virgin, I already lost my virginity. I was super hard at this point. And when she knew this, she took off her top and just her top, she told me that I should not tell anyone about this. She then told me to take my clothes off. And I fucking did. It was super awkward for me but she was super turned on. I took my clothes off and she then tried taking off my underwear and I refused. She said it would be ok if I didn’t tell anyone because she wouldn’t ever speak of this again. I let her take it off and we had unprotected sex, and I reached climax too. She said she would take her pills but I don’t know if she actually did. I got home not knowing what to do so here I am. Can someone please tell me what to do? Should I keep silent?

34734,7ytlhz,caud3x,"This is super strange, but I'm disgusted by stuff like makeup and need help","I'm a straight guy (on reddit no less), and I want to get married and have kids one day. 

Problem is, I'm disgusted by makeup (mostly lip stick/gloss, I can deal with a bit of eye or face makeup), piercings (including ear), and nail polish. I have been ever since I was a little kid (I have a distinct recollection of being 5 years old and feeling really grossed out by my mom putting on makeup). I have no idea why I'm like this, but I can give the reasons why I feel like this.

Basically the reason for me finding makeup gross boils down to what happens to it. With lipstick/gloss, the woman using it is basically eating it over the course of the day, which I find pretty gross since it's made of a bunch of chemicals, and if I kissed them then I'd eat some too. I'd bet that if you saw someone take a bite out of a lipstick that'd be pretty revolting and it seems to me like using lipstick/gloss is basically the same thing on a smaller scale.

Nail polish is similar, since I've seen chips of it come off into food and stuff. It's not as big of an issue for me though.

Piercings are probably what I have the most trouble with. It's sticking metal through your effing skin, I fail to see how everyone just goes along with it lol.

Obviously, you can see why this is a huge problem. I have one semi-friend who's a woman and whenever she wears earrings or makeup I just feel grossed out, obviously I realize it's silly so I do my best to overcome it, but in my current state there's no way I could be in a relationship unless I find someone who doesn't use and won't use these things in the future, and it seems pretty unlikely that I'd happen upon someone like that.

I really have no idea what to do, and I can't afford professional help. Please help me reddit"
10706,ca6avv,Llamain2hats,How can I make my parents understand I dont want to visit them literally every single weekend and/or holiday (without destroying our relationship)?,"I dont want to crush my parents but... I am 21, living away with my bf for more than 2 years now and studying in the same town (taking NO money from my parents). 

At first I broke off the contact (without getting into details, I moved out bc I coudnt mentally handle living with them anymore), then we formed a tentative truce and now we actually have better contact than ever. We talk more than we did through all of my teenage years and rarely fight. The only downside is, they cant seem to comprehend that spending time with them doesnt count as *free* time for me.

It's pleasant to meet with them now but it still requires a certain level of effort from me and my boyfriend to ""handle"" them. And, like everyone, after a long working week we want to relax. But we cant because we have to spend at least one full day at their place (which often is my ONLY free day). Things get especially tense when my boyfriend wants to go to his family with me (their entire family is a VERY tight knit italian family, they dont expect weekly visits but it is huge and everyone wants to see us once in a while so they visit or we visit them). 

Whenever I say that I cant visit my parents bc we are going to X part of boyfriend's family they say ""so visit as by yourself"" or ""you can visit us before you go"" or ""but you have Sunday off too this week, you can spend it with us!"" Which yeah, I can but I DONT WANT TO. I am an introvert and want at least one day to be a Stay At Home day, not a Drive Across Town day. And when I try the ""i have housework"" excuse they say ""well you can do it after work during the week, you have time"". 

I just... How can I make them understand that I need free time too and that they already spend more time with me and my bf than his family with him (and they dont complain!!! Ever!!!)? Every time I try to have that conversation they go all ""so you dont want to see us? We love you how can you do this to us???? We just want to spend time with you!!"" And i feel so guilty (and my boyfriend gets mad because well, he is right, he is not seeing his family as often as he sees mine so when they do this I can barely restrain him to not tell them off). 

It puts a strain on my relationship with my parents, my boyfriend and even sometimes his family (bc during any holiday they both want me there and I cant split in two and please both) 

Please help me handle this in a way that doesnt end in a huge fight and my guilty conscience. We (me and my p) worked really hard to repair our non-existant relationship and I appreciate their effort (that was non existent before) but this is way too much for me to handle."

I couldn't complete college because of family turning their back on me and me becoming homeless. That led to having trouble with my job and on top of school debt I was not able to keep up with my non related school loans. 

I work at a dead end job but even being the full time assistant manager I cannot afford to live on my own. I have great skills on computers and software development but in my area of the US there are no jobs relating to that field around. I also know nobody in that field and since I couldn't complete my degree I don't have the piece of paper proving my skills. 

I have tried to develop apps on the Google play store and have couple on there but one was mostly a test and the other is incomplete and even though me and my long time friend plan to complete it years have passed and nothing has been done mostly due to our situation. 

I have wanted to dropship and had a successful night of that but since I owe paypal money I was unable to fulfill that order and lost the money. Since I have no investment money I cannot afford to continue on any other platform.

I want to do e-commerce and be an entreprenuer but since I have no money to invest it Is impossible. Where I live now I am going to have to move in a couple months which I have no idea what I will do. 

The only option I see avaliable is truck driving and it's something that I really don't want to do. I'm so sick of hating my life everyday. Suicide runs through my mind at least twice a week. 

I know there's no get rich quick schemes out there and there's no magical way to solve these problems but at this point I'm just lost and all my motivation is gone. I've tried so hard to only be pushed down further by friends and family.

I've copied and pasted below a previous post of mine.

&gt; I applied through clearing to a university I did limited research into, which was admittedly my first mistake. I'll accept that.

&gt; I've yet to still withdraw my choice from clearing and withdraw my application fully. And no, I don't think I want to defer it.

&gt; I did this due to the fact that I felt like I absolutely had to. Throughout the entirety of my A-Level experience, we were shoved down the university path. 3/4 of PD lessons were about university, how you'd essentially fail without a degree, etc. While the other 1/4 focused on alternatives, these presentations were often rushed, half-assed. All in all, I felt like I absolutely had to go university, despite not being academic, otherwise I'd be regarded as inferior, and that's always been one of my biggest downfalls: how others perceive me.

&gt; Well, I made a split decision and decided to take a gap year to think about it. Perhaps I'll save up enough to travel, maybe do some volunteering. Although deep down this feels right, there's another part of me that's screaming, ""You're a failure! You're just scared! You're not capable,"" and all that fun stuff. I emailed my Head of Sixth Form last night and was, I shit you not, terrified I'd be berated. They've yet to get back to me.

&gt; The thing is, I'm struggling to find decent jobs. I'm struggling to think of how I can utilise this year to my advantage, given that I'm financially struggling and cannot afford to go backpacking across Australia. I did think about it, really, but everything just feels empty, as cliched as that may sound. A part of me for some reason feels disappointed, though I'm not sure why. What bothers me the most is the fact that I did alright throughout my A-Levels, given the circumstances, so I've no reason to be disappointed?

&gt; Perhaps I'll pursue an apprenticeship next year. It's just, university just doesn't feel right intuitively. I've also no friends, and so I'm struggling to cope with the inevitable loneliness as well.

&gt; If people could share some insight I'd be really appreciative.

&gt; Thanks in advance.

I feel so utterly hopeless, and as though I've failed. One of the reasons I wanted to take a year off was so I could focus on my mental health, given that I've intermittently experienced suicidal thoughts. They're amplified tenfold now, due to this potential disappointment I've bought to my teachers and family. 

I can't help but feel like I'll never get to experience great things due to opting for a gap year/potentially not going to university. It was always a vision of mine, but never one that felt right, or one that felt very idealised and romanticised. 

If anyone could perhaps offer advice/insight, as well as (affordable) things to do during a gap year,that would be terrific."
30620,8crzys,Escamilla16,Feeling scared about going on an exchange year even though I really want to go.,"I’m going on an exchange year to Germany on September 2018 to do my last year of high school. I’ve always wanted to go on exchange since 8th grade or when I was 12, finally this year I got the opportunity to go. My problem is that I’m scared of going, sometimes I feel happy and hopeful about it and other times I get sad because I’ll be leaving my family and going to live somewhere that is 10,000 km away from my family. I want to go because my life currently sucks at my school, I have no friends and I’m lonely all the time, I do have some friends outside of school though. I want to go because I don’t like much my life here and because I want to force myself out of my comfort zone (being all the day in my room watching Netflix and playing video games for example). When watching videos on YouTube about people that went on exchange I get excited and happy about doing it, but just recently I watched a video from when they get from their house to the airport and when they say goodbye to their family and I got very sad and scared of doing it, saying goodbye to all my family and going completely alone. I still want to do it and I’m very excited and I really want to go but I just have these moments when sadness comes. 

What should I do and what would you do? If you ever went on an exchange year tell me how was it?

Thank you"

For future girls, what is the best way to let them know I really don’t like texting and I’d rather talk face to face without seeming like a asshole and making them loose interest in me?"

So, I got a date with a girl by changing my messages from a sort of nice guy style to a Moreno unavailable and sort of assertive way. It got me a date. 

In the past I’ve been sort of a push over and a nice guy saying I’m free whenever you are and it’s got me no where. I started off in this way with this girl and it wasn’t going anywhere, then I changed my style to be more assertive and it got me a date. What’s the deal with this

But now I'm here at college and I'm out of my depth, I'm not smart enough to keep up and I feel like I'm just wasting my parent's money. I'll finish this year for sure, because I'm stuck in lease and student loans agreement but what should I do after that? I'd be fine with working something menial for a while but if I get stuck doing something I hate long term I don't think I'd have the willpower to not off myself. I also don't want my parents to think I'm flat out giving up, and I'm the oldest so I would absolutely hate myself if I set a negative precedent for my younger siblings."
39359,7jylia,BumpkinBed,Help With Home Life,"I don't normally ask for advice on these types of things but the only thing I have gotten from people around me is to just avoid the situation and I want to know if there's a better option.

I'm 17 years old and living at home with my father. I'm finishing high school online and I have a job that I work about 20 hours a week at. A few months ago my 21 year old decided to move his girlfriend into our house. He's living at home because of some issues in life he's had. Our house is relatively small but we all have our own bedrooms but there's not a whole lot of space and it's easy to hear things throughout the house. I barely know the girlfriend as she won't speak to me unless she wants something from me. The main problem I'm having is she bitches and moans about everything going on and she acts very entitled despite not paying rent, paying for food, having a job, doing any chores, or contributing whatsoever to the overall wellness of the house and family. I keep a little bit of an off sleeping schedule since I work in the afternoon so I usually go to bed around midnight. I was talking moderately loud to one of my friends at about 10:30 at night which doesn't even happen often, whe my brother wanted to talk to me about something for a minute. So I start talking to him and she storms out of her room bitching about how it's so late at night and she has a class early tomorrow morning and how everyone is so disrespectful to her and that I'm being hostile towards her for talking to my friend so late at night despite previous nights of her staying up until 3 am watching netflix I was just somehow supposed to know that she had a class the next day and to keep quiet. She won't just calmly talk to me its always screaming and bitching generally throughout the house.

Point is she very loudly complains about my habits and what I do (That was just one example) despite the fact that she lives here for free and does nothing. I've talked to both my dad and brother about it but no one seems to care and I'm at a loss at what I should even do besides not be home as often as possible. I just really think it's unjust to think that I should accomidate her needs despite her being considered the ""guest"""
4930,d46vvy,Justman10,"My best friends ex was one of my good friends and ever since they broke up, he doesn’t want me to see her ever again. Now he won’t talk to me since I invited her to my 21st birthday celebration","I’ve known my best friend for about 8 years or so and in that time, he’s had 3 serious relationships. Generally whenever he dates girls, they’re pretty cool and we all usually hang out with each other so I get kind of close with them also. After he broke up with the first girl, I was still friends with her and a few of her other friends after the relationship and he didn’t have any problem with it. I didn’t really know his second girlfriend but now he just came off of about a 2 year relationship with his most recent girlfriend. In that time, we hung out a lot and she actually became my best friend that was a girl. I want to note we have NEVER been sexual with each other and it has always been very platonic between us. But I mean she dates my best friend and she’s a lot a like him so we always got along together. They broke up last year for a few months and I continued to hang out with her and her friends until she ended up getting back together with my best friend. They continued to date for about another year but they just broke up about a month ago and this seems to be the final breakup between them. 

After this breakup my best friend asked me to stop hanging out with her and I agreed with him and I haven’t talked to her since their breakup. Well last night was my 21st birthday and I do have a girlfriend of my girlfriend of my own and my friends ex reached out to my girlfriend a few days ago asking about what she should get me for my birthday and she was kind of wondering why she hadn’t been invited to my birthday since we have been such close friends before. My girlfriend kind of told her that it was nothing against her but that I was keeping my distance due to my loyalty to my best friend and she seemed to understand. Well yesterday my best friends ex wished me a happy birthday and I felt bad so I told her that she could come out and celebrate with us. My best friend is out of town for college so he wasn’t able to make my birthday but I told him that his ex is gonna come out with us for my birthday celebration and he flipped out on me for always being friends with his exes and that he was tired of it. I told him that I still wasn’t seeing his ex but since it was my birthday celebration I thought it’d be okay if she came out with our group and that it’s not like I’m just hanging out with her but he hasn’t responded to me since and I feel like I’m in the wrong but just because they broke up shouldn’t mean I should automatically hate her and not be her friend anymore either. I thought it’d be fine if she just came to my birthday celebration since it’d be a big group but I wasn’t expecting my best friend to get so mad at me about it and I’m not sure what to do. 

TL;DR: My best friend has been dating a girl for 2 years and she became one of my best friends in the time of us all hanging out. Since they’re breakup a month ago, my friend wanted me to stop hanging out with her. I respected that but She’s still my friend and she seemed hurt I haven’t spoken to her since the breakup so I invited her to join my group for my 21st birthday celebration and now my best friend hasn’t talked to me."
31781,88ka1h,Taylork64,My girlfriend and I just made some huge life decisions. Advice/Feedback?,"So me and my girlfriend meet 3 years ago.  I'm 21 and she's 20. We live in NC. We absolutely love eachother. We moved in to an apartment together a year ago and it's great. We kinda did it to determine if we would be able to live together and still love each other and be happy. And it was successful. We keep joking about getting married, saying ""So when are we gonna get married?"" And we occasionally seriously discuss it from time to time.

I work as a door to door sales rep for Spectrum, and she works at Walmart. Our jobs barely allows us to pay bills and have just enough leftover for a few other things like gas food, and minor personal purchases. At this pace, we won't get anywhere in life and we want to do something. We only have one life. So we've been thinking about our future for the past couple of months, and we've came to a decision. We want to be well off in life obviously. But we want to do the things we enjoy and make a lot of money. We want a nice decent size 2 story house, with a yard, nice neighborhood, decent cars etc. Nothing fancy, but well off. Upper middle class. 

We know it'll take time and effort to get there, but we need to do something now. We decided to go to Appalachian State University. There, I'll study Computer Science, and she wants to study molecular biology. Both of those things are our passion and the careers can pay well. What we have to do is go to a community college to get 30 credit hours and we can transfer and finish our degrees in 3 years at Appalachian. I already have 19 credit hours, so I only have to take a semester more. She has to take 2 full semesters. I'll have to pay all the bills while she's going to school at community college. And when we go to Appalachian, we're going to move into a cheap apartment at the campus together. 

As for how we're going to afford it, we should be able to. We have no money and no parents to give us money, but we've been talking to financial aid, and we should be able to qualify for many grants, FAFSA, and more if we're married, so we plan to get married before we apply in January. It's something that we both want to do and now seems like the best time. 

The total cost of everything a year at Appalachian is $19,000. IF you needed everything including transportation, personal items, etc. We have 1 car, and personal items, so that amount should be lowered a little bit. We can get loans up to 12,500 if we're married, and they said they should be able to cover the gap with grants. So we would be in debt a bit, but as long as we're working in the fields we want, we'll be able to pay them off. 

I want to be a programmer or software engineer, and they usually start off at 60,000 a year and her field is about the same. Depending on the job, some companies start off at 80k-100k. But I'm going to estimate based off the lowest I think I'll make. So we'll be making 100k a year combined to start off at most likely. 

The only problem we're facing is car payment and insurance. Our car payment, insurance, and phone bill is about $580 combined monthly. I'm not sure how we're going to pay that while we're full time students. We want to put 100% focus and effort into school, but I guess we'll have to get part time jobs to pay it.

What do you guys think about this plan? Any and all feedback and suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you."

21894,9j4myx,oknotsoserious,"Confessed to my Best friend, now in a dilemma.","I've been friends with a girl for long time, but around year back, we became more close as our conversations grew. We became best friends. During that period, I helped her a lot in her tough times of loss of her parent. All this happened only through social media apps and calls. I was available to her almost 24x7. She lives in my hometown and we met only 2-3 times in past year as I'm studying away at different place. I made her my priority so she shouldn't feel sad as she was suffering through the trauma of loss of her parent. Around 5-6 months ago, I fell for her. I tried to distance myself from her many times so that I don't get attached to her and ruin everything, but somehow she talked to me always and we became normal. I gave absurd reasons for not talking rather than telling her why I did it. She used to talk about her parent and I used to think she's still in that trauma so I never confessed my feelings. I was afraid to confess as I thought she will think I was just helping her to make a move. During last 2 months though she began acting weird. Earlier she used to reply ASAP but then replies became slower. She used to say how busy she was and all other things. And suddenly few days ago she told me she got in a relationship with a guy. She had told me about her past experiences with other guys as she considered me her best friend, but this time, I didn't even had a clue. She never told me she was seeing a guy or anything about him. When I asked how it all happened, she said it just happened. I was heartbroken. I confessed my feelings when she told me she got in relationship, she said I respect your feelings but I don't feel the same and I can't do anything. She said you're still my best friend though, there's nothing awkward and its all fine. I didn't feel good though. I didn't contact her for week after that, but she talked nicely after when we talked after a week. I'm confused. She's the person with whom I have been closest yet. I got attached to her.

Should I remain friends with her or should I go away from her? "
19459,b1cif1,CherrySimulation,I wanna get my life together.,"I’m 19F with nothing really going for me. I grew up with a few mental disorders that lead me to being suicidal and I never really had a plan for my life or what I have actually ever wanted to do with myself. Recently I’ve been trying to find the strength to strive and want to live a good life that’ll last me until I retire but I’ve always been mentally held back by everything. 

I don’t know how to drive, my only job ever lasted a week because of some physical issues and neglect from my boss, my family has always struggled with money so I can’t be set off of that. I feel like my main problem is motivating myself to do things that are absolutely necessary. 

But I’d like to know where or how to start living for myself and working toward being a normal person who can make an okay living and I’d like tips from anyone who can offer some help to my situation here. 

If it helps at all, I have been to therapy and since it has somewhat helped me get better and I’d like to go down the same course so I can help other people in any way I can. "
9932,ce2drw,dayley28,Might sound stupid but how do you get over the anxiety of posting on Instagram?,"I feel so stupid, feel like people I know would judge me and laugh and say I’m trying to ‘fit in’ when really I just want to post pictures of myself out of my own accord. I just can’t find the courage."
33813,81zgiy,UnlikeableSausage,Should I take some distance?,"Okay, let me first contextualize a little. I am a 22 y/o guy who recently got in my university's program of buddy partners for international exchange students. I was assigned a girl from an European country and I live in a Latin American country. Since she came here we started hanging out a lot and we became really close, going as far as telling each other stuff we had never told other people. She has a boyfriend, with whom she's been with for like 6 years and now they even live and have a dog together back at home (which for me sounds like a huge commitment because dogs are the coolest thing in life). Her boyfriend is also going to do an exchange semester, but due to being from different majors and all that, they couldn't go to the same country. I guess I have really developed feelings for her but I also don't think anything would happen because, even though since she came here they've had some fights, she really loves him and I think it goes both ways and to be honest, I wouldn't want to be the guy who destroyed a 6 year relationship and made a dog sad. Another thing I think is important for the story is that she can be REALLY naive and won't notice when people are hitting on her, because she thinks they are just being nice, until they literally ask her if they can kiss her or stuff like that, at which point she will tell me that I was right. She also really likes it here because dancing is much more common than in her country and we would go out and hang out just the two of us until really late all the time. We are so close people would annoy us all the time about us being a couple, because to be fair, we could be as close as one sometimes.

Okay, a new player who I'll just call John comes into the scene. I think he might be a nice guy, he is also not an international and after a couple of times he starts talking a lot to my buddy partner and her roomie, but to be honest I could see he was really into her and I chose not to say anything, but truth is I was kind of jealous because she started to hang out more and more with him and less and less with me. Fast forward to last week, we were at a club with all the internationals, dancing and having fun and all that lame stuff. After a while people start telling me I shouldn't let John win her over because they had been dancing for a while really close, because everyone but her noticed he was hitting on her and they would tell me. Until that point I was having a lot of fun and to be honest I was already drunk. When people started telling me all that and I saw them, I got jealous and kind of mad so I wanted to go home. When I was about to go home, she came out and asked me what was wrong but I did not want to talk, so I told her that it was nothing and got into the cab (which charged me more than he promised because I was drunk, angry and sad and taxi drivers here are huge asshole nobody likes and we don't have taxi-meters, can you believe how behind we are?), because I really didn't want to make a scene there. I know I shouldn't have acted like that because we're nothing but good friends but being drunk and people telling me all that stuff didn't really help. She writes to me instantly asking what the matter was and I got a little too honest and I told her that I didn't want her to lie to me telling me that she cared for her boyfriend and then just playing along with that John guy. She then talked to him and asked him if he was hitting on her, to which he basically answered that if she did answered positively to his flirting, he would try more stuff, and she told me she left things clear with him about not wanting anything else than friendship, to which John made her promise that if he didn't try anything their friendship would not change. She then went to my place at like 4 in the morning so we could talk and leave things clear. At the same time all this was happening her boyfriend was really mad at her because he thought it wasn't nice that she hanged out so much with me or John alone. After we talked, I thought things would be okay again.

They weren't. That week she basically evaded me as much as she could, and when she told me to hang out things felt really weird from both sides. I felt she would really hang out with him even more and less with me, to which she said that it was bound to happen because we used to do everything together, which I didn't really like but kinda understood. I wasn't really acting in the best way and I was being kind of obsessive and insisting a lot, that much I accept. Because of this she would tell me maybe we should take some time because it might help me. To me that felt like she was the one who needed the time, so I asked her many times if she did, to which she finally admitted she wanted it because the drama we were going through did not feel like a friendship but for something stronger. So, yesterday, after she finally accepted she wanted some time, I conceded, we decided to do that. But as life really loves putting me in awkward situations, we ran into each other the same night after the day we decided to get some distance and she was with John. At the beginning I felt really weird and awkward and she came to say hi and wanted to talk like nothing had happened because ""why make things more awkward"", but I didn't really feel like it so we basically evaded each other even more. And the same thing happened. Everyone noticed how much he was hitting on her and how he would try to get her alone every oportunity he got.

Now it's the day after and I still have a lot of mixed feelings about it. I really care about her and I know she cares about me too, but when she writes to me after some time, I don't know what I should do or how I should react. Should I just act like everything is fine or should I tell her all that I think would happen with she and her boyfriend or that John guy?

Right now I also feel I would like a little distance myself, because I think John will try to get into her pants soon, and I don't know how she will react, but after that I know shit's gonna go down with her and her boyfriend or things will get awkward between her and John. I really don't want to be the 'I told you so' guy so I feel like I should just step aside. By now I feel a lot like just a guy to fall back to when something happens and I really don't like that feeling. I also think our friendship won't be able to go back to what it was before and I don't think it will heal, at least for some time.

So, what should I do? Should I do as I said or should I act differently?

TL;DR: I am a guy who met a female exchange student that I really care about now. She has a very long and committed relationship. She met John. John wants to get into her pants. She's too naive to realize and thinks I just hate the guy. I don't want to lose our friendship, but I also don't want to be involved in the drama when shit goes down.

P.D: I'm sorry for the terrible writing, but English isn't my first language and I wanted to vent, because writing and complaining to strangers on the internet is kind of therapeutic to me."
26472,8x9nmr,B1dz,"27 year old Male, lost with alot to loose","TLDR: moved towns started a new life. Built a house, partner wants to travel and drop everything we've worked for. And I'm only halfway through my education.  I bought an engagement ring too! Halp!


How do I even begin to explain my situation?

I guess I'll give a bit of backstory and jump to where it all started going sideways:
About 2 years ago my partner and I left the big City for an adventure, we sold everything packed up the car and went of a 2 month tour around our country (New Zealand)

We settled in a small town just outside of a major holiday/skiing/tourist town. Got part time jobs and tried to enjoy life.

We saw massive potential to start a fresh life, I started a new career as an electrician and my partner got a job as a graphic designer, which turned into a  job from hell for her with the devil incarnate running the show. After a few months of searching we bought some land and built our first home 1 year after arriving.(this was about an hour's drive from our places of work)


This is where things started going sideways, My partner quits her job to work account management for a local business, as her old job was to much in the end. things go crazy with our house build, it gets dragged out, and it's still not finished nearly 8 months after the ""due date,"" Anyway her new job turns for the worst as she's required to work 7 days a week sometimes 10 hours a day to stay on top of her workload.fortunately this is only 3 months of the year. during her off season she tried to follow one of her dreams and start a business which ended in disaster when one of her competitors threatened legal action.


While all this is going on I'm struggling through an apprenticeship trying to keep my sanity working 42 hours a week driving 10-12 hours a week, (we share a car) working on the house(landscaping) during my weekends and trying support my partner who feels like her life is about to implode on itself. 
We're struggling to make friends as well as we feel isolated.

Basically I feel like we've gone all in and burned ourselves out. We want to travel more than anything, which I think was the driving force behind this move. Now I'm half way through an apprenticeship, a house not quite over the line and a girlfriend (soon to be fiancee, I bought a bloody ring) who's loosing the will to live this life we live. She's heavily leaning towards traveling. With or without me, I'm lost.

I went on two dates with her, but after the second one, she stopped texting me. She would act distant and uninterested. I remained friends with her, but I took it as something happened to make her lose interest, so I focused my efforts elsewhere. A month after that I ended up finding out from an outside source that she never lost interest, so I began talking to her again and scheduled another date. We planned a lunch together on a Thursday. Until that Thursday, we talked rapidly again, and things seemed to be as they used to. Once Thursday came I decided I didn't want to waste this opportunity, so after the lunch was done, I asked if she wanted to actually start a relationship.

Basically, I used to be such a happy guy. When I was 18 and up until I was about 23, I was so carefree and smiled all the time. If someone talked down to me or had any negative things to say to me at all, I brushed it off with ease and a smile. Never thought twice about it. I used to be the guy everyone was just happy to see. I was helpful to all my friends and coworkers whenever they needed me. I used to have such big plans for myself and saw my future as something prosperous. I lived happily.

Fast forward to me now (24M) and I’m just so angry all the time. Life isn’t what I wanted it to be for myself at this point. I’m constantly upset about things at work and get easily frustrated when somebody challenges me and am so quick to argue if I think I’m right on a subject. My girlfriend and I argue a lot because I’m insensitive to how she feels about a lot of things and I drink a lot now. I constantly think bad things will happen to me and don’t call my friends anymore. I am just mad all the time. I feel like I’m a POS and deserve nothing. I can’t find happiness anymore and it’s killing me.

I constantly tell myself I want to be who I once was. The happy guy who just made everyone else around me happy. I hate that I’ve turned into an ass over the past few years. I don’t know what actually triggered it but I just hate myself now. I hate what I’ve become but can’t seem to feel any better or any more hopeful like I once was...

I really want to be happy again. Should I see a therapist? Should I read self help books?

Please, I just need some help. I hate myself now and fear I will lose everyone I love if I stay this way. What should I do reddit? "
20704,av05gx,ERArcher,What to do if you think your boss and a coworker are sleeping together?,"Now, I'm not the type to give two fu**s about other people relationships, but this is having an effect on everyones workload. 

Shes started slacking off and getting away with it, she'll disappear for an hour only to come back for 15-30 and disappear again. Continuously throughout the day. 

Yesterday she disappeared for an hour to ""help someone"" and my boss knew about it but instead of reprimanding her all he said was ""ehh at least that person appreciated the help."" 

70% percent of the work day you'll find her sitting on her phone and standing around talking, and the boss doesnt say anything about it. 

I havent personally seen them ""in the act"" but The boss clearly has a huge sweet spot for her(continuously helping her keep up, talking, etc.) , and there are rumors that they're shagging. 

She also treats everyone like trash and talks down to  all of my coworkers, and that shit needs to stop ASAP.

14995,bp5wuv,kella378,"I am a C.O. in my local county jail. For years, I have kept notes in my personal calendar book (both in the book and on papers tucked away in it) about things that happened and/or said that were inappropriate as well as info I felt necessary to remember should I need to reference it accurately.","Some of the information included the continued sexual harassment by one of supervisors in particular. One night, I was taken off the block I was working to attend another matter in the jail and my supervisor (the harasser) took my coat (knowing full well it was mine), looked through it, found my calendar and notes and read them. I found this out bc a day later I went on vacation and he kept on bothering and commenting to another FM officer asking her if she is going to write in her book about him. Telling her your coworker has “lawsuit worthy” things written in hers numerous times while I was away. She told me when I returned and since I’ve returned to work he has been nasty to me, punishing me in different discreet and hard to explain (unless you know the job) ways. One of my other supervisors (a rank below the one I am referencing) is also no longer even speaking to me so I know he is aware and has chosen a side already. I also know I will continue to be punished in the ways they can for some time to come which is making work almost unbearable.
The kicker is I never had a plan to report the harassment (which was at times physical) unless it got to a point I felt I was in danger of being sexually assaulted to an extreme I felt couldn’t be ignored. Even then I would have likely handled it myself if I was able to. Yet, I did keep a record of it all for that reason and because in this profession unfortunately lines get drawn and usually everyone takes the side of the male. I honestly just needed to cover my ass. 
Now, I am feeling FORCED to report it bc of the punishment and attitudes I am receiving from him and others all for going through my personal belongings (stealing some of my notes) and reading them. 
I really don’t want to go through the huge ordeal that it will be if I do report it. I like my job. I’m good at it, well liked, and feel this will make my life there and in general more stressful than it already is. I also know in the past many of men and women in there have gotten away with things they never should of. I am afraid this will be just another one of those things and I’ll end be punished anyway. I don’t know what to do."

She says she doesn't want to have sex, because she actually likes me and this relationship means more than that. I just want to find the right girl for me, and I don't know if it is her.

I've told her everything I've typed before, but she hasn't changed much except she is more affectionate. I know it would be wrong of me to do this, but when I deny her affection then she is all over me. I'm not talking about being a rude to her or anything, but if I start focusing on myself more and not being so affectionate towards her then I think it would work.

1096,dnn7cc,KoalaKazoo,Should I tell my in-laws to attend more family outings with their terminal son (my husband)?,"About four years ago, my immediate family (husband, son, and myself) moved across the country (USA) to our current city. Then, a little over a year ago, my in-laws ""followed"" us and moved to a city about 30 minutes away from our home.

Since then, we've seen them roughly once a month. Personally, I don't mind not seeing them much, as they annoy me for various reasons. Don't get me wrong; they're good people who love us, but their priorities seem off to me. The biggest thing that upsets me is that we frequently invite them to join us for family outings, but they often decline citing ""errands"" or ""household chores."" I get that they currently both work full-time, have four cats, and now a dog, but you'd think they'd find a way to set aside at least a bit of time to join us for a trip to the zoo, a spring/fall festival, a walk in the woods... Their excuses were especially annoying when they first moved out here, since his dad wasn't working and they just had the four cats. You'd think that his dad could have easily run any necessary errands and/or done the weekly household chores during the week while my MIL was at work, but apparently they're too old school to share the household workload (honestly, their views on women also irk me to no end).

After awhile, my husband admitted it hurt to constantly be rejected when he invited them out, so we stopped reaching out to them as much.

Then our world turned upside down: in August my husband was diagnosed with cancer, which has quickly spread. He's now in stage IV and about to start undergoing a clinical trial. As a result, my husband has gone back to inviting his parents out when he's feeling well enough to do things. You'd think his diagnosis would encourage his parents to try making new memories with him and their grandson, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Since his diagnosis in late July, they've visited him twice in the hospital, come over to our house for lunch once, and he met his mom during her lunch break yesterday. In my mind, those visits are basically meaningless, as they're not creating new memories of the active, vibrant, and adventurous person my husband still is.

I'm just so pissed at them, I now have a hard time not showing my contempt when we actually DO see them. Should I take them aside or text them to tell them how much it hurts when they turn him down for family outings? Would it be wrong to remind them they likely don't have much time left to spend with him and that maybe the ""errands"" and ""household chores"" can wait?"
23503,9cn5i0,rattles-snakes,Teaching my mother to treat customer service as real people.,"For a little background, my mother and I are both diagnosed cluster b which can make social situations very tricky to navigate. I turn 20 in a month and she turned 40 earlier this year, so she's not of the generation that gets a green card on bigotry or bad manners.
At restaurants, shops, and the like she is perfectly polite but when ever she speaks to customer service or a worker over the phone she turns into a beast. I've never seen or heard her be so irrationally angry.
I used to try to tell her after the conversation ended that it wasn't the fault of whoever she was talking to, but by that point she is already bubbling over and doesn't take kindly to even gentle suggestions. 
I feel awful for the workers who handle her when she's like this and do my best to give them a sympathetic ""I'm sorry- its not you its her"" smile.
Is there anything I can do to change how she reacts, or is she stuck in her ways by 40?
Thanks

20526,avy52m,_Journey_Man,Help," 

Hey everyone, I'm hopin this is the right sub to post.

I guess I'll start with who I am and my history. I'm 18, male, and my name is Noah. I've dealt with various mental issues for years now that had started to die down. But they started acting up again. I was severely sexually and mentally abused for years, starting when I was around 8 or 9. When I got taken out of the school where the abuse had taken place, I was stuck in a rocking position on my couch for about six months straight. No talking, no movement, no signs of mental cognitivity (if that's the word) besides eating and light grunts. Anyways, after 6 months of this I finally started to break out of my trance as if my mind had started to rebuild itself. I got sent to a small middle school around year 7 to try and rebuild my social skills, to no avail. I was changing who I was, what I liked, who I liked, basically a complete personality change every week or so. It was exhausting. I started to have these thoughts. Full of death, agony, and torture. They invaded my every thought. Every time I saw someone I would think of the most gruesome ways I could end their life. Every time I would enter a new room, I would see new items and get flooded with ways of killing my peers with said item. Soon the thoughts grew into urges, then the urges started to take over. I would come literally inches away from stabbing some kid with a pair of scissors many times. I told my parents about these thoughts and they said it was ""hormones"" and that I needed to pray them away. I graduated from middle school and my issues only got worse. I became extremely impulsive sexually, drug usage, and violence wise. I started lying about everything about me, telling various grand tales about my past and what I could do. I would manipulate people so easy, fabricating drama between people just to watch shit burn. I'd build up someones trust in me, then let it all fucking crash. I disassociate most of everyday, to the point that I go catatonic. I pretty much lose complete control over my entire body, eyes included, but I'm completely awake and aware that its happening. It feels like im just a ball of energy stuck in a hollow cave. Eventually my ""personality's"" morphed into the voices in my head. I have three; my neutral state, which reassures me that I'm mentally fine. My depressive one which tells me everything wrong with me and makes me harp on them. And the one that says hes a demon and fills my head with the violence. They take over a lot, but mainly just fight in my head. Sometimes both the depression and anger side breakout and have full conversations. My roommate has walked in before to them both talking at each other through my mouth, obviously freaking him out. In the past 2 years though, shit has take a turn for the worst, I started wanting to actually kill. Not just a slight want, but a need. I used to be scared of these thoughts and fight them, saying that its not me. But maybe it is me, maybe im supposed to kill. I started cutting myself, burning myself, spending nights alone in my dark room meditating on the violent thoughts and talking to myself. I have murder dreams all the time now. My roommate woke up to me asleep in my bed with my eyes open repeating ""I could do it. I could kill him right now.""I also deal with sexual anhedonia and I have sadistic personality disorder, obviously making a killer cocktail.I'm highly considering institutionalizing myself again.

TLDR; I'm a manic depressive, sadistic mess who will most likely go on a killing spree."

16843,bg00gq,ParkingBoysenberry,How To Break Up With A Friend?,"A bit of back story, 

A friend and I have been friends since school. Everything was going great until I get a call from a guy I was seeing and I left the room to get more popcorn and talk to him. There was obvious tension and I asked her what was up. She then went on a whole ramble about how I'm a bad friend due to the fact whenever we have a conversation, I look ""away"" and she believes that I am not interested in hearing what she has to say. (that was her only evidence of me apparently not caring). I reassured her that this far from the truth and I love hanging and speaking to her. After calming down, she began talking about her family and how certain people don't act in the way she wants them to act. eg. Her Dad doesn't open up to her or speak to her how she wants, her Mom doesn't understand her mental health issues. I tried to be there for her and tell her some strategies that have helped me whenever I felt alienated and it triggered her again. She went on a big ramble where I had to reassure her that everything was okay. The next day, I took some time to reflect and I kind of saw how drained I truly felt and I had never felt so unsure about a friendship. A few days past and we were chatting about things and I said ""you know I'm your friend, I love you!"" to which she replied ""look, you don't need to say that, I know you're my friend, why do you even say that?"" At this point, I was once again feeling super criticised for being there for her and trying to offer my advice. I obviously feel like the friendship is past, it was toxic, not making me feel good and I kind of saw a pattern of her controlling everyone around her - if she didn't like what you said or did because it wasn't her way; BOOM.   


Over the past few months, she has been messaging me to hang out - I've just been swamped by work and ignoring each message. It's not really healthy for me to hang out with her and I kind of wish she'd get the hint. My question is, do I just keep ignoring her, saying I'm super swamped with my job and other commitments or do I need to have a conversation?  Am I a bad friend for wanting this to end? Thanks!"

She's in the best and longest relationship she ever had, and I don't want to jeopardize that. She's my best friend, and I don't want to hurt her. Now to the context.

I've been friends with this girl for about five years now. She's celebrating her 18th birthday this week, and I invited her for ice cream to celebrate, but there's more to it. Like I said before, she's been in the best relationship she ever had, but her parents don't like the guy, because he's Mexican, and they're racists. They've taken away her phone's SIM card and her home internet access. She can only talk to him before school starts, and it's putting a damper on her demeanor.

I've liked her for a long time, and she even asked me out after we knew each other for a year, but I'm Christian, and my parents disproved. I wanted to say 'yes.' For the next four years, she's been in countless failed relationships, where the guy stopped talking to her, formally broke up (only a few did this), or sexually assaulted her. Every time she told me about this, I wanted to try after she cooled down from the event. I can't though. My parents have already said 'no' since five years ago. It kills me that she was settling with people that abuse her, and I just want to give it a shot.

I'm 18, she'll be this week. I think 'screw it, I'll try when I get the chance,' but she's been taken for 7 months now, and I doubt it'll end. I don't want to stop her (he treated her better than any guy she's been with, and she was in the best state she's ever been in because of him), nor do I want to ruin our relationship.

***Background***

I'm a 20yr old CS undergrad in Chicago (I've lived here my whole life) who's always held part-time jobs whilst being in school, first job I got was in High School at a neighborhood McDonald's and now I'm a ""part-time"" pizza chef around the wrigglyville area and have been every since I started college. I found my current job off of craigslist one night and applied as a cashier, and basically in the first week I was taught how to cook and make pizza and basically became one of the main chefs of this decently popular pizza joint. I've dealt with the Cubs crowd and the concert crowd for the past 2 years be it with coworkers to help or me one manning the crowd like the pizza Rambo I've become. My intention isn't to whine like a baby about how much work I do but it is important to understand that I've consistently worked any where from slow 20hr work weeks to over 45 hr work weeks (yes more than part time) all whilst being a full time student both in the normal fall and spring semesters but also in the summer semesters since I do take summer classes every summer, I'm used to working a lot so I was willing to put up with my intense hours and school workload up until now.

***Actual Stuff***

So now the actual issues, I know some of the stuff I've been doing isn't necessarily (legal) but this is Chicago, and you'd be a fool to be surprised that stuff like this happens, such as a negligent business owner letting a certified 18yr old (at the time) basically run his business alone whilst preparing food without any certifications. (I've attempted to get my boss to pay for my certifications for the past 2 years but yea that ain't happening in this timeline) The main issue lies with the way this business is structured, there is me the Rambo college student who is more than capable of running the restaurant alone who also has bragging rights that I've never received a bad review regarding my work, there is the owner (we'll call him John) who doesn't do anything for his business like a business owner should, has plenty of reviews calling him out, complete scumbag who doesn't care about anything but himself (If it isn't obvious I don't like him, there is more to John than just bad work ethic but as that is personal information and pretty big stuff I will not mention it) and he relies on other people to keep his business afloat. Then there is the Jacob family (that's what we will call them lol) they are the family that does everything the business needs to keep afloat whilst getting extremely underpaid. To clear up some stuff, we are basically a Hispanic establishment, and the head of the Jacob family who does all of the businesses work is also Hispanic, although he lacks his citizenship but is almost done with all the legal steps needed to obtain it. John doesn't care about his business, John is running a business which is in a extremely busy busy part of the city with its only employees being Me and the main Jacob and occasionally his daughters. We do everything whilst the owner who is in an extreme amount of debt (I've heard that the business is in big debt from the former financial adviser of the store) relaxes and goes on constant vacations leaving me and the main Jacob to do everything, from making all the balls of dough, marinara, supply orders, financial documents, production work (all the cooking needed to top our pizzas and other stuff) and etc. Me being the ""part-time"" employee I've done all of this without question because I got used to it and I essentially got to be my own manager and also my main priorities being in school, whilst on the other hand the Jacob family is doing this as a living, they are amazing people who have a work ethic I can only wish to obtain (I won't replicate it at work since I'm not getting paid enough to do so nor am I treated well enough to do so) but they do so regardless of all the shit they have to deal with from John. This brings me to now, to no surprise this is the second week that John has been on vacation in a row, I just started my fall semester as well, and we have nobody who can run the store alone besides me and the main Jacob, I obviously cant run the store everyday since the school semester started last week so that means that the main Jacob has to run the store for 12hrs+ when I'm not there since we are severely understaffed (I don't know why we haven't hired anyone) and not only does he run the store he does all the production necessary to keep the store running as well. John has basically been living off of the Jacobs family's honest work for many years way before I've been working at the store, but the state of the store has never been as bad as it is now. If I were to get sick and have to call off, John can't work since he is constantly out of town and even if he were in town he would try to find some way to weasel out of it , and the only person that can run the store alone is Jacob who already does all the other work when I'm not there. This means that if I were to quit, obviously employees are dispensable, but there wouldn't be an immediate person to run the business besides John and Jacob, and I know dam sure that Jacob will be doing all the work, because he is a honestly hard working guy that wants to provide for his family and doesn't want to jeopardize his position and income regardless of how much work he has to do which is insanely respectable. 

***The Now***

I'm sorry if I repeated myself a lot I feel like I did but I'm in the mood to just get this issue heard, regardless if it's done pretty or not. Why I have come to Reddit is because I've personally hit the limit of amount of work I can do for this business and I would rather pursue my personal goals and also focus on school since it is my 3rd year and I'm a struggling student, essentially just a pretty way to say I'm quitting soon. I know the second I propose the idea of quitting my boss will try to find some way to keep me here since I do a crazy amount of work for this establishment and that if i were to quit he'd actually have to start investing time into his business, this also means that Jacob would have to slave even more at work than he already does which honestly I don't see how he can do more than he is already doing but he will find a way. I don't feel any satisfaction quitting without even attempting to change how this failing business runs or without even trying to help the Jacob family, because I know that every single past coworker I've had feels the exact same way as I do. If you have any questions or anything you would want me to clarify I am more than willing to do so. If you read up until this point, thank you so much for your time I appreciate dearly. And again, I'm so sorry for how badly this post is structured."

I have applied to about 20 jobs so far, and 3 interviews including this one and this interview went the best and they seemed super excited to talk to me. I really hate where I live and I want to move to a different place and start fresh. I'd love to move to a warmer climate (currently in the North East). However, the pay starting out is pretty good $45K and it's the exact kind of job I'm looking for. I hate being around my parents and living at home, I just need to get out of here. At the same time, I could stick around for a year or two and completely eliminate my student loans, make some good money and gain some great experience. What would you do if you were in my position?"
14684,bqrnil,mayaic,Uni burnout? Depression? Jaded?,"I’m (F21) a junior in an Ivy League American university studying mathematical sciences and environmental science. I spent a year studying abroad in England and Australia and will be back in America starting in the fall. 
I don’t know what’s wrong with me right now, but the weight of not being a great uni student is hitting me like a truck. I was great in high school, great in my first semester of uni, and then just shot straight down and I feel like a total failure. Every semester, I get Cs in my math classes because I can’t understand theory. Last year, I straight up failed a class and it might happened again this Thursday on my last exam. It’s not for lack of trying, I’ve been studying every day for weeks, I just feel incompetent. 
Maybe math wasn’t what I was meant for, but I wasn’t meant for anything. I did genuinely like and was interested in math and was damn good at it until after calculus, but now I just dread it because it makes me feel so terrible. My family just wants me to finish and get my degree, but what’s the point in the degree if I basically just failed my way through it? I’ve been preparing my grad school applications because the field I want to get into requires it essentially, but why would anyone accept me when I’ve performed so badly? 
I don’t know what’s wrong with me right now. Usually when I do badly I just breathe relief that I passed and the semester is over, but the past few days have been such a weight and I feel so stupid and useless. I feel like all my work has been for nothing if I still fail my exams. I’m not sleeping because all I can think about is failing. My family and my boyfriend all say they’re proud of me and that I can do it, but I feel like even if I do it I didn’t do it well enough for it to matter. I’m so tired, physically and mentally, and I just don’t want to do it anymore. But I can’t stop because three years of my life and tens of thousands of dollars have been invested. I don’t want to feel stupid and worthless anymore. I’ve tried therapy which I personally didn’t find helpful. 
I was the one who was supposed to make it. My family isn’t traditionally successful education wise and while I’m not a first generation student, the only one who’s really gone to school is my mother. Even if I graduate, I still feel like a disappointment. I just always feel like a disappointment. 
Should I keep trying to go to grad school? Should I drop out? I don’t even know what to ask, I’m so lost."
28434,8mfic5,throwaway06071115,"Just got 3 really creepy voicemails today, not sure what to do.","Today I received 3 voicemail messages at 2:16 PM EST, 4:19 PM, and 10:07 PM. The messages are all exactly 3:00 long \(I assume that's the time limit on the messages\) and aren't super clear but they're all from a man who seems to be schizophrenic and looking for a female named Ally \(like short for Allison\). The *entire* first message is him saying a lot of sexual stuff like ""do you like to fuck black guys"" or ""I wanna fuck your pussy"" whilst probably masturbating. The second 2 messages sound like he's very confused, like he doesn't know there's no one on the other end of the line and he's trying to talk to Ally. Repeatedly asking her if she's married and waiting for long pauses as if giving her to answer. Googling the phone number brings up a page from a real estate website \([rehold.com](https://rehold.com)\) that shows a house in West Chester, PA \(I don't live in PA\) with a residence history of 4 people, 2 male and 2 female, with one of the males having the phone number that I received the voicemail from.

My friends all just tell me to block the number and move on but I listened to all the messages carefully \(ew\) to make sure there weren't obvious signs of stalking and to see if he reveals any information about himself or Ally. I didn't notice any obvious signs that this man was a danger to himself or others. It's likely that he lives with and is also financially dependent on family and that Ally may only exist in his head or is a stranger that just gave him a made up number that just happens to be mine. I just want to make sure I don't overlook a situation where there were was a ""right"" thing to do but I just missed it because nobody wants to deal with this crap. I've suffered from depression for years and have known people with schizophrenia so I know how we're still not out of the dark ages of mental health treatment. I just didn't want to reflexively treat this guy the way our culture used to treat people with mental illness, like just another problem nobody wants to deal with instead of a human being who needs helps and still deserves compassion. Also, if someone like this guy were stalking me or my hypothetical future daughter, I'd really appreciated if someone informed me of this. What, if anything, should I do now?

Tl;dr got creepy sexual voicemail messages from guy who is probably schizophrenic, and obviously doesn't have it under control at all, looking for someone named ""Ally"" but there are no obvious signs of immediate danger or any other useful info in the messages"

I never went to college so I started at the bottom and all Ive ever done is gain seniority there. Any raises Ive gotten were to just 'raise the floor' since their goal is $15 minimum wage. Its a great company. Its like my second family. They embrace everyone's uniqueness and are always willing to be flexible (with hours and such). I put up with an hour long commute each way just to go to this job. 



Recently a handful of people in the same department suddenly quit for different reasons. I am the most seasoned employee in this area, so naturally theyd like me to take over as lead. All Ive ever wanted was to be trusted in responsible roll (and also a fatty raise would be nice). 


The only problem is my mom was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Before the diagnosis, I was already only part-time at my work because aside from work, I help her at home, and take care of my son. My son and I live with her, and I think were all happy to have someone to live with, otherwise we'd all be alone. The reason I/we are anchored here, an hour away from my work, is because my mom runs her own business out of the home and has been for nearly 4 decades. 


Well, now that she is sick, someone has to drive her to doctor appointments and chemo sessions. I didnt outright turn down my manager's offer, but I did tell them my mom has medical issues I need to be around for. I havent told my mom about any of this yet. Usually she would be all for me making more money and whatnot, but Im not sure what shed think of it now that shes sick. My dad is pretty useless and is pretty absent. My brothers want to help, but one lives on the other side of the state, and the one who lives a couple miles away has his own demanding job and life. I just dont know if/how much slack they could pick up.


Do I turn down the work offer? Do I tell my mom and hope she gives me her blessing? (which means there will be a lot of upheaval regarding schedules, care of my son, etc)."

39389,7jsmkw,OvernightSiren,My mom will ruin my vacation. My husband will ruin my Christmas spirit.,"Posted something related to this situation the other day before shit hit the fan, but no one responded and...well...shit hit the fan. Now I don't know how to salvage my holiday. I'll try and keep this as tl;dr as possible.

Husband and I live with my mom and her abusive boyfriend. We've been planning a Disney trip with a cousin on my dad's side for months. My mom basically forced herself onto the trip. She's not staying with us, but at a nearby resort. I was trying to think of how to tell her that we don't want her to come, because we really just want a break from the norm. A break from her drama. 

Also it's hard for me to feel like I can act myself around my mom. I always feel like I have to act a little more reserved. And also I 100% never feel comfortable drinking around her. Growing up she was an alcoholic and always took an odd pride in the fact that I didn't drink until I was 21. Unfortunately that pride has carried into my adulthood and now any time I have a drink in my hand she gets whiny about it. I'm nowhere near an alcoholic (I drink like oncec a month, if that) but I was hoping to let loose this week after a really rough year.

The cousin I'm going with is 9 years older than me and has very fond memories of my mom from his childhood, since she was a very young mom (had me at 18). So he's just as close to her age as he is to mine and when he hit adulthood she was still young so they'd go out together sometimes. She's also bringing my 17 year old sister. These two factors combined make me feel like I'll be third-wheel'd to an extent. Like I'll feel that I'm sitting at the kiddy table with my sister while my mom, my cousin and his friends are living it up.

My husband's 30th birthday is also tomorrow. I've spent so much time saving for Disney and getting our tickets, that I'd thought that we'd had an understanding that his birthday wouldn't be anything extravagant. He's from Australia, so he doesn't have any family near here anyway. But the other day he started getting sort of mopey that we're not doing anything for his birthday. So I tried to pull shit together last minute. Tonight got us a free stay at a hotel that's part of the chain of hotels I work for--usually rooms there are $300 a night this time of year and $800 a night in the summer. We're also going out to dinner.  Then tomorrow on his birthday, I'm surprising him by taking him and some friends out to dinner in AC and then to see Star Wars in IMAX. But...none of that is good enough. He started **guessing** what I'm getting him for his birthday, and I told him I would just say ""no"" to all of his guesses, but somehow he genuinely thinks I'm taking him a few states away for a weekend getaway now, so I know he'll be disappointed with what I've gotten together. To make it worse, when I told him about our hotel stay tonight he sarcastically said to our friends ""woohoo, free hotel stay"" which made me feel embarrassed. Keep in mind that **MY** last birthday, I was so broke that I had to spend my **LAST 20 DOLLARS** buying him cigarettes and as a result had to go to /r/randomactsofpizza and beg for money to be able to eat. I can't blame my husband for being broke--he can't legally work (we're working on his citizenship now) but he doesn't realize how much I do for him. Every time we eat, I'm paying double. Every time we do anything, I'm paying double. And he smokes and is hardcore addicted to coffee.

So for weeks he's basically been pressuring me to level with my mom that we don't want her to come on the trip. But how could I have done that? It's her perogative to come to Disney. And I know she wants to come because I'm there and I don't want to hurt her feelings. Also, with us gone she'd really have no one to celebrate Christmas with except her asshole boyfriend. My strategy was just not to bring it up to her at all and hope that (like most things) she'd forget and drop the ball, but sure enough yesterday she excitedly told us that she got her tickets and already hit up her friends down there to get us dinner reservations at a few restaurants, so she's now basically controlling most aspects of the trip.

I knew **I'd** have an issue with her going, but  my husband went off the handles (on me) about it. Now he's saying he's not going. I've already bought our tickets, but he's adamant that he's staying behind. Part of me wants to say ""fuck it, stay here"" but then I know that on the trip I'll be hounded the whole time from people like ""Why isn't he here? What's his deal?"" etc etc. but since it's his birthday I don't want to just be like ""stop being a baby"". I'd usually be sure that he'd end up coming anyway, but the stress of him going on and on about how miserable he is that she's going has me genuinely not wanting to go either. 


Before my mom going was a massive inconvenience but not enough to the point that I didn't want to go. But now her going combined with his not wanting to go makes me feel like going will just result in him bitching the whole time and complaining about the trip afterwards so that we can't even look back on it fondly, and that in the end I'll be left feeling like I spent all this time saving and all this money on this trip for nothing because no one will enjoy it. 


Basically my Christmas is already ruined and I guess I'm just looking for any advice on how to salvage it. "
3344,dc7ouc,pineappleporkchop,Someone is stealing from me at work,"Basically on Monday someone in work stole £25 out of my purse and yesterday stole £20. The problem is where I work the business is a family business my boss, the manager and another admin assistant are all close family members. The only other employees are myself and another worker, we are not related to the family in anyway. There are other members of their family that call in and out of the office as well, although they don't work here.
So if I say to my boss that someone stole money from my purse twice this week, then it'll seem like I'm accusing her family. 

Should I bring this up to my boss? What should I say?"

I'm 13. My sister is 17. Her girlfriend was kicked out of her house for being a massive dick and doing drugs, so my parents thought it would be a good idea to let her live with us. They said it would only be for about a month, but so far she's been here for half a year. My sister (let's call her Hannah) has always been a pathological liar. Everything she says is a lie. She's got no empathy for anyone,  she blames everything on other people, shes extremely two faced, she does anything to make everyone else feel like shit, she's so toxic, she's hypocritical, shes manipulative and she can't do anything for herself. For as long as I can remember, Hannah has been emotionally and physically abusive towards me. I know that siblings fight, but atleast the majority of them know when they've got too far. It got to the point where when I was 11, I attempted suicide. Last year, my mom noticed something was wrong and began bringing me to therapy. It does help, but only temporarily. My house is really small, with 3 rooms, 6 people and 5 dogs. I share my room with Hannah and her girlfriend, who thinks it's a really good idea to smoke and drink in the tiny room, with the window and vent closed.

14304,bsl4f8,Komfortable,How do I negotiate this new job?,"Yesterday the owner of the company I work for called me and asked me to meet with him today. This morning he offered to create a new management position specifically for me. I’m a truck driver now, and this position would put me in a position to manage all the other drivers in my company. There are really only 4 others, but they need frequent support, and seeing as we contract for an extremely large company, there needs to be an intermediary.

The position is so new that they don’t really even have a structure planned, and the responsibilities are fairly poorly defined. It will be mostly my responsibility to define my own role. The owner said that as long as all of the work is getting done and all the paperwork is complete, accurate, and on time he doesn’t really care how I do things. He’s unconcerned with how much time I spend driving (I’ll need to drive a little, bit how much is yet to be determined; I’ll work that out with the other drivers), how often I’m in the office, or how many hours I work, so long as everything is running smoothly.

Here’s the stuff I know I’m responsible for:

Scheduling
Recruiting
Driver retention
Scheduling truck maintenance
Spec’ing new equipment

Here’s the compensation I’m aware of so far:

Base salary + bonuses
Phone allowance
Laptop
Company car

How do I negotiate this, seeing as the role is so poorly defined for now? Do I negotiate salary? Title? Benefits/perks? I have no idea what I’m doing here, and I want to make sure that I’m compensated fairly, but also I want to be affordable for the company and not ask for anything unreasonable for a small operation."
28432,8mfpuy,LoriTheGirl,Should I call CPS?,"I live next door to a three person family, a mother, father, and kid. The kid has several health issues including autism so it’s hard for me to guess his age, but I’d guess he’s around 12 years old.

I’ve been aware for a while now that my neighbors are neglectful dog owners. They own over 5 chihuahuas that they literally never take outside their backyard ever. I’ve dogsat for them and when I look into their house from the glass backyard door, I can see that the inside of the house is extremely messy. On a scale from 1 (just a little dirty) to 10 (hoarders level) I’d say it’s about an 8. I don’t think they ever clean their house. Occasionally they open their garage and... god. There’s literally just piles of garbage, clothes, and random junk. I’m sure they can barely walk through it.

The event that triggered me to write this post happened a few minutes ago. I just got home from giving my friend a ride somewhere and decided to sit in my car in the dark, scrolling through Reddit for a while. The front door to their house opened and the kid came out.

The dad came out shortly after him and yelled at his kid for “leaving his fucking ____ out”, and the kid went back inside to put whatever it was away without saying anything. The dad yelled and sweared at him some more, then went around the corner of the house. He took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes, like maybe he was crying? Then they both got in a car and left.

Normally I’d brush this off as a bad day for the father or something like that, but this isn’t the first time I’ve seen the parents swear and yell at the kid for just doing... kid stuff. The other time I saw it was through the window as the whole family was coming home from somewhere.

Reddit, what should I do? I don’t have a lot to go on, and I don’t know if what I’m seeing qualifies as the sort of abuse CPS would be concerned about."

Since that conversation, my second “promotion” date has been pushed back 6 months, then 4 more, for a total of 10. I have been making 13.50 since January. My boss/“director” of the program, keeps pushing these back as they come up, feeding me all kinds of promises that she never follows through on...

She is a good person, but she is super disorganized (keeps the company schedule “in her head” which has caused a lot of schedule fuck-ups that she then blames on the staff members and creates a lot of unnecessary drama. Has a lot of certifications and 20+ years caregiver and facility experience but no degree, no long-term management experience until now as far as I can tell. 

She has trust issues and has repeatedly told me she “knows I will stab her in the back”. I have anxiety issues and that shit drives them through the roof. When they do spill over she acts like it’s 100% on me for feeling that way and that I need to “get over it” rather than understanding that she has any part in it. I try to explain it and she just manager-splains back to me about why I am feeling how I am feeling (has said things like “I don’t know who hurt you but I assume it was a mother figure” just totally inappropriate speculation.) She regularly will make meeting times for us to talk about this stuff then cancel last minute, or make me drive 30 miles out to her house instead of meeting in our office 5 miles from my house. 

It’s basically just her and I in “management” positions although since being promised more responsibilities and less client shifts (I don’t mind clients, I love helping people, but I have a bachelors of science in business and I just feel like Caregiving as a career job is way underutilizing my skill set and ambition and career goals), I have basically become her errand girl and am at her beck and call to take shifts when people call out (sometimes at 4am, sometimes at 10 pm, because I need the hours, my schedule is all over the place because she sets my hours and offers me the “extra duties” as she sees fit, so some weeks I work 20 hours sometimes 50...) 

I’ve gotten to the point that I know I need to quit, following a conversation last week where I basically called her out on why there has been no discussion about my promotion or raise when the second push-back date has came and went with radio silence... after I made an accidental comment to a social worker who asked about a case that we had closed and let my boss know (she insists that I text her about anything and everything I do related to the company when I do it) I let her know and she flipped out on me (all phone communication, she is impossible to get a hold of in person), yelled at me, told me I “had grossly overstepped and she needed to hang up and think about what to do”... 

I was pretty sure I was gonna get fired because she liked to “put people on the do not staff list” to basically force them out of the company if they mess up in her eyes. When we talked later I came out with all the stuff about how these promises I had been made and the only reason I stayed with the company were not being fulfilled, she basically insinuated that I was having a freak out and that she didn’t know where this was coming from, so I demanded a meeting (in the office) politely and professionally to go over my future with the company and talk about these apparent professional boundaries I had never been trained on. 

A little back story, my degree (from Cal Poly SLO, a good school) is in Wine and Vit and business. Prior to this job I worked in the wine industry for 8+ years in production and sales. I was making $18/hr with benefits when I left my old job, but my soul was being crushed every day. I had also sustained a back injury while working harvest that was getting progressively worse and messing with my ability to walk and I just needed a break to heal mentally and physically. I thought working in an industry where I was making a difference and helping people would help, and it did for a while, but it’s to the point where I am living paycheck to paycheck just to make other people’s lives easier. My boyfriend of 5 years and I are about to do long distance for 6 months so he can further his career opportunities, so I need to be able to pay part of his portion of the rent and just be in a good headspace while my life gets a little bit more challenging. 

Also, I am just baffled that I have been working for $13.50 with no benefits for almost a year. 

The reason I’m even still here is because it’s literally just her and I at “management” level. There is a doctor who owns the company but I have only met him once in passing the whole time I have been at the company. His wife who does I’m not sure what probably something legit but also just lording over my boss (Director) and making life difficult, sucking at communication then coming in hot with unreasonable demands... she also has a brother who does something (no idea what although again he will pop up randomly and make a bunch of demands that throw everything off course, also the one time I met him he demanded I text him everything I am doing for the rest of the day if it is company related. Never had to do this before and have never had to do it again since that one day????) ... as far a I can tell it is a clusterfuck of mismanagement at the top, but I wouldn’t know forsure because I am actively kept out of any meetings, emails, etc. and any contact with the doctor, his wife, or her brother. 

We have no HR person. We outsource our billing. There is literally nobody else in this company I can turn to for advice or info... or if I did I know my boss would see it as me “stabbing her in the back” (one of her fears she has accused me of potentially doing in the future multiple times). 

I am just so done with this place. I can not believe I have been led with a non-existent carrot for so long and believed it. I’m actively looking for a new job. 

BUT I am super freaked out about the exit process. I really do not feel comfortable trying to quit without a mediator. We do not have one. Any attempt to use any other employee of the company would be taken poorly I know. 

So, what do I do? I’m gonna do this right, make sure I have a new job set in stone and signed contract or whatever before I put in my two weeks but how do I keep this woman from going psycho on me? What other shit might I have to look out for? 

She has literally lied to me and then been grooming me and straight up abusing my loyalty to the company and real connections with my clients to keep me on this sinking ship.

When I asked about a raise and title change/promotion last week she gave me some bullshit about how I would be stuck at $15/hr (for an assistant director position..?!)... for reference, we charge $32 an hour for services. I am the highest paid caretaker. We have to buy our own uniforms, pay for our own gas, often spend money on clients and do not get reimbursed.... just like what the fuck. I’m not an idiot. I know all that profit just goes right into upper managements pockets. 

She then told me about all these new programs we are launching (I do all the marketing for this company, I bring in at least 50% of new clients, don’t make commission, drive an average of 200 miles a week to do intakes, work the initial shifts with clients and put together personalized care plans, drive all over the county to drop off fliers at places the company approves even if my ideas for where we should market would hit our demographics more... no direct-to-client marketing as per the company’s rules, has to be through doctors offices or community centers...) and told me to “give her a year” and that she would get me to where I wanted to be... but then we never even discussed numbers?? And she has said that she can’t give me a job description because then she can’t ask me to do anything outside of that and it will “limit my potential”, WHAT???

Since we had our “come to Jesus” meeting my boss’s attitude toward me has totally changed. I told her I need a 48 hour break (usually I am semi-on call during weekend, although I don’t get paid unless I take a shift) and will call her on Monday. I plan on blasting out my resume this weekend. 

I’m sorry I just had to get this out because this last week has honestly been one of the most bizarre of my life, going from staying with this mismanaged shithole of a company because I thought I was climbing some kind of ladder, only to find out that it’s covered in bullshit. And then be told that’s the way it is and that if I can’t accept that then there is something wrong with me. “You would laugh if you knew how much I made. We don’t do this for the money”.... FUCKING. WHAT. 

I need help, advice, someone to yell at me to get the fuck out and how to do it safely. Please."

I've wasted pretty much the entirety of my teenage years by doing nothing and spending time on the internet all day. This year I want to be different, I want to make up for the years I've wasted.

Here are the facts:
 I've never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl to be completely honest with you so I don't know at all what I'm doing, I wish I did that when I was younger just so I don't make a fool out of myself. 

My school's weird, there isn't many people, most of which are socially awkward or annoying so I don't have many friends to choose from. 

My school doesn't support sports which I'd love to do, but since i haven't had the incentive I'm not really good at them.

I'm just about to take my drivers test in a few days.

I used to be really awkward and dorky but I've gotten much more confident and talkative after sophomore year, I've even changed a lot since the end of junior year.

I don't have many hobbies, or even an idea of what I want to do with my life. I make youtube videos and that's been fun but other than that I haven't really tried anything.

I'm not that smart and have like a 2.8 GPA

In a casual conversation with my partner while watching netflix earlier today, we got talking about sleep walking and people who wake up in a weird places in their house. I instantly started to feel emotionally sick when this memory popped into my head. I had to leave the room because I couldn't say out loud what was bothering me. 

I won't go into much detail, but when I was 5 or 6 years old, I straight up remember waking in the middle of the night, in our absolutely terrifying unfinished basement, naked on an old couch. 

I always wore pajamas to bed that covered my whole body. I would always be in bed early, and always woke up in my bedroom. I've never once had anyone tell me I'm a sleep walker. My bedroom was upstairs at the end of the hall. It was the furthest away from the back door/stairs. 

My mother is addicted to meth and my dad is addicted to a few other things. They didn't separate until years later. 25 years old now, and I am freaking the fuck out about this. I remember being so scared and confused. I think someone put me down there. I don't know what to do. "
2092,dinlat,moonywhiskers,How do I get over this embarrassment?,"So... I basically cried in front of my manager at work last night. 

To preface this, I'd already had a really stressful day at university. I had loads of deadlines and I missed an important feedback session because I got lost and couldn't find the right room (which was also really embarrassing...). Then on my way to work my dad phoned me to tell me he'd had to call an ambulance for my mum that morning and she was in hospital. He told me not to worry and she was okay now, but I turned up to work freaking out.

Because of all this, I was really distracted and off my game at work. I decided to just tell my manager what had happened so he didn't think I was acting weird or being rubbish at my job. I didn't expect to get emotional at all - I hadn't had a chance to tell anyone about what had happened to my mum and I thought I'd also worry less if I got it off my chest - but halfway through my story I was suddenly about to burst into tears.

It was soooo awkward.... He seemed very confused/surprised that I was telling him this and suddenly getting really upset. I was equally as confused/surprised. He started asking me all these questions but I could feel my bottom lip wobbling and knew if I spoke I'd just start crying. There were also still customers around at this point. 

I think I recovered pretty quickly and did feel waaaay less stressed after I told him. He was also pretty nice about it and said I could take any phone-calls I needed and offered to make me tea. But I'm so embarrassed that it happened and keep having flashbacks of it. Does anybody have advice on how to move past this?

I had to miss out on school plays, extra curriculars, and just all sorts of other fun things my friends got to but I didn’t. Now I’ve graduated high school. I’m not allowed to get to a job because my dad has decided to be a trucker and can’t afford a babysitter. He is preventing me from working and earning my own money. 

He was paying me at first, but we got hit hard financially. Now I get about $100 every two or three weeks, but I have to ask for it. And even then, it’s been two weeks since I have gotten anything. I told him I would need money for my best friend’s birthday trip coming up soon. When he asked how much I needed, I said $100. He paused for a second, said “wow”, and said he will see what he can do.

38249,7nbm9c,useful1diot,I am kind of being stalked by a co-worker,"So this is just scratching the surface but I started working for a small company a little over a year ago. There is a guy who works there who I became friends with in the fact that we would take smoke breaks together and shoot the shit. I found him harmless and still kind of do. I first accepted his friend request on Facebook and he asked me for my phone number, which I gave him, thinking it was harmless again because we were friends. 

He started messaging me non-stop, and I mean non-stop. Over and over again. I stopped answering him and then he'd get mad and slam doors in the office and make a point of ""ignoring"" me, send me nasty messages. (Let me just say he was in court ordered anger management when I met him and he is very emotionally immature and paranoid). He went on my pictures and did the laugh reaction to pics of me and my bf. I finally blocked him on everything and he begged me for months to unblock him.

So I unblocked him on texting bc I just got so fed up w the environment he created for me at work. It was very uncomfortable and I figured I could just ignore his incessant texting. It still continues and then a few weeks ago I got in my car to go to lunch and there was two brownies on my seat with a note saying ""don't worry I didn't put any drugs in them"" with a wink face and a heart.

I was already fed up and this made me so angry so I went to him and calmly told him I felt like that was a violation of my personal space and to please not do that again. He got angry and didn't talk to me, did the tantrum thing I hate and just generally made me wish he would just never come into the office. 

So like 2 weeks later was xmas and I go to my car and there's a present and a card on the driver's seat. He wrote a note in the card that wasn't inappropriate but just fucking creepy and the whole thing made me angry. I didn't say anything this time.

Now, he has had multiple complaints about his behavior from other coworkers of mine and I know what I should do is talk to my boss but I'm apprehensive. I don't want to get him fired even though I hate working with him but more so I'm not sure if he will retaliate. I haven't told anyone at work but I have pictures and text messages to prove everything which I can screen shot if you guys need me to to tell me if I'm being too sensitive.

What do I do?"
39432,7jo2wt,daBEARS40,"Attending a friend’s brother’s funeral for the first time, have a few questions","Hey all, thanks in advance for the help.

My friend is a twin whom I’ve known since middle school. We’ve grown distant over the years since graduation(I’m 20 now) but I’ve seen him a couple times at parties and such, and it’s always fun. I didn’t know his twin as well as my friend, but I’ve met their family before and I know his sister fairly well, and I knew his twin throughout school and had run into him around town a few times before his death, so I’ve decided to go even if we’re not that close anymore.

The funeral is in the middle of a work day, and I will be able to duck out after lunch and stop by to pay my respects. I have a few questions about how I should go about this.


1. I can’t stay for the whole funeral. I can leave work for 30 minutes max, and the funeral is at 2PM. Should I visit right at 2, pay my respects, and leave before every one sits down? Should I show up at 3PM instead, do you think they’ll be up and walking around the room by then? I just want to get in, pay my respects to the family, and leave.


2. Is it appropriate to bring a bouquet of flowers or some sort of token of my condolences for the family, or should I just not bring anything?


3. Is this whole idea wildly disrespectful? My relationship with the family is distant at best, but less so with my old friend. Is it rude to stop by for 15-30 minutes and leave right after? What if the family is busy talking to other people the whole time I’m there?


Sorry for the wall of text. I want to pay my respects to my old friend and his family but my inexperience is making me nervous and I’m considering not going at all, which I feel I may regret later on."
28183,8o10iu,throwaway77861t,"Tough situation, what can I do about this?","Long story short, my ex boyfriend 18[M]  and I 17 [F] were at a mutual friends house party and ended up arguing. I was getting ready to take off from the party, sitting at my car in front of the house, talking with a friend before starting the engine and taking off. While I was there talking with said friend, another “friend” (We’ll call him JC)  approaches the two of us and asks me if he could borrow my iPhone and call his girlfriend (whom I still go to high school with)  cause his phone is dead and she was getting mad at him for being at the party. Sure yeah, why not. I unlock my phone and hand it to him while he walks off a bit to go and “talk to his girlfriend”. After finishing up the chat with my friend before finally being ready to leave, I ask my friend to go back into the party and retrieve my phone from JC. At this point maybe (max) 10 minutes have passed since I lent out my phone and I was under the assumption he was talking to his girlfriend the entire time. Friend brings back my phone, I leave and go home. 

While I’m at home I ask another friend of mine and my ex-boyfriends (D) to keep an eye on my ex-boyfriend.. to not let him do anything stupid like try and leave the party or drink even more. 
As I’m chatting with D on Snapchat, he tells me that my ex-boyfriend just fought JC for going through my ex-boyfriends phone. As soon as I read that message I double pressed on my iPhone to check the apps that were last used and sure enough, my photo gallery was one that was recently used and one of my booty pics was right there as soon as I opened the app. I check the call log, he was on the phone with an unfamiliar number for only a minute long, I’m assuming it was his girlfriend. 

I freaked the fuck out, finally realizing that JC went through my phone too, but as I panic, my ex-boyfriend calls and tells me that from his iPhone which he also lent JC, sent MY booty pics, tit pics and lingerie pics from his phone to JC’s phone. JC had ex’s phone for maximum 5 minutes. Ex caught him in the act and rocked his shit, leaving him bloody and bruised. Other friends there at the party took JC’s to phone and apparently deleted everything from his google pixel. I’m not certain that he didn’t send my pictures from my phone to his, cause he could have deleted the message history from my phone before giving it back. But ex- boyfriend has the picture messages sent from his iPhone to JC’s google pixel. 

I went back to the party, to pick up ex-boyfriend and to potentially fuck this guy up myself but when I arrived the perverted coward had taken off. I spent all night crying and wondering if all the pictures actually weren’t deleted, or if they could be backed up somehow or if he had pictures from my phone and the ones from my ex were the only ones deleted. I have no idea what to do, Reddit. Can I take legal action against him? Will I get in trouble for 1.) Taking those pictures at age 16/17
 2.) sending those pictures to my ex 
3.) having those pictures on my phone ? 
Please don’t call me stupid, I already know this is my fault.. I just want to fix this. "

Let me give some background. Me and some friends are going to festival in a few months time. We booked our tickets and extras back in November. We avoided mentioning it to this friend as we didn't want him to attend. 

Why we didn't invited this guy. Hes the type of guy who as soon as he gets a girlfriend he disappears off the face of the earth. You could be best mates one day then the next hes gone, as soon as that relationship ends he comes and barges his way back into the group. Hes also very demanding/needy and if you tell him ""No"" then he will winge and moan until he gets his way.

The event was sold out but now some tickets for the event have become available and now he wants to come.  

The majority in the group don't want him to attend but we don't know how to say this without completely destroying the guy. 

Any advice??

Thanks"

I already had a meeting with HR earlier in the month where I had to address a supervisor that talked down to me due to my age. Since then, I've been asserting myself to the supervisors because I understand they see me as a child and don't take me seriously. They cut me off in conversations, don't give me credit for ideas that are implemented on the floor, and don't answer my questions. 

One of my managers is trying to write me up for having attitude, but its coming from no where. He said its the way I ask questions and how I can come off, but he's one of the managers that treated me differently about my age before I went to HR.

We have 4 trainers on the floor and I've interacted with several of the other managers/upper management as well. They never said anything about attitude, treated me differently, or give any social cues about my behavior. We even tell jokes to each other and chat freely on breaks. My coworkers said I was laid back and quiet. 

Please give me advice. He is an operational manager and the other is a supervisor, they are trying to fire me. Its 3am and I'm crying because I need this job but i'm already afraid to go back to work.

30424,8dhkpm,TimTheOriginal,What institution do I go to to get myself tested for Asperger's?,"When I was 6, I got tested for autism. The diagnosis: I was a regular kid. When I was 8, my mother felt the need to get me tested again. This time I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Now I'm 18 years old, and I'm in college, with a couple of senior psychology students as my friends, who seriously doubt my diagnose. I know that a student isn't really qualified to diagnose someone, but I have always had some doubts about it myself, since all the other kids at the group my mom sent me to because she was so convinced of how special I was were actually autistic, and I felt like the only normal person there. I haven't used any of the facilities the university offers to people on the spectrum, and I don't really plan on using them since I don't want to have an unfair advantage of getting an extra hour to take my exams while that might not even be for me.

So basically, I want to get myself tested again to clear out my doubts, and simply out of curiosity. When I look up how and where to get myself tested though, I need a reference from a psychologist or something, but I just want to take the test without going through so much trouble. Do I see a psychologist just for a reference and get myself tested? If so, what institution should I typically go to? The university offers relatively cheap psychological help, but I'm not sure whether this is a good reason to go there.

TL;DR: I had two different diagnoses as a kid and I want to know whether I'm autistic or not. Who do I see? "
8359,clq97o,283839198,"I told my teacher I had a crush on him, where should we go from here?","So before summer break me and my teacher got really close, and I spent a lot of time with him after school, eventually developing a crush on him. I told him about it, and didn’t get much of a reaction, and school ended uneventfully. 
We got back into school this last week, and I’ve been ignoring him, obviously out of embarrassment. When I’d see him in the hall I’d pretend he wasn’t there and refuse to meet his eyes. On Friday I got sick of it, and decided to confront him about it after school.
 I walked into his room and we sat down and talked. I thanked him for not reporting me to the school, and he said he just did what was best for the both of us. When I asked what he felt when I told him about my feelings he said he felt fear. Fear he’d lose his job, fear that I could be damaged by this, fear that we would get back to school and I would completely ignore him. That was a big thing for him, that I’d been pretending he didn’t exist, and I was apologetic for having done that all week. He said he’d wanted to say hi but wanted to respect me if I needed space. 
He basically gave me two options; we can forget I said what I said, and remain close friends or we can continue to pretend we don’t know each other and let that be the end of it. He basically put the decision in my hands and said that he would follow my lead, so how I treat him on Monday is going to decide what our relationship is from now on. He expressed his care for me, and his want to be in my life, but assured me that he would never use my confession against me and that though it hurts him to pretend like we’ve never met, he’s willing to do so if that’s what I need. 
I’m caught here, wondering if I should just take the win of not being reported and cut my losses here or if it would be shitty to do that to him when he was merciful enough to spare me from being social ostracized. We see each other multiple times a day as his class is very close to others I’m taking, and there’s no way to get where I need to be without seeing him.
I’m still crushing on him, I’m not sure if he’s aware of that, but I don’t know if ignoring him would make that easier or harder to get over"

I need help.,"i've always been lost. i never knew for sure what was my drive or motivation in life and i don't know how to find it. i'm about to turn 20 next month and i still live with my mom, i got kicked out of college. i want to go back to school, but i don't even know what for except for social interactions. i never managed to keep a job more than three months, and i spent the last few weeks alone at home, playing video games with this friend of mine, going out sometimes to do some errands. people think i'm lazy and whiny, because i don't have a job, but the thing is, i'm highly unsatisfied with any job i'm allowed to have at my age. even if it's 10 hours a week, i feel like i'm wasting my time on something useless with useless people who like to empower themselves with their shitty job status. i want to dissociate myself with the concept of money which i despise so much, but there's no way around it, cause my mom won't keep me here forever. the only word i have for this situation is ""alienation"". i feel like a stranger to everyone and i keep getting this unease to just be in the world, this extreme discomfort with what life is. it's overwhelming to me. i feel like i've completely become separate from the world and its mentality when the only way into the world is if you try and fit within it. i tried that, but i hated it. now i just don't know what to do anymore. most jobs make me wanna die everyday for days on end and it's not because i'm lazy, it's because i genuinely don't like them. if i'm passionate about something i can spend hours on  doing that thing, but i can't make money out of any of them. is it wrong to think that money and jobs are a sort of prison and that we never truly are free in this world?

12632,c0j5i8,RoadsidePoppy,Is it me or does my job actually suck?,"I'm noticing a pattern with myself. I feel excited and challenged when I start a new job, because I'm learning new things and getting a chance to show what I know. After about 6 months, I start to feel incredibly bored and apathetic about the work, and feelings of incompetency start creeping in. I've changed industries and tried a small variety of roles to see what I like.  I've shadowed other teams, applied for positions, taken online training, and read recommended books, but I still feel stuck. I'm getting discouraged that I'll ever find a long term role where I feel motivated and excited to come to work every day.

Is this normal for everyone else?

2745,dfctw2,Drexxyl,My Suicidal Best friend uses suicide as a weapon.,"Hello all, I am a 24M and my best friend is a 24F. We have been best friends for 3 years now and counting. She has had a hard life up until this point and it has only gotten harder for her with the introduction of her being told she has stage 4 Cancer. She's struggled with suicidal thoughts for a while, but with the recent news it's gotten worse. Well lately, it's taken a new turn. Whenever we find ourselves disagreeing on something or she doesn't like something I've done (Spending an evening with another friend, wanting to take a new job where I would travel a lot), she has gotten into the habit of storming off, texting me that she's going to kill herself, and then sleeping somewhere else (I should mention we live together) leaving me frantically calling everyone I know and driving around for hours searching for her. She knows I respond like this, and whereas with some select people I've known in the past who may use ""I'll kill myself"" as an excuse for shitty behavior but with no follow through, I know my best friend will actually do it. I've had to stop somewhere in the couple dozen range of attempts happening directly in front of me. 

This behavior came to a head tonight where I tried to explain that I might potentially be questioning my sexual identity and she became furious that I had been keeping it a secret for a few weeks and that I was only just now letting her in on that part of me. She stormed off and the same thing happened. Now I'm just sitting in my car panicking and calling people trying to figure out how real this is and where she might be. 

My mental state has really been taking a dive with all of this happening. I'm constantly stressed, and I can't sleep many nights. On a good week this will only happen once, but sometimes is multiple times. Work is becoming incredibly difficult with all of the late night searches and I don't know what to do. My only goal is to keep her alive. I care about her more than anything, but with her refusing to get mental help or take medication or even talk to someone outside of me, I can't help but feel like my only option is to give up, which hurts a lot to think about.

Writing my thoughts down is helping me calm down, but this feels like it won't end until the worst has happened. I'm sure I'm missing some key details here and there, but still... Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? I'm at my wit's end. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I feel people are offended when I don't open up, but I honestly have nothing to say...that I don't share. I typically work things out internally or throw them out if I feel they have no use. When I explain this, I feel psychoanalyzed or judged. I've ""got walls up."" Once I do have a moment of frustration that I end up letting out or slip (because I really try not to involve others in my issues)...they get offended. Basically, I am judged for not being ""human"" enough, but once I have a human moment...I get dropped. I am honestly confused. My husband gets me, but he is the ONLY one. I just don't talk very much...and when I do, I tend to want to open mouth insert foot. Maybe this is why I don't talk very much. I thought I had a friend, and I voiced some frustration over a text (not about her, but a situation)...she continues to tell me to calm down and breathe deep (which I found a bit insulting) and then doesn't reply to me. I apologized for sounding rude, but reminded her I was frustrated with my current situation. I still haven't heard back. Is this normal? Why do people do this? I may have been deflecting in the moment, but after letting her deflect to me for about 6 months...I don't get a turn to be upset?

My parents marriage has never been great with lots of snide comments, passive aggressiveness and bickering between the two for the past 30+ years. I had a deeply disturbed older brother who died 2 years ago from a drug overdose after 20 years of constant arrests, accidents and stalking. 

I feel shadowed by my parents. My Mother calls or texts me daily. Every week there seems to be some holiday or family event that I am obligated to attend. 

The past few weeks, there has been a family dinner for Father's Day, my niece's birthday, July 4 and today is my brother's birthday dinner. I asked my brother if he would mind if I skipped because I have a 14 hour work day tomorrow and going to weekly family events is tough. It's about a 2 hour drive round trip with the traffic. 

He said he didn't mind and I'm sure he's telling the truth. 

My Dad is passively aggressively texting me saying: ""Can't you stop by for 5 minutes just to say Hello?"" He's a huge hypocrite because he's hardly ever home and he's always late to everything. For most family dinners he shows up 1 hour late. 

My Mother called me and said: ""How would you feel if your brother skipped your birthday???"" I said I wouldn't care one bit and my brother told me he didn't care, either. 

How can I avoid weekly family events? My Mother will be very upset if I don't go to them all. In the past she's said how lucky I am to have family and how I should go to everything.

So im young and in a relationship with a great girl we have been together for almost 2 years now, and just today i was looking around her phone cuz i noticed her getting all possessive of it or protective anyways.

I find the reddit app so i open it and im not one to snoop usually i think its inappropriate and an invasion of privacy but i just had a feeling and i find she is DMing guys about our relationship problems and flirting to the point of hookup sounding stuff, and i find her posts and there about being sexually frustrated and that she is thinking its because of her looks and how it damages her self esteem.

context we had a pretty steady sex life for our whole relationship, but in the pass month my exams have been coming and i have been kinda foggy minded so i haven't been keeping it up.

so i find all these DMs saying that she is unsatisfied and i read a bunch of stuff that i didnt know she thought about me like that im not very attractive and she likes me for my personality or that my sex drive isnt high enough all while saying how much she wants to fuck them and sexting shit ending up giving them her snap

And i understand that girls can feel that way or have drastic assumptions but she is going on about how im hurting her self esteem while she completely shattered mine idk......

and i have cought her once before sexting some guy on insta no pics but i dont really care and now im just not confident in how much i trust her faithfulness and if i wanna stay with her idk....

Sorry for the long post.

TL;DR; : Im just asking for advice on how to deal with my girlfriend being unfaithful and destroying my self esteem"
13906,bu1jj7,ecgoldsmith,AITA for wanting to help a shy boy from an annoying one?,"I take the bus to school and there’s a group of middle/high school aged kids that get on. A kid who looks to be about 14 years old is cringing and very obviously leaning away from a very obnoxious peer, who insists on talking loudly and invading his personal space by leaning in and “whispering” in his ear. He’s in obvious discomfort and looks absolutely miserable, and the annoying kid is just yapping away happy as can be. The other peers are very obviously avoiding eye contact with the situation, and who can blame them? It’s early morning, and no one wants a kid spitting loudly in their ear about god-knows-what.

I wanted to invite the “victim” to sit next to me and tell him it’s okay to stand up for himself. Not be mean, but gently relay the information that he is uncomfortable and would like some personal space. Tell him he has the right to not have it invaded and that he doesn’t need to start every morning as miserably as he does.

I don’t know the situation in its entirety, and I would agree with those of you who say it’s none of my business except it is to the extent that this kid’s total lack of awareness is irritating me, too.

By the time I worked up the courage to discreetly confront him, we’d arrived at his stop and they got off. I watched him go around to the rear exit of the bus, while the annoying boy got off the front. In an attempt to distance himself, he took the long way around but the peer chased him down and continued talking. I feel terrible for him.

I know it’s wrong to even think of blaming the annoying boy, since he has an obvious inability to socially gauge the situations around him. I know it’s something he can’t control, at least not without some help. But I can’t help but cringe every time he steps onto the bus, harassing his tortured peer. I don’t want to turn a blind eye to someone in need. And by need, I just mean a pep talk to give him confidence to assert himself in a positive and polite way.

Advice, please! (And please don’t assume I’m intolerant or have a phobia of people with intellectual limitations. Nothing could be further from the truth. I’ve worked happily with children and adults with different intellectual abilities, and never treated them with any less respect than any other human being.)

TL;DR How can I approach and convince a high school student to stand up for himself against an obnoxious boy who won’t leave him alone?

EDIT: To make this clear, in case it isn’t, I want to talk to the “victim” boy, not the annoying one."
33998,81arfs,name2018,How to cope with the stress and disappointment?,"I come from a family that had lots of debt but my parents worked insanely hard to provide for the family. Since I was a child I was seen as the beacon of hope, it was always I will get educated and bring the family out of the cheque to cheque living? Parents worked overtime, double shifts to make sure I always had everything I could need. I did really good throughout the younger years and decently in undergrad as well. All the siblings/cousins were told to look up to me and follow my footsteps. Never really enjoyed life, always felt guilt if I hung out with friends because I knew the efforts everyone was putting in for my education. Basically kept isolating myself from the rest of my life. Tried really hard in grad school, studied all day pretty much (I guess studied hard, not smartly or didnt study properly, idk) but it was not enough... failed. Now, I'm completely lost. Not only have I essentially wasted the years of my life I was suppose to remember in old age, but I have destroyed the people who were depending on me, looking up to me. Disappointing in my self, and having trouble how to face my parents, younger siblings, cousins with my failure status. Long story short, I was wondering if there is anyone else who has been through this or going through that can offer advice?"
18762,b5f2j8,kurotoes,My widowed father is an alcoholic and I’m worried about him and my little sisters,"I want to preface this with the fact that my father does not become violent towards us when he drinks. Also, that he is an amazing father, while sober, that does everything he can to provide for us. 

For some background: I’m 22, I live with my boyfriend and not with my family. My sisters are 13 and 15. They are still at home with our dad. Our dad is their biological father, but my step-father. He’s been in my life since I was 3 and I consider him more of a father to me than my biological one. When I was younger (6-12), my dad had a lot of alcohol issues. I don’t remember much other than him getting belligerent randomly, my parents fighting, and my mom taking us (kids) to a hotel. This would happen pretty frequently... or maybe it just feels like it now because those night were the most traumatic. Finally, when my mom threatened divorce and moved out of home, he stopped doing this and vowed to change his ways (2010ish). 

Another thing i need to add for context: his health. He has a form of red blood cell cancer and also some rare mutated gene. You wouldn’t know when looking at him, he acts healthy, but i think he’s just got a lot of willpower. The doctors have been saying his life expectancy is little to none for the past 11 years. When I was in 7th grade he almost died from clots in his leg, heart, left lung, and pneumonia all at one time. He’s been on blood thinners ever since which makes alcohol a problem because he gets beyond belligerent and FAST. 

My mom died of cancer two and a half years ago and things have been rough ever since. My dad has been severely depressed. He holds it together for us (mostly). But, holidays, anniversaries, and just randomly, he will get beyond belligerent. To the point where he is endangering himself. He will fall all over, hit his head on stuff and will be bleeding profusely (blood thinners). I don’t see it now as much because I don’t live there and he avoids doing it around me. My sisters will call me at 10pm crying saying “dad’s drunk” followed by a rundown of the chaos that’s been happening that night. I then help them figure out what to do. If they should go to a friend’s house, which friend, etc. (I live an hour away, but I’ve driven out to get them before). 

The older of the two sisters has been getting fed up. She will send me texts that break my heart (because they’re true) saying how they don’t deserve this and it isn’t fair (they’re more in depth than that, but that’s the gist). I can tell she is starting to have resentment for him. She acts cold towards him after he drinks (rightfully so). He acts like nothing happened, denial.

I am so worried. First, I worry that he is going to kill himself. I don’t know the specifics of his health condition, but my mom used to make him sound like he is fragile. “He could die if he hits his head too hard” I can hear her voice in my head. 

Second, I worry that my sisters will get taken away. One concerned parent’s phone call to cps and my sisters could be put in foster care. Then I will have to hope that I’m able to legally adopt them - I haven’t looked too much into my eligibility. 

I just don’t know what to do. It’s so hard with addiction especially when it seems like he thinks he doesn’t have a problem— like most addicts it seems. 

Another problem, he shuts people out who try to impose themselves into our family or interfere. We don’t have a lot of family: his family is in France &amp; our mom’s side are a bunch of looneys in the South (opposite side of the country). I’m not saying all people in the south are looneys, I’m saying THESE people in the south are looneys. You don’t even want to hear about them. Each one has some horrific personality flaw. We keep our distance. 

Basically, If I involve someone, he will take it as an attack on our family and shut them out. 

The most obvious answer is that ** I ** need to sit down and talk with him. But what do I say? How do you approach a grown adult, your mentor in life, and talk to them about something like this? Like they’re the child now. I’ll have to suck it up and just do it. I fear it won’t change anything though.

Also second, therapy. I don’t know if I can convince him to get into counseling (although he needs it most), but I know I need to get my sisters in. Are there resources to help with that? Money isn’t abundant. We live in California by the way. 

This doesn’t happen too often. Once a month or so, but when it does, it’s traumatic. My sisters go to a friends house, they shun my dad, and then everything slowly goes back to normal. Normal meaning him being a great sober father providing for his three daughters on his own and working his ass off 13+ hours a day to do so. Until another incident happens again... 

It breaks my heart to hear about my dad in so much pain. Putting us through so much pain. It also pains me to even publicize that he’s doing this - admitting that he’s screwing up. 

But, at the very least, it feels good to vent this out. Any and all advice is welcome. "
13372,bwpgqn,amaraemme,Should I go to law school if I got a free ride to a top-50 university but am leaning towards not practicing law?/What careers should I pursue?,"Background: I have vague career goals rn. All I know is that I want to work on impactful environmental policy in a role that’s very fast paced, varied, collaborative, and people-facing (these characteristics are nonnegotiable for me). Maybe government relations/public relations? But I’ve been struggling to figure out what roles match this description.

I took the LSAT under pressure from my parents, and I got a score sufficient to win an almost free ride from a top-50 law school. I wouldn’t even have to pay room and board because I’d be living with my family (which I don’t mind at all). I accepted the scholarship and deferred for a year to work at a legal services nonprofit, which has allowed me to network with large/small firm, in-house corporate, and pro bono lawyers to gauge if I can see myself in their roles. I’ve concluded that I could make it through law school and be a practicing public interest environmental lawyer, but I don’t light up thinking about it given the sheer amount of reading and paper pushing involved (my sense is that this is the majority of what lawyers do, and my past work experience shows that I am miserable sitting at a desk all day, even if I have a variety of tasks to accomplish). OTOH, a law degree could open doors and teach me skills that lead to a role that aligns with my goals.
Maybe a masters program (MPA, MPP, etc.) would be better... but I already have this free ride. So, should I go to law school? Is a law degree useful for pursuing my goals?"
12717,bzzw8k,SetMySoulFree,"The accountant at my job won't communicate when time sheets are due, causing me to miss turn in dates. What should I do?","TL;DR The accountant at my job does a very poor job of communicating when time sheets are due, to the point where I've missed 3 time sheet due dates in the past year. Would I be out of line to ask him to communicate to me via text, call/voicemail, or email when time sheets are due so I can get them turned in on time and get paid for the work I do?

So, at my job, because there less than 40 people on the pay roll, it doesn't make sense to have some sort of clock in/clock out system, so the hourly workers have to write down their hours on a time sheet and get them turned in every other week. We're supposed to get paid on the 1st and 15th of every month, and we're supposed to get out time sheets turned in to the accountant. No big deal. But, even though we're supposed to get paid on the 1st and 15th, the due dates for time sheets are very unpredictable. The time sheets for the June 1 pay date were due May 28, 4 days before we get paid. The time sheets for the June 15 pay date were due today, June 12, 3 days before the pay date. I understand that the accountant has to get the information into the computer and sent to the bank, and banks have to communicate, therefore the turn in date being a few days before the pay date.

Here's my issue. I'm a janitor. I'm all over the building. I can go a month without seeing the accountant. There are 5 of us on the maintenance/janitorial team, including my boss, who is the head maintenance guy. What normally happens is the other janitorial/maintenance people will keep their time sheets in a plastic thing on the wall in his office. It works out pretty well for them because 2 of them are his daughters, and one works with him most of the time. I, on the other hand, only have reason to go to that part of the building twice a week, in accordance with my duties in the building. The accountant will normally write on a whiteboard next to the time sheet bracket on the wall when time sheets are due. This is his only communicate he gives, with the exception of tracking him down and asking him, if he happens to know off the top of his head. Of course, I could make it a habit to go in my boss's office to check when time sheets are due. But, that's not always predictable. Sometimes, Accountant will write when time sheets are due 3 days before, sometimes the day before, sometimes he'll grab the time sheets without telling anybody. I don't keep my time sheets in the bracket, so when he does this, my time sheet isn't turned in. Normally, my co-worker will text me and let me know when she sees Accountant's note about when time sheets are due, but she can't do that If Accountant doesn't write the date on the whiteboard and just takes the timesheets.

I hate dealing with people I don't know and I know that I may need to get over it in this circumstance. Last time sheet (June 1 pay date), I had put all my hours for all of May and a few days from the end of April on the time sheet. If I don't get a time sheet turned in on time, I can just continue recording my hours for the next due date, so I don't lose hours/pay, I just get paid 2 weeks later than normal. Anyhow, with the June 1 time sheet with all my hours on it, I wrote a more saying *""Here's my phone number and email address, I check both regularly, would it be possible to text, call, or email me when time sheets are due so I can get them turned in on time?""* It was more politely worded than that, but it was just disregarded. I may need to talk to him in person about contacting me when time sheets are due."

19521,b0ztc8,RaveStatue,Should I abandon a career for Menail work?,"So I'm a 21 year old guy whose nearing the end of a 2 year long level 4 apprenticeship in Cyber Security. 

The employment that's waiting at the end is excellent money (close to 30K a year), excellent pension, good working hours, 5 days a week, job for life (some people have been here 40+ years)

I'm sure lots of people would kill for this kind of opportunity.

The probelm is that i cannot bear the thought of having to work here permanently!

In short, I have absolutally no passion for this job anymore. The work is boring, the people are boring, the company is boring and it's making me perpetually miserable having to work here.

I was largely pushed into it by my family who have always been very pushy for me to get a ""career"" job.

I get that lots of people hate their jobs, i know it's not exactly uncommon but i feel like If i take this seemingly amazing job offer in a few months I'm going to waste my 20s being myserable with no ambition or drive to do well at work.

I'm worried about what kind of a person thats going to turn me into 10 years down the line. 

Lately I've been thinking of either quitting or turning down the employment offer and instead just taking up menial work for a while. Things like bars or shops. 

Not exactly glamourous or well paid I know. But i at this point in my life I'm not interested in money. I've saved up enough to support myself if things go to shit.

I have no idea if doing that will make me any happier but I need a big change in my life. New people, new eperiences, not just sat at a the same desk day in day out.

At some point in my life I do intend to return to some sort of career path but I need to be dead certain on what i want to do before dedicating years of my life to something. That could be a month or a year or ten years down the line. Who knows?

At the moment I honestly have no idea what that career path that will be. 

I'd like to know your thoughts?

What would you do in this situation?

What were your career decisions when you were young?

What do you think I should do?

Any input is approciated. "

10382,cbxfr7,TheMidnightLeo,Should I always get my mom's permission to post YouTube videos?,"Hi, I'm 30 years old and I wish to start a YouTube channel, but the thing is my mom worries about me attracting the wrong kind of attention on the internet. It's not that my mom is a helicopter parent, she respects my privacy, but rather she worries about me being targeted online by stalkers, creeps, weirdos, malicious hackers, shady individuals who want to use me for their own gain, pranksters who think it's funny to prank call a swat team into invading someone's house during a live stream! (it's not -\_-. It hasn't happen to me, but I have seen it happen in the past through compilation videos).

&amp;#x200B;

my mom is somewhat okay with me making YouTube videos, as long as I don't show my face. And the way she worries about me showing my real face in my videos has made feel this sense of guilt every time I even think about posting a video without having her review them first to see if it's okay to post on my channel or not. It puts a lot of unwanted stress on me, fretting about whether or not I should just deal with it and let her review all my videos until I have my own place, or if I should put my foot down and tell her that her worries have been putting unwanted stress on me. Also it doesn't help that I have some anxiety issues. I'm just afraid that if I do bring this up with her and ask if I could run my channel without this constant need for permission, she'll either say no, or unintentionally guilt trip me with her worries again. I know she means well, but all this worrying about my mom's worries about strangers on the internet is driving me crazy!

Am I being paranoid? or is it just the anxiety talking?"
18654,b5zm8l,JayKayVay,What's the best way to offer mental health resources to someone struggling?,"It feels weird that I don't know this, but I've never had to offer recourses like this to strangers IRL and although I suffer depression I can't imagine how I'd feel if someone did this for me...

I work for an organisation that provides legal aid to disabled people, homeless people, etc. A lot of our clients are going through a tough time and talk about being depressed, even mentioning feeling suicidal or joking about killing themselves, it sounds a bit unfeeling but honestly a lot of the time it's just talk and you can tell that's all it is. 

On rare occasions we have clients where it's not just talk, last week I had a client have a panic attack and talk about killing herself. I managed to help her the best I could but I don't feel like I did enough and I didn't have time to hunt down resources for mental health support for her. 

I've put together a pack with details for local mental health support eg. support groups, recovery courses, etc. And I'm going to ask my therapist for a few leaflets on getting help too. It's possible they'll never be used...but just in case. 

I'm just not sure how to approach clients about this to give them information on mental health support, I know how much I hate it when I'm struggling and people's response is to just give me a suicide hotline number (no validating how I feel or sign they actually give a damn). I don't want to risk insulting clients if they carry a lot of embarrassment about mental health issues, or have them laugh and reject help when needed.

So how do I approach this?"

Anyways our relationship got past the point of just friends but was not a romantic relationship. To be quite honest I did develop feelings for her later on but it always seemed like a bad time to bring it up. She dated a few guys and then graduated the year before me. She has a habit of dating very manipulative and controlling guys. Now she's engaged to a guy like that and she's constantly complaining about how she hates him.

She’s just kind of neglected and her family is quite poor. She is the middle child of 7, and the older three are just graduating, while the other three are 5, 2, and 6 months (she’ll be a junior in high school). This means she’s often not taken care of very much, and it hurts to watch. She has very easily damaged legs, spraining an ankle, breaking a bone, or some other injury about every three months, and sometimes her mother just wont take her to the doctor. And she’ll just be injured. She has cardiovascular health issues (gets as low as 41 and gets up to somewhere around 200 from just hiking up an easy trail), which she has not been able to get treatment for for several months. And to top it off, she has an eating disorder that relapses every few months, and her mother thinks it’s “for attention” and I seem to be the only one trying to help. And her home meals are never taken care of at all, with sometimes skipping one, two, maybe three meals at once. And when she does eat, it’s horrible food like a bag of takis and Oreos for dinner, cause it’s all she can get (even though she’s asked for different foods or to take her to the grocery store, literally anything she can get). I managed to stop her drinking, which was never bad but it was something, which is still bad, but I’m not sure what I can do to help. My parents won’t let us be together so I am limited, and additionally I don’t have a license cause I’m a lazy shit. So any advice on what I can do would be greatly appreciated, I want to help her cause she doesn’t deserve this and I don’t want the rest of her life to be destroyed by her shitty upbringing.

5714,czryok,Atomic_DogFur,I (F25) have only been with women for 10 years now I'm auth a man(M25) who won't have sex with me.," I've been with my boyfriend for about 2 years now and aside from this sexual problem our relationship is great. We cuddle at night and he kisses me all the time but the second anything sexual comes up he gets mad/uncomfortable. 
   The first 6 months of our relationship we had a really healthy sex life. Since I hadn't been with men we explored each other and had sex regularly with out issue. We both enjoyed it. Then it just stopped out of nowhere. If I try to come on to him he gets mad and tells me to stop or yells at me. If we are cuddling and I rub my butt on him he gets mad and turns the other way. Anytime I ask him about it he gets the most mad and says he doesn't want to talk about it. We've gone 8 months with out having sex because I feel so bad that I just gave up.the last time we did have sex he wasn't into it at all nor did he enjoy it. We did doggy for like 6 minutes, he came got up and left. I've even said he wouldnt have to do anything that I would just pleasure him. I told him I'd buy him pizza and beer if he'd let me give him a blow job and he still says no. I haven't tried since then. 
    He has made comments saying that my vagina is too tight and that it hurts him but I dont know how to fix that with out being able to communicate with him about sex. I want him to want to enjoy it. I want to be able to pleasure him. I feel like maybe my lack of knowledge about men might be it? Or that he is flat out unattracted to me."

14723,bqkwp3,PurplePizzaWolf,My father.,"I'm 14, 9th grade and I'm depressed. I mean actually depressed, with a reason for it. I'm in a family with my mother, my father and my sister. My father has bipolar. Type 2 I believe. He was a very nice happy man and still is if you don't live in my house, but has recently stopped taking his pills for it. This has greatly changed him. Just pointing out now, my sister (who is 18) is unaffected by any of this. He leaves her alone. Anyway, he argues with my mother and me every day, (but it's mostly me) about the stupidest things. Money, e.t.c. I argue with him alot more than my mother as I stand my ground and argue back. (I am in no way a bad kid, but when he is clearly wrong I will fight back). It is slowly getting to me. I am depressed because of it and it is affecting my learning. I am very soon starting my GCSEs. I just don't want to do anything. Not even play video games or watch TV or read a book. The only feeling that lasts in the one I get lying in bed on my own. It's the only place where I'm happy and I'm sure it's because of him. I don't even talk to him anymore. I've been going to jiu-jitsu 8 months and I've been loving it, but now I've stopped just because he takes me there and does it the same time. We argue on the way there, one the half hour drive almost every time. It was today I lost it. Yesterday me and my father went camping with my best friend's family and two others we knew. He was horrible the entire time. I was mostly sad because of it. It was on the drive back that I lost it. He was telling me how horrible I am to everyone and I have no respect for him. I exploded. I told him, he treats me and my mother like shit, I'll never respect him again. (I'm never going to respect him again as the Wednesday the week before, he strangled me after he lost his shit when I couldn't fix a cable and was telling me I was saying it on purpose. He still thinks he was perfectly right in doing so.) and I will never love him at all unless he changes some way. I know that really got to him, but he's not changing. He just thinks I'm being horrible again. He never considers being wrong when in an argument with me or my mother. Like he's above us but equal with my sister. (Mind, my sister is a lovely girl. Not stuck up or anything.) I don't know what to do. We aren't talking right now. I'll admit, I just want to get on with him. For ages I was angry at him for the way he acts. Now I'm just sad. I keep asking myself, ""Why does he act like this?"", ""How can I stop him?"", ""Am I really in the wrong here?"". The latter he often tries manipulating me into believing. I just want him gone, or to change or I'll go live with another family member. I don't think suicide is going to happen but it can, if he gets worse. I'm worried he will. He almost beat with a wooden stick the night he strangled me. I was in the corner of the kitchen, but my mother and sister (who were upstairs) stopped him.
For the time being, what can I do?"

Without thinking I grabbed it and put it back in my discreet hiding spot.. I am now sitting here trying to figure out 1.) why was it in there? And 2.) how did he even know about it/find out about it?

27536,8rk1to,throwaway32459683,"Brother has cancer, everybody saying I don't give support, am I in the wrong here?","Hello, so a bit of info about my relationship with my family, I am not the most social person when it comes to family. Don't get me wrong, I love them and respect them all and we talk when we sit down together, BUT I:

- don't call them or text them just to chat up/share a funny story etc. (even with friends I just text to schedule a drink or something)
- don't discuss my problems with them (neither with my friends), I like to solve them myself

So back to the topic, my brother was recently diagnosed with cancer (as I understand it seems to not be serious and is easily treated), mum was crying all the time constantly talking about cancer even to this day. I messaged my brother in the following few days as I wanted to wait a bit, because in my head I thought everybody was messaging him and stressing him out which would drive me nuts. So basically I said I'm there for him and that he shouldn't worry too much and to be positive as best as he can, messaged him a few more times before his surgery.


He is now recovered from surgery but is waiting for further tests. Mum seems to still be acting weird all the time, urging me to talk with him and ask him to go out for walks (we never did this and it seems to me I shouldn't start acting different because in my head it would make him feel weird and that I'm only doing this given the situation he is in). My brother and I chat when we're together and I joke around with him and try to make him laugh and bring a bit of humor to the situation. He seems normal just a bit down sometimes, I really don't want to talk to him about the illness because honestly I wouldn't want people constantly just repeating conversations with me about the illness if I was in his situation. 

My family is saying that I'm not a good person because of not socializing and being more empathetic with him. This makes me feel like a piece of shit, like I'm an outcast and some kind of fucked up psychopath, but my view is that we should act normal towards him, we should try and keep his spirits up and not just fucking talk about cancer all the time. Am I wrong for thinking like this??

**Please try to read the whole story**

**TL;DR - Brother got cancer, family says I'm not offering enough support nor enough social contact , I was always a bit asocial with my brother and feel that it is not good to force more talking with him now just because of the illness (i'm trying to interact normally with him and joke around with him like we always did, but cant help feeling like something is wrong with me because of my mum's comments)**"
20963,au0ffa,dammitqueer,How to get through college while severely depressed?,"Right now I’m a second semester junior at a mid-sized college. Right now we are about halfway through the semester, and I have probably only done 3 or 4 small assignments throughout the entire semester. Depression hit me hard last semester &amp;amp;amp; since then I have found it very difficult to get work done. I haven’t even checked my final grades from last semester, but I’m pretty sure I failed a class I need for my major. Right now my motivation to finish out the semester is at 0. I have work accumulating that I have 0 motivation to start, let alone finish. Lately I haven’t been attending class even though I have used all my free absences, but it is extremely hard for me to leave my bed to use the bathroom some days, let alone get myself showered &amp;amp;amp; ready for class. I missed a test, and have 2 papers that were due that I haven’t even started (on top of several other assignments) and my depression makes me not care about how far behind I’m getting. I know that I need to complete the work &amp;amp;amp; I want to, but as soon as I open my laptop to start working my mind goes blank and I just give up. The assignments are not difficult, I just have literally no motivation to do them. I am currently getting treatment for my depression, but I am not making much progress. I am also currently waiting to get psychological testing because my doctor &amp;amp;amp; therapist both suspect that I may have ADHD, but right now my only official diagnosis is severe depression &amp;amp; anxiety. I have accommodations from disability services that allow me extra time for assignments as long as I notify the professor ahead of time, but I don’t even have the motivation to do that. One of my professors has been emailing me asking why I haven’t been turning in work, but I haven’t gotten back to her yet because I am to scared and lazy to explain my situation to her. I want to be a good student, but it’s really hard for me to keep track of assignments and work up the initiative to start them.

6415,cvjazz,ElliRadd,What’s wrong with me?,"Hello. My name’s Elliot, I’m 14 years of age (15 in December). I’m making this post to ask you all for advice. I don’t know how many people will see this. Or if it will even be seen at all. But all forms of advice are much, much appreciated.

Around 2-3 months ago, I started to have explicit thoughts about harming others. They weren’t as explicit then as they are now. They started out as thoughts I’d get here and there. Eventually I started contemplating whether I was capable of murder or not. And with that question came even more homicidal thoughts. They because more explicit each time. One day I’d think about shooting someone. Then strangling. Then brutally stabbing. Then dismemberment. It became clear to me that I in-fact am capable of murder and what started out as small thought became strong urges and wants. I find myself thinking up new, explicit way to murder those in my household. It isn’t like I hate my family, I do love them but I can’t help these thoughts.

Recently it’s gotten really bad. I no longer think about  shooting or strangling people. My thoughts are always filled with blood and always have to do with a knife or a sharp object. Around a week ago, it started getting really hard to suppress these urges. I found myself getting up in the middle of the night and grabbing a knife. I just stare at it trying to stop myself from entering a room with a family member. Once I go past that line, I definitely won’t be able to stop myself. 

In order to take my mind off of these things, I developed a slight game addiction. But I found that every game I play has to do with sharp objects and racking up as many kills as you can.

A friend of mine helped me come to the conclusion that I am a sociopath. And while I know that you can’t diagnose a minor as a sociopath, I did have all the signs: I wet the bed past the age of 5, played with fire when my mother wasn’t around and (this was when I was younger and I wouldn’t do it now) I used to tie my old cat up in a pillow case until he clawed himself out. I also find myself constantly lying and and trying to get reactions out of people. I’m Especially good at forming a believable lie when I find myself caught up in something sticky. I’ll even lie when there’s no reason to. I’ve also noticed that almost all my relationships with people are a lot more beneficial to me than the other party. But I have concluded that I’m capable of having strong relationships even if it isn’t beneficial to me. But with this conclusion returned my thoughts of murder. Would I be capable of killing this person? Under what circumstances? After thinking I concluded that if the opportunity arose and I had to, then I most definitely would, and in the most brutal way possible.

I haven’t gone to my mother about this because I know that she’ll immediately send me to a therapist. I have no problem telling them about this, it’s being put on meds that scare me. I’d rather not have to take any kind of medication whether it would help me or not.

TL;DR, I’ve been having homicidal thoughts and in an attempt to suppress them, I’ve developed a gaming addiction. A friend of mine helped me conclude that I’m sociopathic. Is there anyone who knows what wrong with me? Even if you don’t please tell me what I should do. I don’t want to hurt anyone but I feel like it’s only a matter of time,"
33881,81r2sw,_cupcakewarrior_,May not be a good mother due to my past. Is there any way to help me?,"My husband and I started watching “Bob’s Burgers” last night, and I had a bad reaction to Linda telling her daughter to “show me” when daughter said she had an itch on her crotch. I didn’t think that was a normal reaction for a mom to have, to just say “show me.” My husband was really upset because he says that it is a normal reaction, and the right thing to do; that because it’s her daughter and her daughter (in a real life, hypothetical situation similar to this) trusts her enough to come to her for advice, saying “show me” is perfectly reasonable. 

I took a step back for a while and thought about it. I had a rough childhood where my mother had no boundaries and abused me. My body was not my own and my mom felt it was her right to see and touch my body whenever she wanted. For example, I wasn’t allowed to wash myself till I was about 16. Any time I’d take a shower, my mom would come in and make me let her wash my body, and if I said no, I’d get in trouble and there would be consequences. There were a lot of boundaries that were crossed, so now as an adult, I don’t really know appropriate boundaries. I’m learning though. I know my view on physical relationships between parents and children are blurred. If something doesn’t seem right to me, I ask questions because I really, really want to fix it. 

Anyway, I took a step back and thought about what my husband said, how a mother should handle this situation (and really what the definition of “crotch” is) and how I would react with my own future child. I came to the conclusion that I would react as Linda did, but maybe not as blunt as “show me.” I also felt like I would need to ask my daughter/son their permission to look (“Okay, well do you mind if I look to see what’s wrong?”). We still disagree on this, but moved on to a bigger issue. 

My husband feels like I’m going to the other extreme from my mom. Like I’ll be too timid with my children and won’t act as a mother should. He has/had a good relationship with his parents (one passed away) and he is planning on raising our kids similar to how he was raised. I’m fine with this, and have agreed to it. Anyway, I apologize for this being so long, but what I want to ask is: given my childhood and the way I tend to react by going to the opposite end of the spectrum from my mom, what can I do to help myself be a better potential mother? Books I can read, documentaries I can watch, YouTube videos, etc. I can’t really afford therapy right now, but that isn’t off the table for when we have a better income. I don’t want to have such extreme reactions. Husband is now concerned that I won’t be a good mother. He’s also, just as a side-bar, is concerned that I won’t be able to deal with his attention being taken away from me, so that’s something else I need to work on. I just really need advice on how to prepare myself to be a better mother. Thanks! "

24206,99amep,MysticalSong,My Dad Won't Stop Telling Me To Move Out,"So for context, I am approaching my 19th birthday and sophomore year of college.  Ever since I turned 18, my dad won't stop telling me to move out.  I'm not exaggerating.  Every conversation we have is turned into ""When are you gonna move out?""  He brought home pizza the other day for my family and he kept making quips about how I should move out and buy my own pizza.  Every time I see him after work, he says something along the lines of ""What is she still doing here?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I've told him so many times why I really can't move out and even if I could why I don't want to.  First off, there is no feisible way I can afford it.  I'm 18 years old, plus I am in college working really hard, and I have a job.  The big reason is that I have a form of autism, and I do not feel that I am emotionally ready to leave.  Last year, I went away to a camp where I spent a whole week several hours away from my parents for the first time.  I was with other girls my age and we were busy doing stuff from 7 am to midnight.  The whole time I was miserable.  I cried myself to sleep every night.  I called and talked to Mom (Dad was unavailable that week) two to three times a day every day.  The only things I would talk about were how much I missed my family and when would this camp end.  Dad and I have talked about it, and his logic is simply ""You're 18, get out of my house.""  I don't know what to do.  I miss my dad, the one I had before I turned 18.  We did pretty much everything together, and we were really close.  I don't feel like I have a dad anymore, like I live with my mom, 17 year old brother, and some guy who wants this random 18 year old out of his house.  Another thing is, if they said that I could stay if I paid rent, I would have no problem with that, as long as I could afford it, and I've tried to slowly get my Mom comfortable with that.  I feel like if I suggested that to Dad, he would say rent is $20,000 every week or something to get me to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Is there something else wrong with me?  Is he going to stay this way?  Can I still live at my house?  Will I ever get my dad back?  Is it ok that I am 18 and not ready to move out as well as having no desire to?  I can't take this.  I feel like if I moved out tomorrow, I would end up homeless, and dead via suicide within a month.

8160,cmn271,Killtheboy__,I feel lost. I don't know what to do.,"A few days ago I found that my husband had been sending messages to other women on reddit, I posted about it on here, in fact. He told me he was suicidal and since he has so many self destructive tendencies, I told him that if he wanted to work on us, the first thing I wanted him to do was check himself in at the e.r. 

He did and was transferred to a behavioral health hospital about 2 hours away. I'm not sure how long he'll be there, I'm guessing they'll probably discharge him in a couple days. 

He left me a voicemail tonight saying he was afraid that I wasn't answering because ""maybe"" he had done something else wrong. That really irked me, especially because in our big talk the night before he went into the e.r. I told him he had to come clean with EVERYTHING. He told me stuff, none of it too incriminating.

So tonight I went on his computer to see if I could find anything else out. I found that he had a kik account and a fet life account that he was inviting people to and then I found his Google voice number. 

There was a woman he was messaging on there that I believe he worked with a couple of years ago, and though because of what was said, I don't believe anything outwardly sexual had happened, he told her ""I wish I was still with you."" And said that if he left me, would she be with him? This was dated two weeks ago. Besides that, there were several other messages and voicemails from different women. 

I'm livid and so hurt. This whole time while he's been in the hospital, he's been telling me how much he loves me and misses me, how sorry he is for everything. Crying, sobbing. Horseshit. 

What can I do? The messaging was bad enough. It was the 4th time that had happened, but I just don't think I can live with this emotional affair. Or the compulsion to lie to me so easily, even when I'm begging him. 

We have a three year old, we only have one car, no money. I have no where to go and no way to get around since I don't drive. My heart is telling me to work it out with him, I'm still very in love with him but my head is saying ""get the fuck out.""

I have no friends that would be willing to put me up, or that even live in the area I live in. My parents could possibly let me sleep in their living room for a few days but it's a really cramped apartment. I just don't know what I can do."

I’ve done a lot of research and I was hoping I would already be clean by now, but I took an at home test and it showed positive. I have a lot of body fat, I’ve been working on my weight and have lost 15 pounds in a month but am still 185 pounds and a lot of it is honestly fat. I also know that my metabolism is not great, it never has been. I have read not to work out strenuously before a drug test because the metabolites are stored in your body fat and working out will only break down that fat and release more toxins into the urine/bloodstream. But I have two weeks or potentially more. Should I try to work out and sweat it out as much as possible? Will this help me detox? Along with drinking a lot of water and staying healthy, I feel like I may have a chance but not being clean after a month is a little worrying; I’ve read it can take up to 90 days to detox completely. 
The thing is: I can absolutely not risk a drug test failure. If I fail the test for this position, it will block me from positions like it and I have limited other options, so if I can’t detox, I will have to come up with some excuse to decline a really great work opportunity. Does anyone have personal experience with this and have any suggestions? It is a urine test but I cannot do synthetic urine or use clean urine that’s not mine, I HAVE to detox or not go at all.

1458,dllo7w,YecatsMailbox,Advice on how to deal with my ten year old's teacher? (Grade 4.),"Each week, my son's teacher sends home a homework packet. It includes a reading passage, followed by multiple choice questions, and then math problems. Parents are to sign that their child has read the passage 3x each day and completed the assigned math per day.  

  
During the first week, I noticed a lot of misspellings and typos in the reading.  During the second week, too. On the third week, I wrote the teacher I note. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said she should be proofreading the source she is using, because it's littered with typos and grammatical errors. She wrote back (misspelling my name and another word, I forget which, which leads me to believe it isn't the ""source"" - it's her) stating that all of the fourth grade in the school uses this material and she will look for something else.   


Week four, less errors, but still errors. Week five, more errors. Week six, still errors. We had a death in the family and my child missed school, so I just told myself ""we'll see what happens next week...""  Next week happened yesterday and the errors are ever present. I'm beside myself with what to do. I wrote his teacher a note today saying how unacceptable it is for the errors to still be there, that it's clear she isn't reading the material... and while it may be easy for me to read through the misspellings, it is not easy for a nine year old to do so. One of the questions after the passage has an option for an answer of ""because the ship was not making enough montu.""  I knew from reading it that it's a typo of money, but a nine year old wont know that. -\_-   


I'm so angry that I threatened if she doesn't fix this shit by next week, I am absolutely going directly to the principal. Seven weeks of errors is enough, and it honestly makes me wonder A) What's going on in her classroom? What is she teaching there? B) After graduating college, did she drop her standards? There's no way colleges would accept this type of carelessness...   


What more can I do? I may have come off a little harsh in my note to her this morning, but I feel like I have been too lenient in general. I did all but say she doesn't deserve to be teaching (what I really feel.) It makes me disgusted. How are you going to teach language arts with no grasp on English? How can she correct students work and criticize their grammar/capitalization/etc. when her source materials don't even have this done properly? &gt;\_&lt;"

Looking for suggestions on how to deal with this.","First, let me say that I've been taking steps to take care of myself. Speaking to a therapist. Exercise. Meeting new people. Etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in an abusive household. I tried to make it work with my family until my mid-20s. After that I severed my ties with them. My ex wasn't close to her family either, so it was just the two of us. My ex also kept us socially isolated. She didn't want to go out and meet new people. I'd focused on my marriage after that, and on my career goals. Earlier this year, the marriage ended badly. My ex and I haven't spoken. since the beginning of the year. Consequently, this is my first year without any family. My first holiday season alone. Add in that I'm also getting ready to start a new career and am getting ready to have a lot more free time, and it's left me feeling even more alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been rebuilding my life. Meeting new people. Joining groups. Participating in casual get-togethers with some people I meet in these groups. They are great people, and if I'm being honest with myself it's been a little difficult learning to socialize with people outside of work again. And despite all of their friendliness, they are not family. They also have their own lives to lead.

14692,bqqkq3,LunaSkyWitch,My 13 year old wants a YouTube channel for fun. I need advice.,"My son is a big fan op Papa Jake and game reviews on YouTube. He also watches a lot of creative DIY videos so that is basically the stuff he's in to. 

He made a video yesterday of himself swinging around a self-made sword and uploaded it without speaking to me first. It's really harmless and it was kinda cute but the thought of him opening himself up to the world, creeps me the fuck out. 

At what age do you guys think it's acceptable to have a YouTube channel and AITA for making him take down his video? I feel like shit thb. Before I did this, I anonymously subscribed and liked his video with all four of my profiles. That sparkle in his eyes made me so damn happy. 

Just a little back story on why I'm extra cautious. He has extreme ADHD and so he's very impulsive and doesn't think before saying something. His spelling (for titles etc) is not great either and he doesn't do well with criticism. This alone is enough reason I think. I mean, I've done my fair share of trolling back in the day, and so I know what might happen. 

Am I overreacting? Should I let him do it and just keep an eye on him? 

It's really bothering me because it's his dream to have a channel and become famous, and here I am, shitting on it. 

Please help?"
2841,dev2kr,FoxxTrott-,"I involuntarily avoid physical contact with my mom. No matter how hard I try to sit next to her, hug her, etc I just *can’t*.","For some back story, my mom has always been my best friend. I love her very much and I’ve always had everything I ever needed/wanted.

My mom and I were very close up until my long-time boyfriend and I broke up. She was more obsessed with him than I was. I was even convinced she cared for his feelings and well-being more than she did mine. When we broke up it was all about *his* feelings or how *he* was heartbroken. Not about how I was literally so depressed towards the end of our relationship I was almost hospitalized because of my doctor fearing for my sanity. 

Flash forward nearly two years later and I am in the happiest, most stable, healthiest relationship of my life and she STILL brings up *him*. She has him on all of her social medias and snapchats him REGULARLY. Now this wouldn’t be a problem if she didn’t tell me about it every time, as if I care. She’s talked to my new, better, boyfriend a handful of times in the year + we’ve been together. Yet, she talks to my ex almost weekly.

I feel like our relationship has gone in a downward spiral ever since. It’s gotten to where I can barely spend time with her because all she ever does is stare at her phone or talk about my ex. This has gone on for months and now she is convinced I hate her or don’t love her. Of course I love her, she’s my mother. But I can only take so much of being dragged back into my old, terrible, depressed self. I don’t know what to do to mend this relationship and I’m tired of hurting her feelings. Please give any advice you can.


TL;DR my relationship has gone down hill with my mother ever since my ex and I broke up nearly two years ago. She thinks I hate her and I don’t know how to fix our relationship."

25021,950sm3,suddenlyfriendless,Long term friends abandoned me,"Throw away.

So, without warning or explanation, within a week, my ""friends"" who have been happy to take advantage of my time, money, and efforts to be a friend to them, decided I'm now ostracized from them.

It took over a week to even get a half baked explanation of I'm ""a dick."" However, I wasnt a dick a week ago when they were drinking my rum at the lake.

Now they are going out without me, weekend adventures, drinking, whatever. Without me, excluding me on purpose even though I've been the one orchestrating events and inviting them to them for the last couple years.

I feel sick to my stomach and dont know what to do. My girlfriend has been helping me emotionally but this sense of betrayal isn't washing away. 

I'd hate to throw away friendships that I treasured dearly until a week ago, but it appears they already threw me away. What's worse is they wouldn't even know each other if it wasnt for me.

What do I do? Move? Been hanging with other people, but it's sad that I was calling them my best friends for years and they just dump me like that."
7169,crjjlu,slightpanicky,I just rejected a friend and now I'm panicking because I don't know why I don't share his feelings.,"Throwaway because I think he knows my account.

Giving people fake names so it doesn't get too convoluted. I am bisexual (this matters later on).

TLDR: I rejected my friend John and I compare him to my crush Jan. I realize they're very similar personality wise and wonder why I rejected him. I feel as though I am being artificial since it feels as though I rejected him for his looks. Now starting to panic and I have no idea who to turn to. 

For the record, I'll just say that my friend, John, handled it healthily but I still worry about him since he has had suicidal thoughts in the past. Please don't drag him down, he has done nothing wrong and I think it was brave of him to get it off his mind because he usually doesn't like talking about his feelings. As far as I know, John is not manipulating me in any way and he hasn't shown any signs of being an asshole. 

A few hours ago, I was talking to my friend over text and he told me his feelings for me. I apologized and said I did not feel the same way, but I hoped he would find someone that would fulfill that role in his life. John respected my decision and said he just wanted to get that out there. I couldn't bring myself to answer anymore because I felt uncomfortable and I didn't know how to continue the conversation. 

A few hours pass and I finally process the situation. I finally realize the impact of my decision and start to think about why I wasn't interested. First, I compare him to my current crush, Jan, who also happens to be my friend. Jan is fairly similar to John personality wise. So now I'm starting to panic and think that I wasn't interested in John because of his looks. I know I don't have to give out my attraction to everyone but I feel as though I am a one dimensional person over the fact that I rejected him when he is so similar to Jan.

 I feel as though as he is going to do something stupid because I rejected him. And what for? Why did I reject him? Why am I not interested? Why does making him smile feel less satisfactory than making Jan smile? I am clearly not rejecting him because he's a dude because I have had crushes on other guys in the past. Am I just a one dimensional person? 

I don't know, I need advice. I know it is within my right to reject him, especially since I don't have feelings for him. But I don't know why I don't have feelings for him, I just don't ever see a future where we could be more than just friends. Am I being one dimensional? Are these thoughts normal? How do I deal with them?"

3690,dagrx2,tahax283,I’m worried about the things I’m eating and the fact that I’m 20 lbs underweight.,"Hello everyone. I’m 17 years old (turning 18 soon) and for quite a long time I’ve been underweight. Most recently I’ve weighed myself to be 20 lbs underweight. My diet has been pretty poor as well apart from what I’m eating at dinner. For instance I hardly eat any fruit apart from the odd banana every now and then but I know that 5 a day is a thing. Once every fortnight or so we get strawberries in and I might have like 5 at the most. That is nearly the most fruit I eat.

How much protein do you think someone my age would need a day? Because I get hardly any of that as well. I have steaks every now and then but that’s about it. I am obviously getting protein from the other stuff I eat in a day but just in smaller amounts.

In general I just don’t eat enough and never have. I feel really lost as to where I should begin. Should I just eat as much as I can until I get a healthy weight and how much do I need to worry about all the nutrients as well? I don’t want to feel really stressed about eating as there is enough going on in my life right now that’s making me really stressed."

22112,9if4xb,CaptainNinjaKid,I can't feel comfortable in my own home.,"I live in California and both my parents smoke pot. I am not very good at organizing my thoughts. I have the fact that they smoke. Not because ""ooh look their doing something bad"" but the smell. The smell is so bad it makes me want to vomit. The nausea alone is enough for it to be an issue. I found out about 4 years ago. We downsized and they didn't have a big bathroom with a walk in closet to hide in. The issue is that now they are becoming more lax about it. My dad always takes a hit before driving (which makes me uncomfortable for it's own reasons) but recently he has stopped using mouthwash after making the car longer with the smell. I find baggies all over in random places. It's enough to make life bad on its own. In addition, they dragged me to a concert and the whole time all I could smell is the pot. I'm pretty sure I was effected by the smoke because I started hallucinating and became very paranoid. I cannot associate anything good with it. The level of dysfunction is unreal. I have never lived in a clean house. There is never any clear order to anything. It's hard for me and I can feel my mental stability draining. I've been in therapy before but we can't afford it. I used to agress my sister and the therapy helped a bit but I'm getting to the point where I don't know how I will react.  My mind will flash with ideas of horribly hurting people. I don't want to even explain how dark my mind will travel. I feel like food might have a key to play in how I feel. I'm always hungry. It's only every once and a while where we have nothing to eat and because we are at the whims of self employment our average income is too high for federal aid but occasionally the lows are really low. I am 110lbs at 5' 10"". Very underweight. We are always rationing food and my sister and I will often fight over food because one of us will eat more than allotted. A ""good"" meal is spaghetti and meat sauce, an average one is potatoes smushed in a pan with raw bell pepper and a a bad dinner is not having anything. I am often asked to cook because I will actually make a meal (if we have enough) but I can't always because I have school and college applications to get done. This has led to a lot of anger and depression which compiles with my ADD to where I get nothing done even though I want to. I feel trapped with only waiting as an option but I'm afraid I going to beat someone's head in with a hot frying pan before I can escape. How can I not feel lost."
15479,bmrq1s,AlacerTen,Boyfriend pretends to be a gay woman online and lies about experiences for karma,"Title says it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Unbeknownst to my boyfriend, or possibly found out by now, I discovered his reddit username. He posts as a lesbian. His top-rated comment, which he got gold and 2k upvotes on, was about bringing a girlfriend to a family gathering and experiencing discrimination for it. Spoiler: straight white dude brings white af gf to family. No one bats an eye (I am not his former girlfriend, I'm a person of color, so this kind of lying especially bothers me). Another one responds to the question "" What sorta problems arise in gay relationships that straight people just wouldnt understand?,"" with, you guessed it, total bullshit about ""working up the nerve"" to tell HIS parents that he wants to marry his secret gay girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

He. is. a. white. man.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why this bothers me so much, but it legitimately makes me hate him a little. Our relationship had issues at the start, including public nonacceptance and ways he was less-than-kind to me, which took forever to get him to acknowledge. He made racist remarks out of ignorance pretty often, which I'd be more forgiving of if I didn't find out that online, he plays himself the saddest little violin song on what a sad, persecuted gay lady he is.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I've asked, he's not secretly trans. He shows no signs of being trans. He legit just seems to bask in the attention of pretending to be a persecuted lady and crying foul on sexism to a degree that borders on feminazism.

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell do I do? Ask him about it? Ignore it? I don't like this side of his personality but it doesn't seem appropriate to just *spring* on him for it."

545,dr4mtd,TrentonJ,"No idea what's wrong with me, if there even is anything wrong or if I just think too much.","Hello everyone,

I'm hoping that this is the right subreddit to ask such a drawn out and convoluted question. Admittedly this is probably something I should be asking a therapist or psychologist about rather than Reddit, but hey, I don't have one! So here I am.

Quick background about myself: 23 years old, and I'm about to finish college next month and graduate with a degree, I've already been in my jobs ""field"" for a couple years now and will be moving up the ladder to something very high paying very soon. Grew up in Ohio until I was 14, then moved to PA and have lived here since. Currently with a girl who I've been with for about a year and a half. I wouldn't consider myself ""depressed"" as I used to have severe depression during High School as a teen, and what I feel right now isn't ***that***, but something strangely similar? I am not sad and don't feel any sense that I don't enjoy my own life, I just feel that the ""eagerness"" of my life has come to a stop and I'm not sure how to make it move forward again.

I am not quite sure where to begin, so I will summarize how I currently feel and then go more into detail.

**Weird state of Limbo, nothing of interest**

Basically, my life for the past year or so has just felt like a weird limbo where I'm just waiting for something to happen in my life. For example, when you graduate High School, you are now finished with that and are awaiting the job/college. Or whenever you go through a breakup, you're finished with the relationship and are awaiting the next one or enjoying life as a single person. When you move away, you've finished your ""life"" in that area and are awaiting all of the opportunites and people you'll meet in the next place. I'm sure you get the idea. 

However, in my current stage, I feel like I'm in a weird permanent state of limbo where I'm in the ""in-between"" where I haven't quite ""finished"" anything and there's nothing worthwhile happening soon either. However I feel that I'm at a point where I'm afraid I might be stuck in this state permanently. It's a strange sense of nothingness that feels infinite. This is only one of the many things that I feel are wrong in my life at the moment.

**Inability to move forward \[mentaly\], can't seem to put a seal on my past**

Another strange thing is that I constantly think about the past and, despite my life LITERALLY moving forward and moving up the job ladder and achieving great things in my life, I still mentally cannot seem to move ""forward"". I am not quite sure how to describe it, or what I'm having trouble ""moving forward"" from. Like I'm autonomously succeeding in life but deep down, I just seem to be stuck in a timeless limbo. It feels like maybe a couple years after I graduated high school is when the ""limbo"" began. To be more specific, I am always thinking about my more youthful days of Middle School and High School where I had A LOT of friends and it seemed that I was making new friends and connections nearly every single day. I also always think about all of the females in my past that have flirted with me or had taken an interest in me that, at the time, I was oblivious to and ignored. I think about all of the ""could have beens"" if I had taken my chances with one of them, or I will think about the friends and girlfriends I had in Ohio and how things could be different if I had never moved. I'll even go as far as looking up people from my past online and seeing that most of them are a lot different now, have kids, etc. And then I look at myself \[present day\] and wonder what they would currently think of me now. Not that it matters because we haven't talked in years, but I guess a big part of me misses everyone from my past. My friends, previous relationships, and even family members. I miss them all. At my current age, I only have several friends that I've retained from high school. Didn't make many friends in college because I just commute, and my co-workers, while we're ""friends"" we aren't ""outside of work"" friends so it's kind of meh.

Just as well, this year alone, a few people that I knew from my ""Ohio"" days have died which has put things into weird perspectives for me as well. One older friend died from a Heroin overdose, another from cancer, and another from what I believe was suicide. It feels strange for me for people in my past that I feel I haven't had ""closure"" with to either now be dead, or to be fully grown and have kids where it would be ""weird"" for me to reach out to them now.

**Finding my place in the World**

As I mentioned earlier, obviously I feel my life anymore is just a state of limbo where nothing of interest has happened recently nor will it anytime soon. I know where I belong in the world, as I'm making achievements in my field of interest. But despite my successes, I still just feel like It's whatever and doesn't matter. It pays the bills and allows me to do the things I love, but it just doesn't satisfy me. I am not meeting new people, I am not making any new connections, and everyone just seems to be too busy or caught up in their own personal stuff that makes it hard to really ""connect"" with anyone anymore. I feel like at my job I'm just co-existing with these people. There is nothing wholesome about it. It feels robotic, just as my life has felt for a while.

I should mention that I had a previous relationship for a long time that ended in 2017, and after that I did feel another sense of happiness because it was a sort of alleviation where I started hanging out with a lot more people, catching up with older friends and making new friends from those friends. At that point is when my ""social"" life peaked again and it felt like it used to, but then that sort of died down again once I got into my new relationship and now I am back to only really talking to the same 4 or 5 friends again and only seeing them maybe once every couple weeks.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I feel that right before I started college back in 2015 was the last time I had a huge ""motivational"" attitude and was happy and felt that I was really going somewhere. Then as soon as college started that feeling tanked and I've never felt like I was truly ""living life"" to my fullest since then. As mentioned previously, the only time I felt this feeling again was after my last breakup where I met a lot of new people after the breakup and made a lot more friends. But it has since gone away again and I feel like every day I am just doing the robotic dance of going to work and coming home and doing nothing. I feel lifeless and that I'm autonomously succeeding without actually feeling the mental reward of such successes.

If you actually made it through this post, I appreciate you taking the time to read it. Again, I know this is probably more for a therapist but maybe someone on here might know what I can do to move forward again. Thank you!"

Well this is the thing, i (M 23) met E (F 23), she have been the most intense relationship i've been so far, in so many levels, but since the beggining we've having a lot of problems, all because of me and my insecurities. things like im being jelaus with her, and she have been the most trustful person in my life, but i still feel very insecure about her going places with people, like no matter what the worst case scenario just stays there and i feel axious, i try not to act anxious like overtexting her, but still in my interactions, you can feel the insecurity.

i been trying self parenting methods, i've been trying isolating myself from things that put me on that insecure state, to look to the core of the problem and see if there lays the solution, im changing my enviroment, my workplace, my friends,  but nothing so far works fast enough or deep enough, its like, a short fix instead of a deep beneficial change.

and thats the other thing, everytime we have a problem i manage to understand the problem and formulate a solution, then i do the solution but, nothing really changes, and im not talking about her anymore, i feel like i dont change, like my insecurities doesnt leave, like my lack of empathy at the moment of thinking my actions doesnt change, im trying hard to stop being a child and start being a man for the benefit of my own life and the ones who cares about me but i dont find the way of doing it"

A few days ago, I have finally decided that I was going to end my life.

Around 9:50 pm, I set my Facebook account for deletion, and I've unlisted most of my videos from my Youtube channel.

I started typing out my suicide note on my phone but not too far in yet, my mom walked in my room and asked me what was wrong.

Apparently two of my friends (who knew about my current mental state) realized that my Facebook was deleted, and one of them asked my mom to check on me and the other asked his mom to phone mine. (because they're acquaintances)

Long story short, I had to open up and I sent them screenshots of notes on my phone (from September to that night) talking about how I felt and how it was affecting school, and my entire life even.

I told her that I wanted to go to a psych because this entire thing is making me actually lose my mind, and that I wanted to take meds because hopefully they could help.

She claimed that meds/psychs are just ""american bullshit"" (I'm Asian) and they don't really do anything.

I didn't question her anymore, but I've seen a thread on /r/AskReddit a few days ago and there were people claiming that they indeed do help.

Now I'm really desperate and want to try taking them in case they **could** ""fix"" me, but I'm also afraid to find out that maybe my Mom **is** right and that I would just make her waste money."

I am partial caretaker of my grandmother whose physical and mental health are failing. My husband and I are in the midst of the precious milestones couples go through - new house needing a lot of fixing, trying to have children, etc.

The stress has been getting to me. For about 6 mo I have been actively pursuing stress relieving activities - exercising, trying new hobbies, meditation. The last two months I've been seeing a therapist, anti-anxiety meds for a month now. Both my husband and I have been forced to change jobs when the cumulative stress between life and work became too much. This isn't about not being able to take care of ourselves or establish boundaries. We have a healthy relationship with my family and each other, it's just the circumstances are too much sometimes. 

Today my husband broke down. He's started associating me with stress. Even though I'm generally happy with my new job, I have a hard time dealing with even small frustrations. I am so stressed with life outside of work that I'm unable to cope. That means a lot of ranting, tears, and frustration with my husband as the shoulder to cry on. 

At this point I'm considering leaving my new job of ~2mo. It's not a perfect job, but I like it and it seems like it would be good for my career. We have the savings and my husband makes enough money to support us. He says he would not be stressed by being the sole breadwinner and I believe him. Mostly, it's my stress that's making him stressed. Leaving my job would give me some flexibility with taking on the things we're too stressed and exhausted to do now, but it would burn every bridge I have at the company and possibly even the industry. Am I looking in the wrong way? Should I consider leaving my job or should I continue to try to solve this in other ways, like I have been trying to? I don't want to leave my coworkers in a bad place, but I'm also afraid that I'm heading for a mental breakdown at this point."

3112,ddi8ch,RhightfullySoSoSo,A woman I work with smells horrible. I am a manager and I (and my colleagues) don't know how to talk to her about it.,"So this super nice, really great worker, just awesome personality woman started working for my company (large retail store) maybe a month ago. Everyone likes her, but everyone also has noticed that she smells incredibly bad. She has a very pungent, foul, far-reaching smell emanating from her body that spreads to like 15ft around her and lingers. We work in close quarters, and her department deals with customer service. She helps customers all day, and while she's super friendly with them, she absolutely reeks of intense body odor. It doesn't necessarily smell like she doesn't wear deodorant.  It's not feet, or any other smell that I can identify. It's maybe a mixture of like, armpit BO, dirty clothes, feet, female genitalia, dirty hair, pretty much every bad smell a body can have. I think it may be some kind of glandular issue. I knew a girl in my childhood who smelled just like her, but I knew her to be clean (or I think she was) and she maybe had some kind of gland disease. 

I've received several complaints and comments from the employees in her department, and I don't know what to do. I'm in lower management and the people in upper management don't seem to know what to do either. I think they're torn because she does great work, but it's very disruptive and uncomfortable to work with her. I, personally, if I spend too much time with her, develop a headache from the smell. I'm certain that customers don't like it, but is it something she can remedy? Bringing it up to her seems impossible, and I just feel so bad for her. She must be unfathomably embarrassed, and I'd hate to embarrass her further by asking her about it. It isn't necessarily my responsibility to do anything about it, but I'd like to know if anyone has any advice. Should we all just leave it alone, ignore it and suffer in silence, or should HR be involved and should we ask HR to do something about it? There is an anonymous hotline for employees to call and report anything they don't want to bring up to people who work in the store, and I've thought about calling it, but I feel like this woman has probably tried everything under the sun that could help her, and nothing's worked and she's just gotta make her way in the world with this horrible cross to bear, and getting the hotline (and the regional HR that the hotline tips go to) involved would just be a terrible reminder for her. What if they fire her? Should they fire her? What do you all think?"
12434,c1ehzk,Lvft93,Friends.,"I have a friend I've known since childhood. His ex girlfriend broke up with him last year. I've known her longer. I'm starting to realize why more. 
Because he disrespects women and is a perv and weirdo I brought up to him that I have reconsidered hanging out with him recently as he is annoying at times and also  can be really rude. 
Just because I call him out on stuff or he thinks I'm too nice sometimes he calls me a f** and that I'm g** and stuff. 
He tells me why doesn't he go drop me off at a bridge and actually tries to convince me sometimes. 
We've been friends and do help each other at times. I've helped his company he works at and also for free with things. Heavy lifting etc. Also business reports and coordinating which I can Excel at I think. 

I've taught him about stocks. Helped him understand how the stock market works etc and I help him a lot. 
He also tries to box with me for exercise but likes to start hitting me when I say no especially in front of his family. Sometimes just because he kept doing it I put the gloves on and did it and had to for fun or even defend myself. Because of him I've cut my head open before and also been punched In the face. When I choose to finally defend myself he realizes I'm trained in mma etc but I choose not to really use it. I injured my thumb for 8 weeks because of him and he can just be toxic. Idk what to do he's a bit of a bully and stuff but idk if I should stop talking to him. 

I've gained a lot of weight in the last few years and he makes fun of me in front of ppl. I'm losing the weight and have a goal to be in good shape again but idk. 

He said yesterday I'm too judgemental and that he feel he can't say stuff about women etc because I think he's being a weirdo and stuff because of the stuff he says. Also says he doesn't know if  my confidence is low or what but says stuff. He said things I've told him about how hes been acting bothered him but the thing is it's stuff he needs to hear. 

Anyways. Hope everyone is having a good day. Idk what to do maybe I'm being too nice."

18351,b7q59g,modernflorist,How to find friends that don’t party? (21),"I’m 21 and I’m pretty active usually. Mountain bike, surf, skate, whatever is really fun but those are my top. I have my own business and am very active in that. Though I work alone and at home so I don’t meet a ton of people. 

Seems all my current friends want to do is party. I’ve always been a partyer but recently I’ve been trying to get out of it. My pet died recently and I’ve been in a slump so I’m not doing anything active and am just watching anime all day. Watching anime enforces my opinion more too. I know it’s not real, but no one in anime goes out drinking to hangout. They hangout casually and just have a fun time. 

I do hangout w friends casually sometimes, but it’s never genuine and they always want to get high or drunk and go out. I hate to be that guy but it seems like it’s normal in our society. I feel I’m not building real relationships and it’s more of just a “we’ve been friends for so long, why wouldn’t we hangout” or it’s forced because we do the same hobby kind of. 

Seems like our friendship would just die or wouldn’t exist if we didn’t hangout or have X hobby. It feels like every relationship is fake and can just flip flop.

Anime relationships (I know, they’re fake. I usually don’t watch anime unless I’m depressed or down) just seem more genuine. 

I’m not sure how to express how I feel, but I feel like not meeting new people (because I work from home) genuinely is having a toll on me. I also don’t have 2 or 3 friends. I have about 5 close friends and 15 friends that I could hit up to hangout with. Most of the people I meet now though is mostly girls from bars and it feels so shitty. I like the hookup game, but want something GENUINE.

23066,9ex2ye,UnusualFault0,"A successful YouTuber has been sexting me, Unsure what to do.","Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I really dont know how I got into this situation but would love someones input on what to do.

I've been following 'X' since earlier this year and 'X' is a very well known Youtuber having done some high profile events recently. They currently have over 1mil subscribers and average at 600k views per video (just to give an insight).

I have always found 'X' attractive and enjoyed there content, I commented on 'X' Instagram photo with the emoji with heart eyes, I never thought anything of it, you see hundreds of comments like this on peoples photos.

'X' messaged me with a heart emoji, I was really shocked and actually began shaking receiving this message, this is someone ive liked for a while now and who im a massive fan of.. and it seemed surreal they would take the time to message me.

I explained im a big fan, thanks were given and 'X' asked me my age/location and for some photos. I sent some selfies, 'X' complimented me and then suddenly we began sexting. 

At first I felt very flattered, 'X' is very attractive but I quickly began to suspect if 'X' had been hacked or something? (they are verified on Instagram) I asked them to show me a photo proving it was them, they did (it was on a 5 second timer then dissapeared) but it was clearly a professional photo.

'X' then sent me a full body photo which was clearly them but concealing there privates, after this 'X' sent me another photo of privates but this photo again, looked like it had been taken off google.

I used image reverse and couldnt find any matches.

'X' has since asked me to visit there apartment, ive diverted the conversation because something doesnt feel right, going on gut instinct i did some facebook stalking and found out 'X' is married with a child but puts on a persona for there channel they are very much single. 

I really enjoy 'X' content and dont want to get into any kind of conflict.. however im really confused as to why 'X' is messaging an obvious fan when 'X' knows how profile people/ goes to high profile events and could pick anybody.

X has since asked me to record a video of myself saying there name so they can prove im real?

Where do i go from here? I've never been in a position like this before but it all feels very sketchy and surreal.. "
26563,8wqqrd,Venom_G,Love hurts. BAD. (It’s been historically this way),"So before I dwell into this I gotta put in some background around myself and the situation at hand.

TLDR at the bottom.

So I’m in my twenties and I have had a historically bad relationship experience, or even lack there of. I’ve asked out girls before and I’ve always been rejected, enough to the point where now I have a solid cast fear of rejection every time I’ve fallen in love. I’m not awkward going about conversations, but every single time I’ve been attracted to someone, I’ve been killed by the constant pressure of attraction to the person. In context I’m not an “unattractive” guy and I’m pretty fit, being a former football player, and I’m socially adept. I’m outgoing and can hold a conversation. 

This is huge progress in my personality considering I had a depression breakdown a long time ago that led to a suicidal attempt and years of therapy to fix my broken condition, that stemmed from a combination of my relationship experience and social experience. (Further background to why my relationship outlook is the way it is. I’m no longer in such a sunken place, that this would be a concern again.)

Now to the current situation. During my breaks for college I started to work at a specific sport retail store. It’s a pretty regional chain but it has spots all over the country. The store itself staffs like 20 people total and even though the cashier positions have high turnover I’ve managed to stay now for 3 years and gotten moved to heading one of the departments in the store. Out of all of my coworkers, a few of the women working there have caught my eye, especially one of them. She was working one of the other departments and while I was in school a year back she was promoted to manager. She’s only a few years older than me and we get along pretty well. In all honesty she holds me in high regard as a worker. She’s pretty outgoing as well and I work more comfortably with her than any of the other managers. So I’ve had this big crush on her for a while and I’ve been trying to cope with it ever since I noticed it. The reason for me having to cope with it is because she’s taken already. I’ve been trying really hard to lose the feeling and understand that’s she’s with someone but I can’t get over it ( it’s not obsession at this point at all, more like disappointment in myself for the situation at hand.) She’s been with this guy for a while, and she occasionally brings him up every once in a while in conversations, since I know him too. It makes it worse knowing that even I could go out with her, my schedule between school and my other responsibilities kills it for me. So my main issue is coming to terms with my feelings and how to get over them. I really like this girl and would love it if she felt the same way, but I’m afraid any kind of confession/explanation would ruin the work relationship and person relationship between us. Also another issue is coming to terms with my relationship experience as of now and how to move on from it.

TLDR: I fell in love with my manager at work although she’s taken already and I can’t stop thinking about her. I also have the worst possible relationship experience and need to learn how to come to terms with it and move ahead.

Thanks in advance and hope to hear from y’all soon. Appreciate all the help and advice."
29418,8hczyv,gigsllama,Should I tell someone that my boyfriends’s friend is contemplating suicide?,"My boyfriends best friend who just graduated college confided in my bf of a plan to kill himself before the end of the year if “things don’t turn around.” My bf has asked me to keep quiet, as he thinks his buddy is just seeking attention. I’m at a bit of a crossroads here because this friend has a history of partaking in risky behavior (ie. getting blackout drunk and driving, cocaine, etc). What really concerns me is that this friend is planning ahead (on the time and method), and is obviously going through a seriously depressive time...talk of suicide has turned into ideations, and my bf has no plans to confront his friend’s parents or school counselor or anything. I get that my bf knows his friend more than I do, but I don’t think he would ever forgive himself if his friend went through with it when he had the chance to speak up...I’ve discussed this with my bf and told him my thoughts, and he’s understandably worried he’ll lose trust and potentially a friend...at what point do you take it upon yourself to speak up with something like this, if at all?

35322,7wzen2,WeekndStarboi,I don't think one of my friend appreciates me much,"I should start off by saying Kyle is by no way a bad person, he's a decent guy, but sometimes i get the feeling i mortify him. I'm fairly comfortable being myself around him, and i love screwing with people so sometimes i try to weird people out by saying ""gay""/homoerotic, generic/stereotypical flirty things, neither of us are gay, we're both are interested in women, i just find it funny to do so and he knows it's a joke, i make these things as ridiculous as possible so people know it's a joke. I don't mean any of it, i don't find any of my friends attractive, but i find it funny to do these things.

But when we're around people who don't know me very well i behave myself properly, even so i just don't think he wants me around his other friends, Adam Bryan and Chris, who we share classes with and have sunday league games with. I've only ever hung out with him when we get food, never with Adam Bryan and Chris. And they're nice people, i'd like to be friendlier with them.

It's weird, he's given me advice with dating, hooked me up with someone, given me school/career advice, we've played video games together, things he's told me he really only does for friends. But sometimes i don't get the feeling we're friends. Like when we do hang out outside of school he'll happily talk to me, but when Adam Bryan or Chris are around, i feel ignored. And he texts me more often than i text him.

I'm not gonna cause a scene, but i do care about it. I mean why should i invest in someone if they feel ashamed?
If behaving the way i do is an issue, i'd be happy to stop saying those kinds of things at another person's expense."
12745,bzuw1z,sleepyyclouds,My OCD is getting worse and my mom doesn’t think I should be put on medication because of my doctor,"Around 1.5 months ago I had a doctors appointment and was diagnosed with OCD and when my doctor talked about the medication I could go on (Zoloft) I quote the conversation word for word: “The medication she could go on at her age is Zoloft but since you aren’t a big pill pusher I won’t write a prescription for it.” “Yeah I don’t want to put her on a bunch of medications.” My OCD symptoms include fidgeting in patterns and counting pretty much everything. My mom said to the doctor I would go to therapy but she yelled at me in the car ride home about how I was draining her of cash (check my post history for a better description right after it happened). I’m now at the point where I can’t sit still and it’s affecting my sleep schedule. First I talked to her about how I couldn’t sleep from fidgeting and she said I could take melatonin every few nights when it bothered me, I said it bothered me every night and she said she can just give me one once a week to see if that’ll help. Melatonin has always just been a once a night thing, just because I took it one night doesn’t mean it’s going to continue working the next night and she knows that. I’ve picked up more common OCD traits like brushing my teeth obsessively and my gums are raw and they hurt but I can’t stop. I don’t plan on telling her about my teeth brushing because she will just say that she never sees me do it so I’m just lying to be on medication. We can’t afford therapy at all (in the USA it’s about $115 per session) and we lost our insurance until August because of my dads job switch. Any advice on how to stop the compulsions without therapy or to ask her about putting me on Zoloft?"
23375,9d7u7r,arbes93,A good friend of mine told me that I am just a workmate for him - how should I act when he's around?,"Two years ago, when I started my Master’s degree, I’ve met a few guys on campus. With some of them, I’ve spent quite some time together since then. Further, we’ve been a group of 4 people who really did a lot together (like partying, drinking beer, going to the movies .. regular stuff). I am male, and the other ones are 2 males and one female.
Over the last few weeks/months, all of a sudden one of them started to act weird to me. He recently moved and did not invite me to his house yet, although he did invite the other two of our group. He started to take very long to answer on my chat massages and regularly just replied with a few words - he declined to accept my invitations to meet up and drink a few beers. I started to wonder what was going on, so I started to press a little harder to meet him, so that we can talk about why he’s acting so weird. He really got annoyed and rejected me pretty harshly. Since we were already texting, I asked him what was going on with him lately and why he is acting so weird to me - I asked him if I did anything wrong to him and that I just wanted to talk and stop fooling around like little children.
He responded to me, saying that he thinks that his actions were pretty consistent and that he always saw me more as an acquaintance on campus and a coworker (we work in the same company, I have recommended the company to him). That struck me pretty hard, since I’ve always seen him as a quite good friend over the last two years. It kind of hurt my feelings, learning how he thought about me.

Currently, I am a little confused - on the one hand, I think he is an asshole by suddenly acting so weird and then by being so non-social in telling me, that I’m just an “acquaintance and coworker” - on the other hand, I think that it is his good right to be friends with those people, he chooses to be friends with.

All this happened two days ago and I did not yet tell the other 2 guys in our group about this. What I’m especially asking for advice here is to how I should handle this situation further. There will be a day, when all of us 4 are together (since we are still both pretty good with the other 2 guys) and I don’t know how to act - should I also be an asshole? Should I act as if nothing happened? Should I act the same way he acts to me? Should I just ignore him?

I really hope you can help me further with this. I’m pretty sad that I’ve lost a good friend (in my eyes) and I don’t know what to do and how to act."

3352,dc69ew,kikhwa,I [18F] am having supper with a love interest (who was murdered)’s family next week. I’m not sure how to act at the table?,"Please don’t mind me using the present tense when I talk about my interest in him. I’m still not over him even if he passed 2 months ago...

To put it short, a guy [18M] whom I am interested in was unfairly murdered this summer. I met his family at the memorial and they found out that I like him and that he liked me (he talked about me to his little sister and his parents (didn’t include his dad in the title as his parents are separated but his sister told me that he asked his dad for advice on how to talk to a girl), they connected the dots when I explained in details my story with him). It was a long story about why we didn’t end up being official (his mom and sister know what happened but I can still explain if any of you are interested in knowing the teenage drama haha), and now I’m having supper with his family next week... 

I’ve been keeping touch with his younger sister and his mom, they know very well that I wasn’t official with him. I’ve hung out with his sister twice and visited his mom once and we spent hours talking. But now, I don’t know what we’ll be talking about as we already said so much last time I was at their place, I’m not really sure how to act as I didn’t have an actual full on romance relationship with their son/brother. I don’t have any stories to share as I already told them about our first and only date. I’m just overall extremely nervous. 

Any advice on how to deal with the situation? I really love his family, but I’m just really nervous, I hate that he isn’t going to physically be there with us for supper and that I met his family because he died (would’ve much preferred if we dated and he introduced me to them instead...) :( 

Words of comfort for the sudden death/murder of someone (that I really liked but never got the chance to be with and now hold a lot of guilt and regret for not trying harder because I found out after he died that he actually really liked me) would be appreciated too ❤️ 

TL;DR: I’m having supper with a love interest’s family, but that love interest has passed away and we were never official. What do I do at the table besides eating and sitting there awkwardly??????"

4526,d6ejvf,cptspinach_reborn,Should I move my family back where we just left? I need Career/Life advice please!,"I graduated college in 2015 when I was 30 years old.  I have a wife and three kids.  At the time, I was looking for any job that I could take to pay the bills.  Lo and behold, I was able to land my 'dream' job working at an OEM in Michigan.  It was at a company I always wanted to work for.  When arriving, we plugged into a great church, made some great friends and lived in a beautiful house in a really great town.  Unfortunately, Michigan was very far from family (My folks are in KC and my wife's family lives in Colorado) and the student loans I had acquired in college were stifling our lifestyle to the point that we couldn't go out and enjoy life.

Two years later, I took a job in Kansas that pays very well and located us closer to family.  I was able to pay off my student loans in a year and my wife is able to drive to CO with the kids at least three times a year to visit with family; none of these things could have been achieved in Michigan.  Unfortunately, it's a really boring/unfulfilling job in a dying industry (the reason the pay is so great is because they have a hard time keeping people).  Career-wise, it's not something I wanted to do and I don't see much of a future in it, but it pays very well.  It's a ""golden-handcuff"" situation.  Also, this part of Kansas we live in has a very ""Footloose"" feel to it (Mennonite super-majority).  We're having trouble making friends and fitting in.  Other than farming, there's not much to do.  However, the kids are happy and able to run around the property, but they're having trouble making friends also (still two years later).  

Now, I have been given a chance to move back to Michigan and work at the same company.  My family will be able to plug back into the friend group we left.  The only problems is that I will most likely take a big cut in pay, but I don't have any student loans anymore so that shouldn't be a problem, and we'll be super far from family.  Also, moving sucks for awhile and we're getting pretty tired of moving.

What should I do?  Try and live in Kansas and make it work or go back to Michigan and be far from family?  I don't see a win-win here, which sucks.  I'd love to hear from anybody in a similar situation or has gone through this in the past."
30734,8cgpdf,waterleaps,How do you break up with a friend?,"I've been friends with this girl for many years and she's stuck by my side through a lot of tough times, but she's always had a subtle mean streak that she refers to as ""brutal honesty."" Now, I assure you I can take criticism, but it's gone far beyond that. She's very condescending, with a really strong ""I'm always right and you're always wrong"" mentality. I've never been very good at standing up for myself so I've always just sort of taken her mean comments and hoped that we'd just be able to keep having fun together. But recently, the bad times have outweighed the good. She's in an almost constant state of hostility: snapping at me, telling me why I'm wrong and stupid, and insulting and belittling anything that upsets me (lack of money, shitty old car, minor complaints about school, etc.) by telling me that she has it worse, so I can't complain. It feels like I'm always walking on eggshells, I never know what I might say or do to make her angry with me next. I've also noticed she only acts this way with me, and watched her sincerely apologize to others for snapping at them once, where as if I seem upset by something she says or does to me, she tells me to suck it up or acts like I somehow brought it on myself. I'm hurt and beaten down, I'm becoming increasingly insecure and unhappy with myself as the constant barrage of insults is impossible to avoid now. Even my mother has pointed out to me that she treats me poorly, and she only sees us interact if we happen to be around her. and I've decided I need to get out, but I have no idea how. Trying to talk things out with her doesn't work because she always believes she's in the right, so I fear trying to repair the friendship isn't even an option. I'm just not sure what to do. Breaking up with a friend feels so much more painful than any romantic breakup I've ever experienced. I just need some guidance. Thanks. "

11895,c478aa,beaubandit,Relationship Advice,"Hello all, 

I am a 20-year-old woman dating a 19-year-old man. We’ve been together for about 6 months, and I love him with all of my heart.

I am incredibly flawed. I have diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder, PTSD (sexual assault years ago), and generalized anxiety. This is important, because I’m asking for advice on whether my perception is flawed based on my mental health issues.

My boyfriend has had family issues with his parents his entire life, and he has almost no social support outside of his friends and myself.

The other day, I was in my backyard with a male friend of mine. I recently started full-time school, and haven’t been keeping up with my friends, so he came over to catch up. He smoked a joint while we were talking on lawn chairs, and then I asked him to leave because it was getting late. I was sleeping in a tent that I had set up near the lawn chairs (fake camping since I am in summer school and this is all I’m going to get this year). When I got into bed alone, my friend came back and asked to talk about something that was bothering him, so I let him come in. He started kissing me forcefully and I just froze because my PTSD symptoms started activating. I felt like I couldn’t move, because I was so afraid he would hurt me. Anyways, I just laid there frozen and let him do whatever, and he eventually left.

After the incident, I immediately called my boyfriend. He was more worried about my safety than anything, and even offered to leave work to come over and be with me. I basically just cried non-stop on the phone with him all night.

In the morning, I asked him how he was feeling, and expressed how I didn’t want to pursue or discuss the incident anymore. I had a bad experience with the justice system before, where I didn’t have evidence of the assault and therefore was called a liar and completely rejected by my friend group. I was so afraid of calling what happened an assault, mostly because I didn’t explicitly state that I was not into it, because I was so scared. I know how the system works, I know that I would be dismissed again, and therefore my brain just wanted to forget it happened, block the guy and move on.

And just to be completely clear, I did NOT want what happened to happen, I just couldn’t move or speak. I was petrified because I was having flashbacks.

Because I didn’t want to pursue it, I believe my boyfriend thinks I cheated. He is now giving me the “silent treatment”, and we were supposed to meet up today but he won’t talk to me. He went out with one of his friends who is a girl last night, and to be honest their friendship has always made me uncomfortable. I don’t know if that’s actually founded, or just my mental health telling me not to trust him. 

Anyways, it’s been a few days and he is still leaving me on read. I don’t want to keep messaging him, because I don’t want to be annoying, but this man is literally the most important thing in my life. I loved him the first time we met, and whenever I think about my future, I think about him. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? Or even some insight I’m missing?"
5011,d3n7xo,PheniksB,Broke up... but she doesnt want to leave me...,"So i've been with this girl since march 2018 till december 2018 and gave our relationship a 2nd chance this year. We've been together and happy again for a few months before things were getting a bit more unstable. Now i decided to break up with her , thinking this wasnt how i imagined my future love life to look like. Now she sends me these messages where she apologizes for all she did wrong, effectively summing up everything where she went wrong. And asking me to give her a third chance at a relationship. And i honestly don't know what to tell her. It's not that i dont want to give her that chance. I just don't see any reason as to why it would be different this time...
Any advice for me on this.. i'm really at a loss"

He's the biggest sweetheart, absolutely gorgeous, tall, like over a foot taller than me, funny, and so much more but I need to get to the point. It sounds corny but I've never felt like with anyone or anything and it's true. Whenever he's around I can't seem to stop smiling. He also likes me. This started about a month ago. He was going through a lot and someone asked him out and he said yes. He doesn't like her though. Trust me, this isn't jealousy but she doesn't treat him right. He doesn't want to start anything with me because he thinks he'll hurt me. I talked to him about this. First, he told me that the girls in our school are known for throwing themselves at him, sending nudes, and asking for them.With me, I didn't do that. He liked me because I was just myself.I told him if I get hurt I'll be fine. I've been hurt before. I can handle it and I really want this. He said that if he is with someone else and talking to me and knowing that I want a relationship and that it hurts me, it will hurt him. I want to talk to him more about this because I want him more than anything but I don't know what to say. If you can help it would be amazing! And no offense but if you're gonna say something like move on don't even bother commenting because that's my very last option."

So the title says it all basically. Obviously I'm trying to get myself in some kind of a relationship with girls for quite some time now, but I always end up being dismissed. I can't even get an idea what I'm doing wrong, since asking this question directly leads to a ""lol you're just terrible, deal with it"" kind of answer. 
I've tried changing myself (both mentally and physically) to get a ""what girls usually like"" type of image, but all to no avail. I now start to wonder if that's even a thing or not. 
Not really trying to get on anyone's feelings or smth, but actually trying to get a useful piece of advice - how do I get over it? How do I accept that it'll take more than that to find that one person? It really matters to me you see. 
And also sorry if my English is kinda broken - not a native speaker by any means.
Thank you in advance!"
14338,bsdraq,kjjonsey,Relationship Advice,"I’ve been in a relationship for 9 mo starting in August when I first moved to uni. I’m 20 years old and I just left a very toxic religious family and ever since I met my boyfriend I have stayed the night with him almost every night. The only thing is I’ve been thinking every day about breaking up with him for months even though I care deeply for him and love him. He recently has been diagnosed with 2 different mental illnesses and I have noticed then since January but I just convinced him in April to get some help. 

He has been getting mad over everything under the sun since January. Particularly when it comes to me going to visit my friends, or family.  Sometimes i stay longer than planned  because he wants me with him constantly and it makes him mad whenever I’m not home at the exact time I told him about my plans. 

It’s just been things here and there that we’ve fought about I can’t name everything. I also feel like our relationship is one sided. He is always asking me to get things for him while he plays video games or Yugioh and I make every meal for him, I drive him everywhere, I’m expected to drop everything I’m doing for him, but I never get anything in return. Anytime I ask for help he complains and gets and attitude. Mind you he is a 24 yo college kid who still lives with his dad. 

I have to stay away from my home every night to stay with him bc he says I don’t love him or I want to break up with him if I stay the night away from him when all I want to do is go to my apartment I pay and work hard for. I feel like it’s not unreasonable for me to want to stay at my place and take care of myself and be with my stuff in my own room. I feel trapped in his house and I honestly hate being there. 

The biggest issues right now has been my job. I take care of people with disabilities and work a lot of overnights shifts bc they are long shifts but easy to do and I make a lot of money working them.  I quit my job in November bc of a traumatic experience and haven’t had a decent paying job for months and got behind on my bills so I gladly pick up lots of extra hours at work that has unfortunately kept me away from him 3-5 nights out of the week. He doesn’t have a job right now  due to his health issues so I feel like that makes him miss me more since he has so much free time. But I can get nothing done between taking care of my clients at work and then going to be with him immediately after work and take care of him and basically be his maid until my next shift.  Sure we hangout and have fun a lot of times but it’s mostly on his terms. 

He does ask what I want to do sometimes but I feel likes it’s just  so he can say that we don’t always do what he wants to do. And when we do do what I want he complains the whole time making me feel like I don’t matter. And anytime I don’t do anything for him “I don’t love him” and anytime I try to compliment him or try to feel loved he says I don’t mean whatever I said and I wanna he with so and so instead. I really don’t want to be with anyone else. 

I love him but I’m 20 years old and haven’t been able to hangout with my friends or family hardly at all or focus on myself since I’ve been with him and I’m sad and depressed all the time. I feel worthless and like I don’t matter bc he is so selfish and toxic to me. I cry every night bc I feel unloved. He never pays attention to me. He is a media/ journalism student at uni and is constantly glued to social media and games. And he blows through my money asking me to buy him stuff all the time when I’m barely affording to live on my own while his dad is a billionaire basketball coach and he lives at home and his dad gives him money all the time. I’m also the one who has been buying groceries for him even. 

He doesn’t realize all that I do and go through just to try and keep our relationship going and fix it. He’s been going to therapy which has helped but he also talks to his therapist about me and she says that I’m in the wrong. I’m just exhausted putting my feelings and myself to the side just to cater to him to avoid conflict. It’s very tiring emotionally. I’ve broke up with him several times but then he coaxes me to come over and talk it out  and we end up staying together.  

I guess if you’ve made it this far thank you and my question is should I stay or go? I was happy once in our relationship. I still am happy sometimes but I feel like I ignore the problems to make him happy and end up causing myself to be more miserable. I’m very bad at getting how I’m feeling into words and my boyfriend is very intelligent and good with words. He works at the law school and can argue I way through almost any fight we have and always put the blame on me. He is sweet sometimes and I do believe he cares about me but I think our relationship is too toxic. He’s in therapy and taking meds so I’m hoping things will get better once he manages his mental illness. We have really good days on the days he has therapy and it gives me hope but then we get in some stupid fight again over something I did that displeased him. 

Please leave your opinions at the bottom. Is this relationship worth it or is it too toxic?"
7372,cqqw0h,Queen_RD,Should I stay or should I go,"HELP. I lived in Florida for the majority of my life but at the beginning of the summer, my sister helped me to move closer to her up north. At the time I was in need of a change due to a breakup so this worked out well. In Florida, I worked for a great company (target) for 4 years and became very close with the management. When I moved up north I was able to transfer to the store here. I have been here about 4 months now and I am loving the city I have been staying in. 

A few days ago my old boss texted me asking if I’d like to move back and work towards a promotion. I was very excited, I feel I really deserve this and was excited at the thought of growing in the company. (Not much chance of a promotion at the northern branch, it’s much MUCH smaller) I have one more semester left until I graduate from university and it is my main priority to do well and focus on it (online so I am able to move anywhere and do class). Because of this, my old boss said it would be alright to work hard through the semester to prove I’d like the promotion and then jump into it after I graduate. 

There are a few downsides to moving home as well as positives. If I move back to Florida, I will be living with my parents which will save me A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT of money. This summer, I have been putting all my money towards rent every month to be up north. The downside to this is my parents are not the best to live with, they are both supportive and loving but they do not get along and there is a lot of negativity in that house. It is also a small Florida retirement town, there is not much to do for someone my age (23) compared to the city I have been living in over the summer. Also, my sister lives up north and she’s my best friend I love her very much, it’s been amazing being close with/to her again. 

I have worked out 2 plans in my head but I really don’t know what to do. 

1) Accept that I’ve had an amazing summer experience up north, move back to Florida, work hard at my old company, work harder in my classes, save alllll my money, graduate university, get the promotion, gain manager experience to look good on resume, and then move either back up north or somewhere else to find other work. As much as I love working for target and feel I deserve the promotion, I don’t want to work here forever and I do not want to live in Florida forever. 

2) stay up north, transfer stores because I really don’t like the one I am working at, continue doing my school work, and then find other work when I graduate. 

I’m probably missing a lot of details but I am very stressed about this and I’m having trouble. I have to make a decision within the next few days. I told my old boss I’d let her know at the end of the week and my current landlord needs to know if I’ll be signing a lease. 

Any input helps."

He’s had constant tantrums as a kid, screaming in public, hitting me, spitting on me, punching me then as a preteen-teen years I resented him so much I was never nice to him and everyone friends and family would get so mad at me for being rude and I’d cry in my shower because they didn’t understand how hard it is growing up with a sibling with asbergers. He would come in the room and make fun of whatever show I was watching, spit on me, walk behind me and scream in my ear, itch his balls then touch our food in the fridge and if I ever said anything I was so evil and my dad would be like “you’re going to regret being mean to him when your older” but I’m older now and I don’t regret it. He screams everyday at my dad , hits my mom, not to mention he’s obese and if he doesn’t get food he throws tantrums and claims he’s suicidal. He’s so much stress on my family I hate it I don’t want him around. He’s leading my parents to a divorce and only cares about himself.

31687,88wy4k,-Okakuni,I've realized that I am emotionally dependent on my boyfriend. How do I help myself?,"I've known for a while now that when I can't spend time with him and I get depressed, it's a bad thing. When we're apart, I have no motivation to do anything else: I don't want to do any work, I don't want to play video games, I don't want to do the things I'd normally enjoy. And I knew that it was a bad thing. He's even pointed out that he didn't expect me to be this emotionally dependent (I'm an independent person in day-to-day life) and so now I've actually put that to some thinking.

Apparently I emotionally cheated on him with another guy friend that I could spend more time with when he was busy. We have already talked about it and have worked through it.

The day after spending the day together, I cried 10-12 times because I missed him. And a part of me knew that it was bad. I had just seen him the day before, how could I miss him already! I used to cry whenever our calls would end, and the loneliness would sink in. Which is why I'd spend time with other friends when I couldn't spend time with him, but that led to spending a lot of time with a certain guy friend, which led my boyfriend feeling like he was being emotionally cheated on. (He knows it was slightly unreasonable since if it was one of my girl friends, he wouldn't feel that way. Like I said, we worked through it.) But it makes me paranoid now that I can't spend time with any other friends out of fear that I'll end up hurting him.

I never wanted to ask him for more attention or demand he talk to me more because I knew that that was unhealthy, since the amount of attention he was giving was perfectly healthy. But at the same time I wanted to. I just didn't want to be ""that ex-girlfriend who was clingy and crazy,"" so I didn't ask. I don't want to be clingy. Especially when he's told me about an ex of his that was extremely clingy.

I know there are things that are a sign of emotional dependence but there are still other things that prove I love him. I thoroughly enjoy the time I spend with him and I love him for who he is and not because he loves me, and if I think about breaking up, I'm sad because I'd be losing him, not because I'd be single. I know I'm not in this relationship for the sake of being in a relationship.

I just want to fix the emotional dependent parts. I've read a few things that say that I have to love myself and become the person that I would want to love me, for myself. This will lead to being able to be comfortable in solitude, and be able to be comfortable away from him so this can be a healthier relationship. But I'm not exactly sure how to do that. I hope I've said enough.

How can I become more emotionally independent?"
6379,cvrj92,twerkingnoises,My 11 year old autistic son is being bullied in Middle School. He is being physically assaulted and I don't know what the best actions to take are. What can I do to help him?,"I don't post at all or even comment often but I have been a part of the community for years and made an account less than a year ago. I am not even sure if I have enough karma for me to post this and it not be taken down. I am really hoping it will stay and I can get some advice. Also I am sorry if this is long. I am just beside myself right now and really need to get this out and get any advice I can. I thank everyone in advance for any help you give today. 

Basically as the title says my son is 11 and high functioning autistic. I am a single mother and have always done everything I possibly can to help him succeed in life. I have always worried if this day would come due to him being diffirent and what I could do to help him if it did come. Welp, he told me over the weekend he was being bullied for the last 3 months of the school year last year, to the point he was being assaulted daily.

 I just got off the phone with the middle school and was a bit disappointed with the response. It seems their main way to handle this is to try to seperate the boys who pick on him by just scheduling seperate classes from him. They said because of the length of time since the bullying they may not be able to reprimand them at all but they will talk to them.

 I see them being spoken to by the school without consequences as a means for them to retaliate and get even worse with my son. He is more scared of that than anything which is partly why he waited so long to say anything(due to his autism he has a hard time communicating to begin with). He does not want it to get worse and is scared it will now that they will know he told on them and I agree with him. 

I know it is several months after the bullying but I want those kids to be reprimanded. I want to be able to pursue whatever I can to get these boys punished to help deter them from continuing this and let them know they will have consequences if they continue. If I can get the police involved I will. Honestly if I could I would beat their little asses. I won't but I wish I could. 

They made my sons life a living hell for 3 months to the point I put him in counseling because he was getting so anxious, self loathing and depressed(of course I did not know then that this bullying was going on). It isn't just 3 months for him either this continues on for him. He hates himself now and his confidence is just gone. He is scared to go back to school which is why he finally decided to tell me. I am absolutely livid and scared and feel powerless to help my son. I am so angry at myself and filled with so much sorrow at the thought that he was dealing with this alone. I failed him and will be damned if I continue to fail him. 

There are 3 boys. The first one (he doesn't know this boy's last name)punches him in the arms over and over again literally daily, he doesn't talk to him just hits him. My son had come home with bruises all over his arms several times last year and when asked about it he would refuse to talk about it. He can be pretty active and clumsy so I was a little concerned about it but he gets a new bruise almost everyday so I didn't think much of it. It was not something I thought could be caused by abuse at the time. I so deeply regret not pushing harder about it and pursuing it more. 

The second boy(my son knows his full name) daily called him gay, a homo and a fag because my son has long hair, he calls him a girl and gay because of it. My son does not get his hair cut because of his autistic sensory issues, he cannot stand it at all. The third boy(his name is known too) threatens my boy. He aggressively tells him not to look at him, not to talk to him. He threatens violence if he does. All 3 of them are friends, egg each other on and gang up on him together. 

All of this stuff was happening in class. Not the halls, not the cafeteria, not after school. These little shits were doing this right under the teachers noses when their backs were turned. So I am not exactly confident in the schools ability to protect my son. I want to make sure I do everything I can to protect him and put a stop to it. 

All this being said I absolutely appreciate any advice that is given. I need advice about what I can do to help my son cope with this emotionally at home(he is still in counseling). What he could try to do when the bullying is happening. Advice about how I should handle it with the school. Advice about if I can get police involved in this or not. 

As I said, just incase this info is needed, my son is high functioning autistic. He has had all the treatment and therapy I could get for him for his autism and no longer is in any. He does not have an IEP or anything like it. He excels academically and now his main struggles are sensory, social and fine motor skills. He doesn't qualify for assistance or therapies as he is not ""disabled enough"".

TL;DR: High functioning autistic son being bullied at school. How can I help him and pursue safety for him at school and consequences for these little shits? Also sorry for any errors  I am a bit of a mess right now."

28558,8lrvvn,RandomBelgianMan,"[23M] My girlfriend tries to ""test"" me and I'm not sure what to think about it","I'll start out with a little bit of context, I'm a 23 year old male from Belgium and I've been in a relationship for only 1 month now. She's had some moments where she would feel like just giving everything up once something was bothering her or just being really emotional but for the most part we get along great. And I understand this, women are ususally more emotional than men.

Now for the advice, Yesterday we didn't see each other we were just chatting and really having a good time. And suddenly she says she needs to confess something and she said she cheated on me, the first week when we were together. I asked questions like, do you still hear him, how long did this go one, etc and said that I needed some time.

Only to be followed that it's just a test and it was to see if I really loved her, naturally\(at least I think \) I did not like this test and acted reluctant and hesitant to reply other than just saying that I was shocked and that it's just not something I appreciated. We didn't talk much more during the evening, because I was gathering my thoughts and she was mad because I didn't trust her enough anymore which I find really hard only 5 minutes after what she just did.

I guess I'm just asking for advice about people with similar experiences, if these things would occur more often or if they could be one off things, because like I said we did get along great there's just sometimes these moment's where she doesn't seem to think and just let her emotions take over."

I always though i would just get over it as I got older, but it just didn’t happen. I meet this guy and we became very good friends and I thin well this might work so after almost to years we decide to be more than friends, but take it slow. 

It didn’t work. I know I didn’t give it a very long time, but I panicked and broke it off.

Today I broke it off with the guy I thought I could like. He is very nice and sweet and I wish I loved him. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t even do it face to face. I feel horrible. But in the few weeks we got together I just couldn’t relax and was nerves about the relationship. He didn’t take it as well as I had hoped. He felt a lot more for me than I for him. 

He wasn’t even the sexual type. And didn’t push me to anything.

Anyway, I think the problem was my relationship to intimacy that made me so nerves about it all.  And the fact that I don’t really know when I like somebody. (But that wasn’t what made me nerves )

I’m not from a religious background and my family or social circle is  anti-intimacy.

I did walk in an my parents one time very young. (I watch sex education. I don’t know if that reaction is real or anything?) and the in on my mother and two diferente boyfriends, two de different times. (She didn’t take two at the time just making that clear) but I was solder thoughts times.

I don’t know how to get over it. Any advise? Maybe there is a better subreddit for this?"

2897,demk9w,jlitofrm4th,Going to jail on Thursday and don’t know how to break it to my loved ones.,"So I’ve had an ongoing case for about nine months. My lawyer had told me all I had to do was have a stable job &amp; do community service &amp; do therapy.

I held a job, though not on the books, for about 4 months. Then lost the job. Found another and lost it too. Recently tried to get my licensing and training in a field and completely flunked it. 

Did the therapy though it took me a few months to find the right person have been seeing her for maybe 4 months now. 

Did not do the community service.

Now I’m sort of resigned to the fact that I’ll probably be sitting in jail by next week, and I don’t know how to break it to my mother and my girlfriend and my friends.

I am at a complete loss at what to say to my loved ones. How do I explain that my incompetence will now lead to my incarceration. How can I explain to my girlfriend that even though I love her and I want to be with her, my actions have led to show otherwise? How can I find the brass to ask her to wait for me when I have no idea how long I’ll be away. How can I look at my mom and ask for her to live long enough so I’ll be able to go to her house and eat with her again. 

I’m so lost and don’t know what to say.

30040,8eplj9,ohmygodwhyme,I don’t know if my boyfriend is emotionally abusive or not.,"Background: Previously we dated for almost 3 years until he broken up with me over text around midnight out of the blue. He would text me about how he was hooking up with this girl I was told not to worry about during the relationship. Three month later we got back together and have been dating for 6 months now. 

He’s just plain mean. I don’t know why but it’s his first instinct, I’ll get him something nice for him like his favorite drink or snack and he’ll say something like “wow couldn’t get anything better? thanks” and won’t laugh it off or anything. He also knows I’m self conscious about my weight but will make fun of my round face and call me a whale or a cow as a “joke”. 

He starts arguments and makes it clear he doesn’t trust me with money. And after he makes me cry he just “apologizes” in a way that’s like “well I’m sorry YOU feel that way” or “I’m sorry you think I was mean”. I don’t know if he just words it wrong or what. The money I could understand if it was like $50 or more but, he lent me four dollars for a drink once and constantly harassed me about paying him back a day after he gave it to me. He isn’t short on money, trust me. 

He always hints to talking to the girl he was with over the summer even though I’ve asked him to never talk to her again, because what he did to me with her really fucked me up. On my birthday he told me he was coming with a gift to make up for his behavior, but he showed up 4 hours past the time he said he would with not even a card, he played fortnite the whole time.  I love fortnite!! I always ask to play it with him but he says he’s busy or that he doesn’t want to have to carry me, but I’m actually kinda good!

He also brings up things like I’ll never be a woman like his mom or that his mom is the only person he cares about.

Maybe it’s just a phase and I’m overly sensitive, but I’m not happy and I just want help. I want to know if I can still be in this relationship or what I can do to see what’s wrong. We talked about getting married and he wasn’t like this before. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. "
6934,csopue,nyteee1,What do you call this?,"Hi Reddit... I'm in a situation right now.... I'm both shaking and completely static.

For a while now, I'd say 2 years, ive(17) been getting these sort of episodes.

These episodes consist of me coming to the scary realization of many things.

The fact that I fall for people too easy. The fact that I don't eat enough and am probably slightly underweight.  The fact that I'm not happy with my body, that I don't like the person I am right now. 

I start thinking that no one, no matter how much they say it, cares about me and will drop me as a person at a moments notice. That they are only dealing with me because I exist. I start telling myself that no one likes me and that everyone would be better if I was just gone and didn't exist. 

I start think of myself not as a human but more of a mistake and can't believe it when people say otherwise. I end up feeling alone in my own body and getting eaten by everything around me despite me putting on a brave face.. what do I do?"

She was friends with some girls I thought would never talk to me, and they were actually super sweet. I had a lot of fun, and the girl gave me a blue glow bracelet and said, sarcastically, “Be spirited!” This isn’t going to happen everytime, but it will for a lot more than you think.

We have 2 small kids and they have never been vaccinated. I have, for the most part, been indifferent about the topic, but I’ve been thinking about it more and more recently and find myself disagreeing with her views. 
I went to the doctor for an unrelated issue and the doc mentioned that I hadn’t gotten the Tdap in a long time and asked if I wanted it. Thinking my wife wouldn’t even know and thinking about my children’s safety, I said yes. 
A few weeks later I got some mail from our insurance provider and she opened it. It had the information from my Tdap shot. Well, she freaked. This sparked an argument that left me upset and wishing I had more information. 
I still don’t understand the ins and outs of vaccines, but honestly trust the medical community over what my wife has found online from anti-vaxers. I mean, you can find whatever you want online, and she wants to find the bad, so she finds it. Her dad, someone i see as the smartest person I know,  is also anti-vaxx which is where her fears stemmed from. 
We’ve never argued like that... she told me that “we wouldn’t work” if I “allowed that stuff in our home”...  it was rough hearing that and I can’t shake the feeling. I need help. 
I need some information that she can’t dispute that shows the positive effects of vaccines. What common things do anti-Vaxers point to to ‘backup their position’ that is completely false? "

It's fun to dress up with on special occasions, and I admire people who use it to express themselves, but I hate wearing it every day.

No matter how much sleep I get or what my health is like, if I'm not wearing make-up, someone will almost always comment on my ""health."" I am  pursuing a more professional career now where it's almost an expectation, and I also value my career. Most of the women I work with wear make-up every day. The ones who don't are butch or have the sort of naturally alert features that let one get away with not wearing it more easily.

32158,86y05g,Inlovewithaprince,Abandoned my internship halfway through. Should I finish?,"Okay, I'll lay it down now. I'm a horrible person, I know.  

Background: I got a paid internship with a company run by two people, the boss and my supervisor. I was in charge of developing their website through research and writing. It was hard to focus, but I did the required hours for two months.  
 
Then my supervisor quit because she and the boss didn't see eye-to-eye on something. Suddenly I wasn't required to come in anymore. The boss wouldn't be there when I could, so my supervisor told me to keep working from home. For a while, I did. But I started putting in fewer and fewer hours, until the final few weeks, I wasn't doing anything at all. The boss never contacted me except at the end of my four-month internship period, when he emailed me to keep working for him. I realized he must not know that I dropped off. I told him the truth, that I hadn't been putting in the hours for a while and that I shouldn't be paid for the second half of my internship (the first half was paid in advance). He never responded. Later, I discovered he blocked me from the company Google account. However, he hadn't blocked me from the website.   

Anyway, it's been months. The work that I did do was shared with him, but I didn't finish all of it or put it up on the website. I got paid for the work I did, didn't get paid for the work I didn't, but I still feel guilty. I need a full-time job. Someone who works at really good company has been encouraging me to apply, but I feel like I don't deserve it. And yet, I don't know if the boss wants me keep posting stuff on his site. It would take a couple months to do the work, no pay; I'm not going to pretend that sounds appealing.

Rentals are expensive because of this location, but we can afford it. Yet we keep applying for places and losing out to other applicants. I am completely, totally stumped. 

We have very little debt, save for my student loan which has about 10k remaining on it and one car that is nearly paid off. We have substantial savings. Our combined income is around 135k/year - granted, most of that is his. We're aiming for a place around $2800/month or less. 

We both have great, if not excellent credit with no history of late payments. My score hovers around 749, his is a ridiculously pristine 825. 

The only thing I can think is causing issues is our lack of rental history. We've been living in my late grandmother's home (owned by my parents) essentially rent free for the past 8 years. It has allowed us to save a lot of money. If we were staying around here, we'd be looking to buy without issues. 

Before that, my husband's only 'rental' history was his college housing, and mine was a tumultuous living situation with an abusive ex boyfriend that ended in me moving out and being  removed from the lease at my request and for my own safety after he physically assaulted me. I have some rental history before that, but it was literally 10+ years ago and I've long since lost contact with the landlords.

34494,7zo5q5,PayterG,I’m getting separated from the Marine Corps due to my depression and I don’t know what to do with my life,"Hey everyone

As the title says, I’m being administratively separated from the Marine Corps (General Discharge) due to them deeming it was in their best interest after seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist for my depression

I’ll give a little bit of a backstory here

I am 19 years old, and I’ll be turning 20 next month in March. I enlisted in the summer of 2016 2 months after I graduated high school and went to boot camp February of last year. I earned the title that May and went to Camp Pendleton’s school of infantry a few weeks later when I became an 0341 (infantry mortarman) 

Depression has always run in my family, and I noticed once I began training, my mood has progressively been getting worse. At first, it was me just losing interest in my hobbies and sleeping 14+ hours on the weekends, but then came the thoughts of helplessness and feelings of not wanting to be alive and overwhelming feelings of sadness.

It hit an all time low after my unit returned from Christmas leave. While I was home I felt like me again, and I felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long time. I got to see my family and my girlfriend(bless their souls, their support has helped me tremendously),but on the first night back I began crying for no reason. As I continued to cry, I became overwhelmed with the strongest feeling of not wanting to be here anymore. I woke up some of my peers at that point because I was scared out of my mind and didn’t want to do anything rash.The following day I went to our regiments mental health care clinic and they started me on Anti-depressants and counseling. Fast forward a few weeks and my unit leaves for a month long field training exercise. 

Long story short, during that training period I became suicidal and came very close to overdosing on my medication. They put me on suicide watch for about a week and sent me back to the barracks early so I could get treatment. After speaking with the Psychiatrist and psychologist again, they decided to make the decision to separate me and send me home. I’ll be getting out in a few months

I have mixed feelings because I know once I return home I’ll be a lot more stable and it’ll be manageable, but at the same time I don’t know what I want to do with my life. I’ve always planned on going to college after my enlistment, but just finding out I’ll be getting out in a few months, I have no idea what to do with my life or what I wanna study in school. I’ve never felt so lost in my life and I don’t know how to find purpose or meaning in what I wanna do or become.

Any kind of advice would be helpful and greatly appreciated "

25687,91dtfd,Eeeemurs,[Serious] I can't take it anymore. I'm being eaten alive.,"**tl;dr**: I have a rare genetic disorder that makes me attract flies and mosquitos like crazy. I live in an arid desert climate and I have bites at the end of every day, from only being in my car and the grocery store. I'm followed by flies constantly. No one can seem to help me. I need new tactics. 

Sorry for the dramatic title, I'm just in a lot of pain and I can't stand the psychological torture of this any longer. You know mosquitos? They're unpleasant and kind of potentially dangerous, right? You know how flies are annoying? There's something worse than both of those, that many people have probably never met. There are these flies that prey on mammals, mostly livestock. You can tell them from the others because they're silent, and they are impossible to swat. You have to have two people and hit them with a spray bottle from multiple feet away to incapacitate them before you can kill them. I don't live near a barn yard or farming area, but I have bites from them every day, and sometimes they even breed nearby after they get a meal from me and I have to kill 20 of them. They fly directly at you and then crawl around under your clothes and bite at hem lines, leaving massive red welts that itch like crazy for days. 

I also attract some of the normal ones and mosquitos. I live in a very upscale place and if you met me you wouldn't necessarily guess that I have this problem. The stalking flies, bites, and risk of disease haunt me every day. I wake up itching or being bitten. It's almost as though they can see me from a long way off, because they find me and follow me everywhere, no matter what I wear or where I go. There is a medical explanation but I don't feel that it's important here. I've consulted with physicians, farmers, exterminators, and people who produce pesticides. Nothing really works against the bad ones, is what I've been told. I literally have a full body net suit that I wear when I travel in the tropics, but I don't want to have to wear it at home. Can someone, anyone, please tell me how to deal with this? I know it sounds ridiculous but this is a real problem for me. Thank you, sincerely, for any advice or observations. "
4049,d8jef9,sologhost1,Am I getting older or do movies suck now?,I'm a huge fan of both Terminator and Star wars.  I grew up with both and have seen every star wars film since 1997 and Terminator movie in theaters on opening day.  But this new Terminator movie looks good I'm worried it will suck because the last 3 were awful.  As for Star wars the Last Jedi ruined it for me and I'm not excited about the rise of Skywalker.

35427,7wpkva,shreddedzippers,Mom pressuring me to finish Master's degree by 25,"The current point of conflict between me and my mom is my completion of grad school by 25. 

I am 23 and finished my undergrad in December. I've been researching which schools to apply to in order to make a decision that best suits my needs. I wanted to wait until July to begin grad school since I can get tuition reimbursement from my employer after July 10th while being a full time employee. Other family members say there's no rush to finish or apply grad school and that I should take the time to save money, get my life together, and evaluate what I want in life.

I personally think my mom's pressure on me to finish grad school by 25 is a little ridiculous, but she says it's so my life will be ""on track"". 

We have a history of bad communication, partly because she is very culturally Chinese, and because we're both not very good at expressing our points at times.

How can I explain that I dont need to finish my Master's degree at 25 and to politely ask her to stop calling every 2 days to criticize my progress?"

Okay, so there is this girl I've met in uni. We were both freshmen at the time, and we had a lot of classes together. When I first saw her I felt like I was in some cheesy romantic movie: I was stunned, stood there like a retard with his thumb up his ass, and my friend had to call my name twice before I could react. She was amazing: she wasnt the typical hot girl, more like extremely cute. I thought to myself ""I'm gonna marry this girl."" Then during classes, I noticed that she was looking at me a lot. Like, an unreasonable amount. She didn't look away right away when we locked eyes either, she just smiled and then looked away. We had to give presentations, and she was looking at me while I was doing mine, while everyone else was looking around bored, or just sleeping in general( I dont blame them, the topic was very boring). And when she was doing hers, she switched between me and the teacher, she didn't even look at the class. So I was pretty damn sure she fancied me too, and we started talking. As I soon found out, she had a boyfriend (still does, same guy). I was devastated, and to not make it look like I was hitting on a taken girl, I immediately shot down my advances. We were still talking, looking and smiling at each other, but I have given up on asking her out on a date. Until one day, she did. She asked if I'll go to this party on wednesday, and when I said I dont think so, she said that I really should, and she will be there too. I said fuck it, I'll go. So I went out on wednesday, met up with her earlier, and we walked to the party together. There we spent 4(!) whole hours talking, laughing, and getting to know each other. And we found out, that we had ridicoulusly lot in common. She liked the same music as I did, same tv shows, same movies, both of us had similar hobbies etc. It seemed like we really hit it off, we both seemed to have a really good time. She took off relatively early because she had classes tomorrow morning, so I walked her to the tram, got a kiss on the cheek, and she left me there with my heart full of gooey, cheesy romantic thoughts. She absolutely, and irretrievably claimed my heart, and when I went back, my mates told me I was looking like someone who just won the lottery or something, because I had a smile as big as the Moon. I went home not long after too, felt like there was no point in staying anymore. Then months went by, we still talked regularly, I still didn't make a move because of her bf. I invited her to a few parties, she accepted a few times, seemed like we were stuck. One day, I couldnt take it anymore, and asked one of her friends on facebook about her relationship with his bf. She said they've been together for almost 2 years, and they seemed pretty serious. They both are really religious, and travel a lot together. I was pretty damn sad to hear this, and tried to like limit our communications, so I could try to start to forget her somehow. It worked somewhat, I still dreamt about a timeline where her bf never existed, and we were living happily ever after. It helped that she switched universities halfway through the year, so I didn't see her at all after that, we didn't even talk outside of a few declined invitations on my part. 8 months went by, and it was the October of 2019. I wasnt thinking about her actively anymore, she sometimes just popped into my head every few days or so. And then two days ago, I saw her on the tram. She was as beautiful as ever, and my heart stopped when I saw her. She noticed me, and she had a huge smile on her face. She didn't come over, just kept smiling, and switching between me and the window. She got off a few stops later, and I immediately started thinking about her again, like the last 8 months didn't even happen. The feelings I had last year came back as strong as ever, and I'm feeling like shit currently. How will I able to forget her? She still has her bf, I see their pictures on social media, and I dont want to be a girl-stealing guy. I can't hit her up, but I can't forget her either, I just feel like we still have something to do with each other in the future.
She also made my love life impossible, I've tried dating other girls, had a few dates, one night stands, but in the morning I always felt like shit, so I stopped trying entirely. Will I ever be able to forget her and move on? Or will this happen every time I see her somewhere for the rest of my life? Please help if you have any piece of advice, or idea or something, I'd really appreciate it. 
If I had any grammar mistakes, please forgive me, english isn't my mothertongue."

20423,awist4,bi_and_ready_to_di,Mother's friend emotional manipulated me into thinking I was in love with her son. How do I overcome the anxiety and trust issues it caused?,"I already posted once on here but this has been eating at me for so long i need some advice. 

I'm not going to go into the full story because that's just too much to read, but I'll give a quick summary: my mom had a friend who decided she had to have me as a family member, so she started emotionally manipulating me for three years (age 7-10), putting her own idea of what love was in my mind and convincing me that that's what I felt towards her son, and once she'd gotten that idea in my head she started convincing me that I needed to marry her son.  The manipulation got really bad when I was 9 and 10 cause a tragedy happened in my family and I was depressed and easy to mess with.  Worst part is I started to believe it and I probably would've been completely under her control if she'd been around for another six months.  I don't even want to know what she did to her son to get him to act the way he did towards me. 

It's stupid but that whole situation made me incredibly distrusting, and anxious.  It also caused quite a bit of depression.  I'm in a loving relationship now and my boyfriends amazing, but I just get so confused by my feelings sometimes because I had this false idea of love put in my head for so long, real love is scaring me.  Any advice on dealing with this? "

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety over a year ago but feel like I’m starting to make progress with that. However, there is still this complete feeling of dread. As time slips by, it feels as though everyone and everything is moving faster than I am, progressing whilst I’m stuck in some kind of bubble. I am so afraid of dying, of death. This where my anxiety and panic attacks stem from. I can feel time pulling me forward and I can’t keep up, I’m out of breath but it doesn’t stop. It scares me that our time on earth is finite.

We've been friends for several years but we've always butted heads: We're both very stubborn and very opinionated, but we always agreed on the big stuff: politics, morality, etc. But we've been prone to a lot of misunderstanding and it was always small, stupid shit that we fought over, often because one of us felt disrespected. I feel like our big problem is that I am emotionally sensitive and I admit that, while he is emotionally sensitive and won't admit it, so I never know when I'm stepping on a sore spot because he doesn't bother to let me know until it is too late. By that point he has already ""returned fire"" over my initial blunder and then at that point, feelings are just getting hurt on purpose out of some sense of retaliation, like a ping pong match of passive aggressivity. I think he simply feels like I don't respect him at all but I don't feel like he respects me either, and I'm really at a crossroads because of it. I DO respect him - less so, recently - but I don't know how to convince him of that. Thoughts on how to proceed?

27436,8s1bg5,IamP,How can I punish a Mexican hospital for extortion?,"
TLDR:  Hospital visit in Cancun ends with hospital extorting my mom for $7K+ after threats of jail.  I'd like to find way to prevent this from happening to others and make Amerimed hospital in Cancun be punished for their crimes.

Recently my mom was on vacation in Cancun Mexico and ended up in the hospital, where she was essentially robbed by the Doctors and administrative staff.

A little background; a few weeks prior to the trip my mom was in the hospital for a breathing issue and was later released.  The root cause was never fully understood, so she was keeping an eye on things.  You should also know that my mom sometimes has seizures.  Not the convulsive type but more absent.  The root of this is still not understood, but she has not had one in a couple of years.

While in Cancun, mom was having a little trouble breathing the first couple of days, but it was manageable.  Then she had one of her 'spells', as she calls it.  Her travel buddy had never seen mom have a spell, so called an ambulance.  This is a reasonable response when you are frightened for someone’s life.  However, in Mexico you may want to consider rolling the dice because this is where a relaxing vacation turns into imprisonment.

Upon getting to the hospital, the immediately ask for a credit card so they can put a 4K hold.  This seems reasonable since there is a possibility of skipping out on the bill when leaving the country.  All the while they are doing this, they tell my mom that the accept her insurance provider from the United States.  I'm still not sure if that is true...but time will tell.  The credit card was supposed to only be a hold for what the insurance did not cover.  Still no red flags, but my mom is being a little cautious.  She tries to ask what things are going to cost and is denied any details as they go about performing tests and giving medications.

At this time, I'm informed of the situation from my sister, so I can help get her airfare to go help out.  I help her and start to look up information, so they know what to expect.  I talk to my mom and sister and warn them about multiple reports of hospitals in Mexico extorting Americans and holding the hostage until they pay some ridiculous sums of money to settle the bill.  I pass on what information I have about the scam; threats of jail and keeping your passport until you pay up.  This is paired with information about how they cannot arrest your for not paying and have not right to keep your passport.  I assume I'm being paranoid, but next day my fears were realized.

During the time the Dr tells her that she has pneumonia and will need to be in the hospital for at least 3 days.  Pneumonia seems possible with the breathing problems, but my mom is worried about what this is going to cost.  She does not have much money, so was very concerned about how she was going to pay.  The doctors and nurses refuse to talk about how much anything is going cost but continue to put drugs in her IV day and night.

My sister and aunt arrived as planned to help my mom the next morning.  At this time the hospital administration presents them with a 5K bill for services and explains that this does not yet include the doctor fees and some other stuff.  They also tell them that it will be ~4K every day she is in there.  At this point, my mom wants to leave because she knows she cannot afford this service.  She had accepted losing the 4K deposit depending on what the insurance covered but did not have sufficient balance remaining on her credit card to pay the additional 3K they were now demanding.  She asked to be discharged immediately and explained that she did not have the money to pay the 7K that they were demanding of her.  At this point the following happened:
	* The doctor told her she would die if she left and told my sister that it would be on her hands when my mother died.
	* The doctor told her that he would put her on the no-fly list, so she could not go home.
	* The nurse refused to remove the IV.
	* The administration stated that she could just stay until she could pay.
	* Doctor and Administration threatened to call the police and have the all arrested for not paying the bills (yes, all 4 people in the room).
	* My sister says there was a large man posted in the doorway to intimidate them.
	* They threatened to keep their passports and not allow them to leave the country.

At this point, I tried to explain to my sister that she needed to have mom remove the IV and walk out of the hospital.  She was a nursing assistant for a number of years, so I knew she could put in a IV which is harder than removing it.  They were frightened due to the threats of jail.  I gave my sister the number for the American Consulate, so she could get information from them about their rights in Mexico and confirm that they could not be arrested or held hostage.  Sadly, my sister did not follow through with my suggestions.  In the end they transferred money to my mom’s checking account and used a debit card to pay the additional $3K so they could gain their freedom.  The next day the hospital attempted to 2 more charges of $2K apiece from my mom’s checking account.  It was at this point she finally called to block the charges and attempt a charge-back on the previous charges.  Since everything they did was shady she even filed for a charge-back on the initial $4K to her credit card.  I think she has a chance of getting the Credit Card charge reversed, but my understanding is that debit card charges are much more difficult.  Even after she placed the hold on her debit card they attempted at least 2 more charges of 2K each. 

My mom is finally home safe and had a chance to visit her doctor.  He informed her that the 'antibiotics' she was sent home with were nothing more than antacids.  He also fears that she was drugged by the hospital to make her more pliable.  She did hallucinate the night after she left the hospital.  Further, he said while the x-ray shows something that could be pneumonia it was nothing that would warrant hospitalization.  He feared that they would have killed my mom in the process of robbing her.

After all of this, I'd like to make them pay in any small way I can.  I suppose blasting them on the internet is a good start, but does anyone know more official channels I can take to punish the hospital, so this is less likely to happen to others?

After the dude took a shower (which he brought a bottle of whiskey into and then left filthy) she took him god knows where.  She was drunk and we told her not to drive but also that dude could not stay and she was really stubborn and drove off with him.

throughout the month, i would describe myself as generally anxious but nothing too unmanageable. i have an amazing relationship with my SO and we are pretty much always having fun, making each other smile, just generally having a good time. 

but the few days before my period are unbearable. even though i know exactly when it will happen, i am never prepared. i completely lose control over my emotions, so much so that it physically hurts. it goes from paranoia to blinding rage to suicidal ideations to crippling depression and hopelessness in any order, any span of time. i don’t know what to do. i’ve had this issue for years and nothing has worked—antipsychotics, antidepressants, antianxieties, a number of therapists. my wallet has run dry trying to fix this and i can’t afford to take any more medical steps but i definitely can’t afford to be hospitalized again. the only thing i have is a brand of birth control which takes the edge off. 

i am not asking for medical advice here, i’m just giving background first. but if there is anyone who has this issue, or any input, i need help. i know exactly when i will have a breakdown and it never gets any easier and if i am left alone i self-mutilate before i realize i am doing it, but my SO has his own life. i hate that i go on a self-destructive rampage and don’t know how to stop it even when i know it’s coming.

and please. do NOT tell me to go to ER. i have done that so many times, it is worthless and i can’t afford to lose $3k to be told i’m crazy, or $20k to be hospitalized."

6865,ct5qgs,cinnamonotter22,My mother is ruining my credit score,"Please no comments about how I’m being an enabler by continuing to let this happen....I’m really just seeking advice how to approach this.

About a year ago when my mother had fair credit, she bought a Jeep and a few months later,crashed it. She still had payments to make on the car but didn’t have the money for it so she got a lot of late payment marks which tanked her credit. Few months later she filed for bankruptcy and she needed a new car. Of course it light of all this, loaners avoided her like the plague. At the time I had good credit and she was desperate to get a car, so she asked me if I could apply for a car loan for her. I did of course because she’s my mother and she’s helped me out countless times. I saw no harm in it, we agreed she would make the monthly payments, every time, on time. So far so good right? Few months later my sister crashes the new car. (She was totally fine) My mom however paid off the remainder of the loan, so any financial ties to that car was out of our hair. Or so I thought....the loan company gave me a call and said there were 5 missed payments!! My credit score went from almost 700 to 615. I was absolutely livid. Thankfully but unfortunately, they charged off the account to a collector and the missed payment penalties were taken off my record. (I’m still paying monthly amounts until the rest of the $1500 loan is paid off because my mom can’t afford it). Fast forward to now...I once again had to apply for a car loan for her &amp; now she has a car that is thankfully still intact. But she hasn’t made payments since May!! The Loan company keeps calling me and I’ve asked her when is she gonna pay because now my credit is tanking as I’m trying to build it!! I’m only 23 and to think that my ability to get an apartment or refinance my car is in jeopardy because she’s not making her payments is infuriating and terrifying!! I don’t know what to do!! I can’t even cover the payments for her because I’m paying for her old loan, my car note, insurance and other bills! She just got a new job and isn’t making that much...she’s paying off her bills too but It’s so fucking frustrating and really taking a toll on me. My anxieties been through the roof. I love her and want to help her but she’s killing me! Any advice is appreciated. Never been in a situation like this. Thanks a lot"

One of my best friends, we'll call him Evan, hasn't talked to me more than 5 words at a time for 8 months. I had no idea why, until yesterday when one of my other friends told me. She was talking to Evan, when he said that the reason he wasn't talking to me was because 8 months ago he came over to my house for a sleepover. Now my house isn't dirty or anything like that... the issue is that we are both gay. I don't have any feelings for him and he doesn't have any for me, so I thought it would be fine. But my dad thought otherwise. We were hanging out, and my dad enters. He started having ""the talk"" with him and it immediately got really awkward. After ""the talk"" there was tons of weird energy and I apologized a lot to him, he said he didn't care, *but* he got a ""text from his mom saying he couldn't sleep over anymore,"" which was fine. He started to seperate himself from me and I had no idea why until now. I miss him in my life and I was wondering what I should do to fix the friendship?"

13159,bxtmnu,lahsop,"[WARNING; MENTIONING OF DRUGS]I need help ASAP. Apologies for the long post, if needed screenshot and comment later.","This post does not infringe any of this subreddit’s rules or regulations.

I had a friend (I’ll call her B, her first initial) go to my school (high school, freshman year) for a while and she was a year older than me (sophomore). We were great friends for a while but then one day she was using a juul while we were eating lunch in the *MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY*. Anyways, I had never seen one before that point but I knew it was something she shouldn’t have had. I ask her about and she starts promoting it talking about how it “tastes good- like mengo” and “if you try it, for the first week your throat is going to hurt but it is worth it.” I ask her if she could bring it the next day for me to try it. 2 *WEEKS* later and I have my own and have been caught with my own juul in the school bathroom vaping. My parents knew I was antisocial and that this had helped me socialize, so they said that as long as I told the truth and promised not to do it again, I wouldn’t be in any trouble. 

Sense I still had my phone I filled in B on what happened. She continued vaping in front of me and after a week or 2, I went back to using her vape. Fast forward to the next week (2 or 3 weeks after I got caught) and she had asked me if I wanted to try a wax pen(weed extract in a specific vape). I said sure because she had once again talked about how it was *soooooo* good for your body (it is good for you to a degree, but she made it sound like it was god himself healing someone). She took me to meet her friend where she had traded her juul and $20 for the wax and two cartridges (which I’ll refer to as ‘carts’). 

We end up trying it together and from that day on we smoked everyday. One day, however, she admits to me something that scared me. She was addicted to heroin. Now, if you ask literally anyone who knows B personally, they will tell you she is a chronic lier. However, someone in my close family is a full time lawyer who is *AMAZING* at telling when people are lieing. He would even tell me how he knew I was lieing to him when I was little. Because of this, I am usually able to pick up on peoples patterns of how they act or react when they lie. With B, her puples would change in size and her eyebrows would go up and her voice would become quiter and lower pitched. She had lied to me about major things in the past before. She had once had a sniffle at the beginning of the school year and had sniffled and said “f***ing kemo. Did I tell you I have lung cancer?” All this happened half a year ago and I saw her recently (more on that later) and her hair hasn’t changed, she hasn’t had anything past a minor cough, etc., but I knew instantly she was lieing. 

Back to the heroin, she *WASNT KIDING*. She even FaceTimed me once and she had shown me her needles. I told her to stop and talk to someone about it and all she did was keep using. Over the next two months we start dating, we eventually break up and stay friends, everything ok, we’re still smoking her weed with her, and one day she disappears. We normally walk class to class and sit at lunch and before school together, so I was confused when I didn’t see her the next day. Or the week after that. Or the *MONTH* after that. I get a phone call from a mutual friend and asked him what’s up. Then I heard B with the friend on the other line. B told me about how her parents caught her using a needle with a line of cocain on the table (Her parents knew it was cocain because they hair tested her for several drugs, and marijuana, cocain, and heroin pop up positive). Her parents took her out of school for the rest of the year (this was during only the first semester of school). 

At the time I was going through a vary rough time because (1.) rumors were going around that B had done heavy drugs and nearly overdosed after I had broken up with her so a lot of people stayed away from me or called me a jerk and/or monster and (2.) I have depression and being alone (at lunch and before school) makes depression worse. I’m not proud of it, but while B was gone, I tried meth and had a (luckly vary short) addiction. I also got my own wax that I vaped daily just to put up with myself and if I didn’t have weed daily, I would be depressed or need to be drunk. I told B about this and she *said* she didn’t care at all about the meth or weed, even though this was still going on. We started talking daily through the mutual friend and she eventually called me through a different mutual friend and said she needed to speak to my parents(This was all happening a week or two after I stopped doing meth, and she had done worse, so I was almost certain she wouldn’t snitch on me). I was confused why, and why she sounded kind of scared. 

As you can guess by the red flags, I was hesitant but ended up giving my parents the phone. She was on speaker and told me to leave the room. I was almost certain she wouldn’t have but she did. But he told them that *I* had done this alone and she had nothing to do with it and that same day had told several people that I MADE HER DO ALL OF THAT. I was in my room with my ear against the wall *while high* as I heard her snitch. I grabbed my wax out of my backpack and hid it under my bed. I end up walking out, told my parents “they were just rumors” and I convinced them because for a while I wore vary stoner-esque cloths. I told them I would be tasted *hoping they wouldn’t call my bluff* and three months later my parents had, out of left field, got me hair tested. I was high while they were doing it too because after all that time I thought I was in the clear. 

Back then I started growing my hair out to look more stoner like, and I started smoking about halfway into my hair being grown. The test came back negative for all drugs and either they they tested the wrong end of my hair, or my dad was lieing to see how much more trouble I could get myself into. B called me on a strangers number and said sorry, and I told her she is toxic and to not talk to me ever again. She sent an email with a more in-depth apology with a message saying “don’t respond and I will never talk to you or your family again.” 

This was 4 months ago now, and while at Dairy Queen on my dad’s birthday about 2 weeks ago, I stumbled upon B working there. My parents didn’t recognize her but B made the first move and said hi while I was trying to stay as far away in the back I could. My parents didn’t think I was mad at her because they thought that they were just rumors. I never told them what she had done. She is going to go to my school *NEXT YEAR* which is 2-3 months away. I don’t want to be around someone who made me an addict and snitched on me at her first chance. What do I do?"
14594,br89pr,radcoffee,I start a new job on Thursday and I came down with a horrible stomach flu today,"So basically I got a last minute interview I wasn’t expecting before I went on a 5 week trip and ended up getting a job at a jewelry store. I just came back on the weekend and caught a VERY bad stomach flu (can’t even keep water down without throwing up, and on top of other symptoms, i feel very weak.) and I’m supposed to start on Thursday. 

I’m not sure what to do, because calling out is a horrible first impression, but I’m bedridden and don’t want to get anyone else sick. What is the best way to call out? Should I call my boss today and let her know? I’m so scared that I’ll be fired for being sick."
18150,b8sc9l,ShutupnJive,Should I just quit my job?,"Bit of background. I am working in an industrial supply store and have been since I was 18. I am now 23 and really hating my job. Everything started out okay, but my boss has always had an...interesting dynamic with me. He always seems to be harder on me than other employees and treat me differently.

I am on minimum wage and have been since I started. Every mandatory minimum wage pay rise has been updated a minimum of 6 months after they should. I have asked for pay increases before but been shot down because 'you make too many mistakes, try again later"".

My boss is regularly short tempered with me and yells at or condescends me for mistakes he would laugh at if anyone else made. He recently implied that I was responsible for the company not making enough money this month, even though there is no way that could possibly be my fault, it was just a slow month, it happens every year.

I made a mistake once that cost us around $20 and he actually made me give him the cash, which is illegal here, because he didn't feel that he should have to cover. I would have offered to pay for it, have he not forced it out of me.

Today is the real kicker though, maybe because it is fresh. I tipped over a tub full of screws of different sizes and as I was sorting them out he came down and told me that I was a ""fucking idiot"" and that I need to take the screws home and sort them in my time, because he won't pay me to fix something so stupid. If he would do this with anyone in the store I wouldn't have a problem but he absolutely would only be this way with me.

The only reason I haven't already applied for more work is because I've been suffering some mental health issues lately, and am receiving therapy but don't feel that I'm ready right now for such a change in my life, but honestly I don't know how much more of this (illegal) bullshit I can handle."

6243,cwmywu,cheerupdontcry,How to avoid being lazy on a free day?,"Whenever I don’t have any commitments I find it extremely difficult to get out of bed. As in since there’s nothing planned my brain has no sense of urgency. This usually results in me sleeping until noon, eating and then back to laying in bed all day unti my parents come home from work. I would go out with my friends but usually they have Uni when I have my days off. 

I try to plan things such as going to gym or to the library to study but because these events aren’t compulsory I always put it off in the morning and go back to sleep. 

It always leads to me feeling guilty because I didn’t do anything for the whole day and results in me being unable to sleep that night because of oversleeping. 

This may just sound like a mild problem but I can just never seem overcome it. Ive talked to other people and they don’t seem to have this problem??? As in even if they don’t have plans for the day they still get out of bed at a reasonable time and don’t go back.

How do I change this lazy behaviour? Has anyone had this problem and overcome it??"

I'm a 30 year old male. Shortly after graduating university where I did my share of dating and fair share of hooking up and one night stands I started working. I had and still have lots of friends that I spend my time with and I was always just so tired after work that I lost the will to want to date or even go and find sex. Fast forward 6 years later and I haven't been on a date since my last year of university. 

I honestly don't know if I miss it or I don't. I don't know if I want it or I don't. On the one hand a lot of my friends have long time SOs, some are getting married etc. Some of them are good couples, others, not so much. Maybe I would want a girlfriend. I honestly don't know. It's a weird concept for me now because I haven't thought about it in so long.

On the other hand I think I lost my ""Mojo"" as it were. I honestly don't know the first thing about approaching women in ""real life"" since I never tried out of school. I don't know how all of this stuff works. It's honestly just a thing that other people seem to know how to do and I don't know how to start.

I will say I think sex would be nice. In the past several years I have only had sex once. I got back from 6 months in Australia beginning of July. I had sex with a legal prostitute while I was there and it was great. But that was easy. I just gave her money and I got sex. I didn't have to actually put any work in.

I guess my question is how do I figure out if this is really something I want in life? And how do I learn to go get it again?"

I laughed it off awkwardly, wished him a good night (like I would with any other customer), and helped the next customer because we were pretty busy since it was a Sunday evening.  But when I was leaving work later that night, I thought back to the encounter and it started making me anxious.  I didn't know this man and he was at least five years older than me, if not more.

20693,av1iyz,HGBB123,To tell or not to tell?,"My boyfriends sister ‘lauren’ is married with two children. Recently she has confessed to me about her husbands ‘aaron’ infidelities. It has led her into quite an anxious and depressive state but she has chosen to forgive him and move on and work on her marriage. Aaron has had multiple affairs and repeatedly Lauren has forgiven him, finding it easier to blame the other women than Aaron himself. 
Usually I stay way out of other relationships and rarely get involved. However recently Aaron has been sending me Snapchat’s which are highly inappropriate with regards to how I look and even asking me ‘how big are your boobs they look amazing’. He then goes on to mention how good I look in my Instagram photos etc. I have stated that this is highly inappropriate and the comments need to stop. However, he keeps trying to message me, admittedly they are fairly innocent messages ‘how was your holiday’ or ‘how was work’. But again he asks me directly over snapchat rather than in the group chat we all have together which involves my boyfriend and Lauren. 
I am now in a difficult position because I can either tell laura and potentially break up a marriage, alternatively she may blame me for his wrong doings which would make it difficult for my boyfriend to have a relationship with his sister. Or I don’t say anything and feel guilty for what he has been saying. 
I have communicated this with my boyfriend and initially he thought the best thing to do was to tell Lauren. But now he thinks keeping quiet is the best option as Lauren tends to blame others and forgive aaron anyway. 

So what do I do??? "
8838,cje84h,holly_golightly2,Arranged Marriages in India?,"Hi everyone, 

I recently learned that there are arrange marriages in India...

BACKSTORY: I met an Indian guy when I was in college and I fell for him hard (still falling). It's been years now that we've been friends. We were never a couple but it was more flirtatious and sexual (no committed relationship). I'm sure I wanted more but I didn't mind how things were going and I didn't want anything to change. Anyways, back to the point - he recently told me about arrange marriages and it hurt me. I stayed ""cool"" and listened to him talk about it. Now I can't help but feel hurt and feel as though I'm not good enough for him. 

I guess what I want to know is, is this a strict tradition? Because if so, I believe it is time for me to let go - the conversation made me realize that nothing was ever going to work out no matter the amount of hope I want to hold onto. 

*Didn't know where or who to go to so here I am... ANY insights would be appreciated. Thanks friends*"

8473,cl9g3e,Reeree360,Should I see my father and let him say goodbye to me before I leave for university?,"This may be a little long, and I apologize in advance. There is a TLDR at the bottom.


•Some background:

A week from today I move 4+ hours away from the small towns I have lived in my whole life and finally get to begin my life and live on my own. I’ve lived with my mom with my grandparents in their house for about three years now. Why have we lived with my grandparents?

Because we escaped my abusive father and it was the only place we had to go.

My father is incredibly narcissistic, diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and probably has more issues. For years my mother tried to help him, but he was always so controlling, paranoid, jealous, had gambling issues, alcohol dependence, and easily angered. Those things manifested into abuse over the years. First it was only manipulation with emotions, then emotional and mental abuse, and then it grew into physical abuse to my mother. I think it’s also important to note that my mother and father had troubles having children and miraculously I came into existence and I am their only child.

However, one particular night when the yelling and screaming from downstairs got too much that even my father’s father was called in (who inevitably took his son’s side no matter what) I decided to provoke my father enough by standing up to him and told me to “get out of my f**king house.” I had a bag packed already because my mom and I have left many times before and I bolted to my car down the lane. My father suddenly changed his mind and decided to chase after me but I made it to my car and floored it out of there. This gave my mom time to grab her bag and get into her car and leave too. We later lost the house because he gambled and spent all of my mother’s life savings away.

Long story short, we are now safe living at my grandparents, we are both happier than ever before, my mom is now working a better paying nursing job and saving up for a place of our own, and she is now with someone who treats her and loves her the way I’ve always wanted her to be (and has been more of a dad to me in 3 years than my birth father had been my whole life).

•The issue:

Obviously the title explains it, but over these years I have: had PTSD from dreams and random triggers of him, extreme anxiety and breakdowns whenever he showed up to my school events (which he never really did before we left, and if he did he always complained about it), avoidance of places I know he’d be out of fear, ignored all his texts and calls to me, and more. 

I have seen him a few times and briefly spoke at events and when my mother made me (back when she thought she might go back to him) but other than that; nothing.

I don’t want to say goodbye to him before I leave, but I’ll feel guilty if I don’t. He refuses to admit anything he has done to my mother and I over the years I thinks I just avoid him because my mother “manipulated” me. I just don’t know what to do. If he could just admit what he has done and has shown he has tried to get professional help and not just spew empty apologies, this could’ve been much easier for me to consider. But he hasn’t and probably never will... and it makes me so upset.

Now he wants to say goodbye before I leave for college. I feel he’s doing it just for his own gain and to feel good about himself. I feel so guilty about not wanting to or the possibility of not doing it at all, but I also start panicking when I think about what could happen if I do.

Any advice would be appreciated especially ways to cope and/or prepare for the result of either choice... Thank you in advanced. 

And If you read this entire post... Thank you for caring enough to make it this far. You’re a beautiful person.

TLDR;
After escaping years of abuse from my father and with me avoiding him out of fear during this time away from him, should I say goodbye to him before I leave for college?"

35843,7v2psn,LOL-4-DAYZ,Bestfriend is a super negative narcissist asshole.,"Sorry about this being really long.

 So i met my bestfriend about a year and a half ago when we were college freshman. It was both of ours first semester of college and we had a class together and sat near each other. We had a couple conversations and i thought he was really cool so I persisted to try and become friends. The more we started hanging out the more we both realized were twins and we can relate on literally everything. Throughout the first year we got very very close and up to this point were each others best and only really close friends. We also spend alot of time together, like every weekend, and know basically everything about each other. My problem is as the title states...hes kind of a piece of shit 90% of the time. The first year was so hard cause i was adjusting and getting to know him, he was (and still kind of is) a very mean/negative person. I think it was at its worst in the beginning because he had his walls up and we werent as close. Whenever he saw me up and happy or prospective of a good thing coming up, he kind of put me down or at the least not be happy for me at all, especially if hes angry or not doing as good in his life. During the beginning when we met he said alot of things that made me really insecure. It took more time to pass and for me to realize that his words arent shit. Now i know what everyone is probably thinking...why dont I just stop talking to him. Well as I said we can connect on a lot of different things, and putting aside the 99% of hes shit personality, the 1% is actually a pretty cool guy. At the end of the day were really close and have a blast hanging out most of the time. And theres nothing under the table about how we look at each other, weve actually joked around about our friendship being like the yin and yang chinese symbol because of how extermly positive, cheerful, and happy i am vs how negative, hateful, resentful, he is (im not even exaggerating, were literally as opposite in emotion as black and white). But lately ive been getting really annoyed by him, hes one of those people that are extermely extermely douchebag level prideful of themselves and sees no equal. For instance we got into our first argument a couple of months ago because he was insulting me as he usually does because we had different opinions about getting an MBA, i thought it was pointless and he thought the opposite. So what did he do? He unloaded everything in his mental toolbox to make me feel as stupid and little as possible. That wasnt the first time but i wanted it to be the last so i got up, called him out on being a dick and left. Stupid of me to think this idiot would apoligize within 24 hours for something so fucking stupid right? But no, hes right and i was wrong and he didnt care what that costed. We went a little over a week without talking(the longest ever since we met), but then after just getting over it and realizing that hes just a fucking moron who doesnt know how to control his mouth, i decided to just pretend like it never happened and went back to talking with him, plus i didnt want our friendship to end on something so stupid. And thats literally how we both went about it.... like it never happened. Ok whatever right? But then he brings it up when we were with other friends like this ""yea i would want a gf whos not so clingy, i need my space, for instance me and this guy *points to me* went a week without talking and then went back like nothing"". I just stayed quiet but i was so fucking angry!!!! We both know he was bullshitting thats how it was, but as i said hes extermely prideful and will never admit to doing something wrong. Now a days i can say its become alot better. I mostly think its because were extermly close now. However deep down i know i cant be too close with him. He talks about himself alot!!!! And i rarely talk about myself, mainly because i dont have as much of a inflated self image as him and also i know with somethings, hell put me down or make fun of me, ( very rarely hell be happy for me, and sometimes when he is, i feel like its not genuine). I find myself hiding alot of my personal life(for instance prospective job opportunites that im really excited about) from him, even though hes my bestfriend, is this normal and ok? Going back to his pridefulness, hes horrible at showing apprication. I think ive only heard 7 genuine ""thank you"" s from him since the day i met him. For example for his birthday i got him 2 of his absoulte favorite things ever and took him out to eat at a really expensive resturant(which is huge cause were both broke) and he barely showed any apprciation. Ive always had this feeling that as bestfriends you would want the best for each other and help each other as much as possible, i put in that feeling for him 100% but him only like 50%. I know for a fact he enjoys my company alot and has told me he loves me before and ive done the same lol. ( its a ""i love you bro"" type thing, nothing gay lmao. Plus we were on MDMA lol). I must say his improved alot over the past year but even when the bad things come up, i remember that were bros and try and be the bigger person.

Any opinions would be much appreciated!! "
7607,cpkpe4,Doctor_moose02,I’m spooked.,"Hey reddit. I’m a 16 year old guy living in Ohio currently. For the last 2-3 days I feel like I’m being watched. At the same time my dog has started acting extremely paranoid and barking a lot more than usual. I haven’t talked to my parents yet, but I’m home alone a lot and would like to stop being afraid to be. What are some things I can do to feel safer or take care of this problem without it becoming a big deal? Thanks!"
14075,bthitc,throwaway109u,"PTSD, OCD, makeup, and ”being attracted to people”","So this is a symptom that I struggle from. I love makeup and it’s a beautiful way for me to practice self love. It’s one of the things I’m able to do for myself, free from self loathing. Most of the time when I take my makeup off, I feel even more beautiful. It’s amazing. I just wanted to say that because I’m so thankful for that. 

But there’s also this thing I do, that I did well before I even received my diagnosis: staring at makeup palettes. I just turn on a YouTube video in the background and stare at my makeup palettes, sometimes for more than an hour. It’s just so satisfying for me to see that some shadows are more used up than others. I’m just there alone, hunched over in my room in the dark, feeling nothing but dread and terror, unable to stop staring at makeup. And then ofc it’s time to binge to numb the pain. 

All of my most troubling OCD symptoms that I have are ones that I’ve almost never seen anyone ever talk about, and it’s so fucking isolating. I don’t even even believe that I have OCD in my heart of hearts, even though I have received a diagnosis. It just hasn’t gotten into my head. I don’t wash my hands over and over or count, but I am very careful where I step and I try to even put things a lot, but those symptoms are honestly nothing compared to the dread I feel from the ones that I’ve never come across anyone else having. 

I feel so low about this, and I’m frustrated, because one of the few things that I was able to have in my life that wasn’t polluted by mental illness, makeup, has become a stumbling block, just like everything else. 

Most of the things that I love to do involve some sort of OCD triggers. Sometimes the entire thing that I love is a trigger. I really truly don’t know how to enjoy things anymore. 

My therapist also told me straight up that being attracted to someone is a trigger for me. I can’t stop seeing boys in my dreams and the thoughts of boys distract everything I do. I don’t want to think of them a lot of the time, but then the thoughts persist and I become addicted to the high of fantasizing about them. Before I know it, all I can think about is the cute boy who works at CVS who is clearly interested in me too. This definitely also has to do with my sexual abuse-related PTSD. I can’t even enjoy being attracted to a boy because my PTSD kicks in and the PTSD thoughts persist with the repetition of OCD and before you know it I am looking at some random dude like he’s a monster. The guy at CVS is tall and big and strong and I don’t care if he wants to be nice to me. In my head all he wants to do is fuck me and hurt me and I often see images of these boys in my head hurting me. 

Poor guy doesn’t even have a shot. Even if he tried to reach out gently, I’d be too afraid to hold his hand. I’m so frustrated, because I am so traumatized that I can’t even hold a boy’s hand. I’m 19 years old and I’ve never kissed a boy, largely because my trauma has held me back from even getting to know a boy who I have feelings for. If I had a dime for every time I sabotaged a situation where I had chemistry with someone out of fear, I’d be able to pay my fucking student loan debt off. And all of this shit could’ve been stopped if my parents had just decided to stand up for me when I was 12 years old and told them that this boy wouldn’t stop touching me, even when I told him to stop. 

I love watching people my age being so comfortable with themselves in relationships, unafraid to let someone in. I’m so jealous, because they have no reason to have their guard up like mine. 

How the fuck is “being attracted to someone” triggering???? Like what the fuck even is that?!?! 

I have no idea how I’ll ever be able to get close to someone. To be honest, I don’t think my therapist knows either, and I’m so scared.

Doesn’t anyone have any advice on what to do in this situation, whether it be regarding, treatment, coping mechanisms, or anything else you can think of? I’m just looking to get better."

My parents have always been picky about what things I buy with my money. I’m scared that they will get mad at me for buying this server PC as Last year they bought me an iMac core 2 duo from 2007 for school. They might get mad at me for buying this iMac g4 since I already have an iMac. They never really liked my interest in video making so this might really tick them off.

21533,aradul,kaylitacerezita,i’m in love with my boyfriends ex,"okay this is long but i am torn and don’t know what to do (and pretty interesting story i promise). I am an 18 yo female and I identify as bisexual, I have only been with males but I know i have a sexual attraction towards girls. 

When I was 15 and a sophomore I went to an all girls school and my last period I had art class that was mixed with all the grades. The girl directly across the table from me was a senior and since the first day of class there was something that gravitated me towards her. she had this long wavy hair, porcelain doll skin, perfectly thick eyebrows, bubbly personality, petite, made honor roll, and so on. she was everything that i wasn’t and what i wanted to be. over the school year i wouldn’t say we became close but we did talk an awful lot to each other about our lives and interests and problems and whatever. 

the last 3 months of the school years she had gotten a boyfriend and would talk about him but i didn’t take much notice of him. he followed me on instagram and i followed back but that was that. it wasn’t until that summer she graduated that i had realized i had a crush on her, maybe even was in love with her in the most innocent way possible. i was only 15 and she was 18 and i had never had feelings like that about a girl until her. when she graduated that was the last time i saw her or even spoke to her but we still had each other on all social media.

fast forward 2 summers later and my boyfriend of a lengthy time had just broken up with me. i was going to start college and i wanted to meet people. i had gotten tinder and a couple days later while i was on it i saw him. the girl i had a crush on from sophomore year, it was her boyfriend. i haven’t told him this, yes i did think he was attractive, but i had swiped right on him because i thought they were still together and i wanted to possibly catch him cheating. we matched and he had messaged me the next night. we had messaged for a week before we met and even then it wasn’t much flirting, just two people getting to know each other. when we met we had gone on a “date” to get sushi and he didn’t bring her up so i just didn’t say anything to him or her. he said he liked talking to me and he wanted to hang out again so we did. on the second so called date he had told me about how a month prior he broke up with his ex and that he had cheated on her over message, snapchat, and in person with a dozen other girls and he had just wanted to “be real” with me from the beginning because he liked me. 

also the second time when we hung out (when he had told me about cheating) i had realized that i was falling for him. i truly thought he was charming, cute, intriguing, and funny. we ending up hanging out more and on the 6th date i kissed him. at this point she had found out somehow about us and blocked me on every social media, i was secretly heart broken because i knew she hated me and i just wanted to tell her everything. but soon after we had started a sexual relationship and then started dating a month and a half later. 

we have been together for half a year now and i love him with all the love that i have. we spend a generous amount of time together and we would do anything for each other and i consider him my best friend. but we do fight. sometimes being the insecure girl i am, i start arguments about how i think he will cheat on me because he’s done it before (i always thought if he would do it to her even though she’s so perfect why would he do it to me). 

but he always had negative things to say about her, never once have i heard him say something nice. he would give dumb excuses to how she was annoying because she wouldn’t have much sex with him, she was a vegan so she wouldn’t let him eat meat, he found her boring because they wouldn’t go out much, etc. but secretly i wanted to know more and more. i didn’t think she was annoying so those things i thought she was perfect the way she was. a few weeks ago when we were cleaning his room together i had found an envelope of homemade cards she would give him from vday, christmas, birthdays, and i got a lump in my throat and quickly put them back away where we wouldnt see them on purpose. i wasn’t jealous of her but i had realized i was jealous of him. he didn’t deserve any of those, i should have been the one to get those cards and letters. 

since then it’s been eating me alive that i’m still in love with her. lately i’ve been thinking about how he took advantage of this girl that i wanted to give the world to.

if you have made it reading all this way, thank you. but my question for advice is this. the question is not should i tell him, but should i feel guilty for still liking her? even though my intention was different at the beginning i ending up falling in love with him, but i’ll always have her in the back of my mind. 

[and if for some reason she ends up finding this: please know from the bottom of my heart, i am so sorry and i think about you everyday and i hope you are doing okay, w.]

                                                                  -l"

Now, I’m bisexual in theory, however I’ve never been with a guy and my attraction towards girls is definitely stronger. I have a lot of mixed feelings about this.

I used to work at a ""corporate"" store chain and loved it. Sure I didn't get many hours but I was the best paid one on the team and loved my job. I loved the early short hours and the work itself. I got along well with my coworkers who shared the same sarcastic sense of humor. Only problem was there was no sort of health/dental benefits.

Last year I took a new job at the hippy grocery store in town since they offered full time hours and health/dental. I was miserable. Customers are meaner, it feels like coworkers are gossiping behind my back about me. We aren't allowed to say anything that criticizes the store even if it is a simple suggestion about how to make our jobs easier. Someone in a different department walked out because he was written up for asking about switching days off. I don't fit well here. 

The only reason I'm staying is the health/dental and higher pay but it's mentally destroying me. I also don't want others to think I'm bailing because this is the first full time job I've had in a while and can't handle it. I already contacted my old manager and would hire me back in a heartbeat.

15472,bms9et,Tnay4eva,I caught my mom cheating on my dad...,"This happened 23 years ago, I was 13. School let out early due to a power outage and I lived within walking distance so I just walked home. Came around the corner and saw a strange car parked in front of my house. I immediately thought, ""what if mom's cheating on dad?"", no idea why that's where my brain took me. 
I walked in the front door and my glasses started fogging up from the heat inside but I could see there was no one around. I called out for my mom and got no reply. I walked into the kitchen and there she was, up on the counter, fucking my dad's best friend. 
I yelled, ""MOM!?!?!"" and immediately ran outside. Dude found me and proceeded to tell me that he couldn't help it, my mom was too tempting. What. The. Fuck.
Mom kept telling me not to tell dad and that it was a mistake. She tried bribing me with going to rent movies at the video store and I reluctantly agreed. 
I don't remember picking out movies, the drive back home, or what we had for dinner. All I remember is when we all sat down to watch one of the movies, my mom sat on the couch right next to dad and was cuddling him in a way that I had never seen before. Like, super affectionate and OTT. 
I was disgusted. I had to get out of there so I went to a friend's house and just stared at her t.v. without really watching. I was still stunned and couldn't process what the hell I had just seen. 
They're still married and I still haven't told my dad. He loves my mom so much, I don't want to hurt him. 

*Flash forward*
I have a son who is 13 and this is now affecting me in a completely different way. I couldn't imagine ever heaving such a tremendous weight onto my child's shoulders. Looking at it from this perspective makes me feel so sorry for my 13 y/o self and makes me not want to speak to my mom. I think about this a few times a week, I don't try to, it just pops in my head. It's not something I've been able to forget. It's been in my mind for 23 years and mom acts like nothing ever happened. I'm carrying her burden and she's just fine.
I guess I would like to know how others would feel were they in my shoes. I'm opting out of mothers day celebrations this year because of my feelings. Am I being a dick?? A baby?? I wanna forget this, but I don't think I ever will. Any advice you'd like to share??"
5557,d0nlb5,Blue-Genes560,I'm having a serious anxiety issue which started with someone recording my tourettes.,"2 years ago I was in highschool. I have tourettes. Technically, it's actually called motor tic disorder. I make movements, but no vocal noises. 

I'm not technically diagnosed with it, but it's obvious I have it and people in my past have pointed it out. I'll refer to it as tourettes through all this to make it easier. 

I can pretty much control my tourettes with a few issues here and there. I generally let it all out when I'm home in my bedroom. 

This one kid in one of my classes noticed my tourettes. One day it was close to exams and I got a little bit of anxiety. It was just general anxiety you get when exams or something important comes up. 

During this one lesson close to exams my tourettes got bad and he and my teacher noticed. I knew that kid was staring at me, but he  had no idea that I could see him. 

He decided to start recording me and even recoded my face. I just passed it off and didn't think twice about it. 

One year later that memory came back to me after my first year university exams. 

It fucking broke me. It really did. I absolutely lost my mind. I was screaming in my mind. I was so stressed that I felt like I always had a fever, I could only sleep for about an hour a day and I thought about that tourettes event every second of every day. 

I couldn't even watch TV or video games to distract me. I kept on seeing that event on the screen. 

I was completely losing my mind that I was getting panic attacks which made me feeling like I was having a heart attack. I thought I was going to go completely insane. 

I couldn't take it anymore so I went to my doctor. I didn't tell him about the anxiety, but I told him about my insomnia who prescribed me some sleeping pills. 

They worked, but the anxiety was still there and wouldn't go away. 

I eventually went back to the doctor's who I told about my anxiety. He put me on medication and sent me to a psychologist. I didn't tell him why I had anxiety, but he was shocked about what I said. About how I kept on thinking about the event every second of every day. 

I've been through so many medications, but they ultimately leave bad side effects. 

The psychological support didn't help me either.  

The problem is that my anxiety picks up a bad thought and I keep ruminating on it. Additionally, my tourettes are much worse because of it. 

I don't really want to go into it, but I've done a lot of stupid stuff because the anxiety would make me think of something bad happening to me and then I would act upon it which would ultimately be a bad decision. This would fuel the anxiety even more. 

It's nothing illegal, but it's damaged relationships and I get anxious thinking it can ruin my professional life when I enter the workforce. 

For example, my sister constantly goes on Instagram and YouTube on her phone looking at memes and videos. She's always sitting there in the living room and laughing. 

One day, my anxiety was so bad as I was constantly thinking of that tourettes episode when I was recorded. I thought my sister saw the video of me as she was laughing. I was losing it and started to think she saw the video of me. I started shouting at her asking her what she's laughing at. I almost said to her ""Have you seen a video of me?"". 

It's not just thoughts about the video. The anxiety disorder started triggering other issues in me such as thinking that people are always looking at me, laughing at me and so on. 

There are other situation that I desperately want to tell you all about, but I just can't. I don't have the courage to do so. They're stupid things that I've done that have ruined relationships with friends. I've spoken about them on Reddit before and people called me a creep, weirdo and so on, but I never mentioned the anxiety, tourettes or being recorded. That was simply to get a gauge on what people thought about what I did as they assumed I was normal and mentally okay. 

They're not all about the video, but the anxiety had caused me to become anxious and suspicious of other people. It's caused me to become obsessed with people and their actions. 

I was never like this. Nothing that anybody did bothered me, but now it feels like I need to keep a careful eye on everyone like they're all out to get me. 

I've recently been back on Facebook because I was so lonely this year. I had nobody to talk to. It was like I was under sensory deprivation. I go so desperate that made a Facebook account and added my old friends. 

I've recently found out that one of my close friends back at school who I'm sure I at least sent a friend request to has blocked me. I have no idea why and I'm now going crazy as to why. I haven't said a word to him since I've been on Facebook and he was a really go friend of mine back in school. He definitely would have remember me. I'm sure of it. 

Has he seen that video of me? Has he seen me do other stupid things with my anxiety? I don't know. I'm going crazy thinking about it. 

I've also been habitually checking the internet for that video. I constantly check Facebook top posts, YouTube trending and so on. I check it everyday hoping that I don't see that video, but I sometimes hope I do see that video so I can finally be put out of my misery. 

As mentioned, my tourettes have been getting worse. I'm part of a tennis club that I joined a few months ago. I'm a very sporty person, particularly endurance sports. 

When I picked up tennis I got really good at it very fast. My coaches who are the club leaders started giving me extra training and even started asking me all these questions about my availability and so on. It's completely obvious that they're trying to get me on the club team so that we/ I can compete with other clubs. 

I went to tennis practice 3 times a week. I eventually stopped because some of the members noticed that there was obviously something wrong with me. It's been about 2 months since I've been. I didn't tell any of the members as to why I haven't been. I just completely stopped and never contacted them. 

I went to practice in the morning by myself 2 days ago because I really missed playing. I was practicing serves. Nobody was there, but a member was walking past and started talking to me asking where I've been. She seemed really concerned and I just lied to her. 

I've got practice tomorrow and I don't know if I should go. 

This is becoming a huge issue in my life. I actually didn't go to university this academic year because my anxiety had become so bad. 

My anxiety fuels my tourettes which in return fuels my anxiety. It's just a cycle. 

Recently, I haven't been going out either. I've just stayed in the house. I only go to the gym at night and people have started noticing things about me there. 

I'm so scared that they're going to record me. 

I don't even want to go to the gym anymore. My new plan is to do home workouts and just go running at 03.00 AM as I live in a quite area so nobody will see me. 

It's also hard to go meet people or date . I just get scared when a lady smiles at me because I keep thinking they saw that video and they're actually laughing at me. 

I've had girls that have clearly shown interest in my such as grabbing my forearm or stroking their hair and smiling as they look into my eyes when they're sitting opposite me on a table, but I just get scared and go off. I never used to be like this. 

I'm so scared to go out. I keep thinking everyone has seen me on the internet and I keep thinking people are going to record me once they seem my tourettes. 

I don't know what to do anymore. My doctors can't help me and my psychologist can't help me either. 

I keep thinking someone is going to record me. Everybody has a camera on them these days and everybody uses social media. Somebody is going to see me. 

I'm completely losing it. I feel like I'm going to go  permanently insane. 

**Can somebody please help me**?"

I'm about to turn 25 at the start if the year which is causing quite a bit of introspection.

Summary of my background professionally.
No degree- attended a private medical college in ohio for their accelerated physicians assistant program but dropped out due to family issues and lack of money. Continued to work at the hospital I worked at during school.

Two years as a sales person for a logistics company
Pay 35k 
Two years in insurance as a claims adjuster 
40k
Current occupation

Now a phone trader for a discount brokerage firm 47-55k 
My job now is horrendous the majority of it is explaining how securities work to the wealthy elderly and the wealthy ignorant. This is of course in relation to their brokerage retirement/non retirement accounts. As well as conducting trades for them and making sure they don't do anything too stupid. My lack of a degree I feel is holding me back professionally and preventing me from moving on to roles that will allow me to expand my skill sets and learn more. 

Home situation
Married with a one year old now, my wife and I live on my income solely we live beneath our means and were even able to purchase a home this year by suffering and making sure we were disciplined in our spending. Despite all of this I am not happy professionally and I want to provide a better long term life for my wife and son. My goal salary wise is make 75 in the next year or two, but I also want to do something that helps me make a positive impact. I'm considering  going back to school for medicine possibly and just taking student loans on the chin. However I know this will be difficult with a home to maintain and a family to support. I feel so lost and trapped in a job that I loathe but cornered there with the pressure of making sure I can feed my family. Any help or life planning advice is appreciated in advance. "
13645,bvcg8p,flazeduhh,My guy friend won't leave me alone,"So I have a guy friend from my high school (we're all 17) who really likes me in a non-romantic way. He always tells me that I am the most valuable person for him and always tries to get my attention, but he's kinda weird as well, like kind of immature and goofy in an annoying way. Im just really sick of him smothering me.

So the problem is, my crush is close friends with this guy, and we usually hang up as a group of 3, since my crush probably has no idea i like him ""that"" way. Sometimes I just want some alone time on discord with my crush but he's always there and calling me to play stuff with them. And when i do go on discord to talk with them, I try to ignore him in the kindest way possible but he just doesn't seem to let go and take the hint.

Not that I hate him, we actually helped each other a lot in the past, but we were pretty distanced from each other back then. Now I'm also in the same class with him and there is no escape, it seems. 

So, how do I stop him from smothering me and ""liking me too much"" if you will, without being a rude b\*tch? I feel like if I distance myself from him, I might get some more alone time with my crush, im kind of desperate for that :/"

I went on his phone to turn his alarm of in case it woke up the baby, I saw a message from his friend which had my name, it ended up being nothing but I scrolled down on his messages (I know that's bad) and found all these different girls that he had clearly been sleeping with during the first year of our relationship (the worst part was some of them seem to genuinely believe they were in a relationshio and in love with him) from what I can see this all stopped once I got pregnant but that doesn't excuse the entire year we were together and he was fucking around disrespecting me, also doesn't mean he's not still doing it just means there's no evidence. I'm heartbroken coz honestly if you knew this guy he is the last person in the world you would ever suspect of cheating which is why I had no idea. 
I don't know what to do I moved city's for him away from all my family and friends so we could have our baby and start a family together. It's actually fucking humiliating and I'm dreading having the tell people what he's done!
I so badly want our little girl to have a mummy and a daddy who love and respect each other and I don't want to leave because of her but I also want to kill him. Even if it stopped once I got pregnant he still did it and I don't know if will ever trust him again

444,drnqd5,CoolPepCat,"Please help, my english teacher made me cry and I'm not sure what to do","To begin- I'm not neurotypical, I.E, I have a few mental disorders, namely Depression, Anxiety, and Autism, obviously, this plays a lot into it.

It's my first year of college and it's overall been going great, my professors are all really nice and helpful, they all seem to care a great deal about both their students and what they do.

My english teacher isn't a professor, she's a student teacher- which is important, but I went into her class with no judgement.

And the last detail is that I wear headphones to school a lot, most of the time it's white noise or music, but I always have it on the second lowest setting, and i always have one headphone off to the side, so my hearing is just fine.

Everything started out just fine, she told us to write proposals for our essay, so I did. After a little bit, she said people were going to start coming up to show her the proposals. She said, ""Okay, first row!"", but from what I saw, no one really stood, so I stayed sitting down. She proceeded to call them up one by one, and this is where it gets really stupidly specific for me.

She said things like, ""Okay, student A, come up and show me your proposal"" or ""Student B, what are you writing about?"". She got to me and stared at me, she just said, ""CoolPepCat."" and stared at me.

I got scared, like she was mad at me or something, I should have inferred that I should have gone up there to show her my proposal, but she hadn't said ""CoolPepCat, come up and show me your proposal,"" she just said my name and stared at me. 

I started to get scared, and stuttered, asking ""Yeah?""

She replied with ""Can you hear?"" referring to my headphones

Of course I can, so I reply ""Yeah""

She says ""So why didn't you come up when I called your name?""

And I tried to explain, but I was panicking, I started to stutter more while trying to get the words out, after a few seconds-

She rolled her eyes, sighed, and said ""Second row. I guess you can tell me yours after class"". She said it in front of the entire class, and I started to panic and pick at me skin and breathe hard- I was embarrassed and afraid.

After class, she looked at me- I was still panicking and not sure what to do, she said- ""Can you hear?"" again, I said ""Yes""

She said, ""Why aren't you talking to me?""

So I tried to explain to her, I'm an easy crier so it was a little...very tough. I explained that I don't do well with those kinds of cues, but more importantly, I felt like she made me feel like an idiot, and embarrassed me in front of the entire class.

The crux of my side of the argument was, ""I understand that I might not be easy to work with, but I felt like you were treating me badly, and it made me scared and upset""

Her side of the argument was that I should have gotten the cue to stand up, which honestly made me feel even stupider, because I know I should have gotten it, and I'm embarrassed with myself that I didn't get that cue, so I kept trying to explain my reasoning.

Eventually, I managed to get out that I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do because I was looking at what the other kids were doing.

She told me that I should have just told her that, I guess I should have but I did try to explain myself earlier.

Anyways, basically, I'm not sure what to do, I left the class with tears on my face and her staring at me like I was 100% garbage. I only have a month and a half left in the class, so dropping isn't an option, the only ideas I have in my mind ATM are to email the department head, or just shut up and hope she spares my grade.

What should I do?"
24406,9899e5,dickwithwings,"My roommate might be hurting my dog when I'm not home, I don't know what to do.","I'm posting this here because I literally don't know where else to turn. Tonight is the second time I've come home to find my smallest dog with bloodshot-looking eyes, shit stuck to his fur and looking like he'd been wandering in the wilderness or something. I leave him in my bedroom to keep him separated from my other dog (they don't fight, but I like to err on  the side of caution) and while I was at work for eight hours the only person who would have had access to him was my roommate of 8 months. 

The first time this happened, I took my dog to the emergency vet because he's prone to seizures and I thought maybe his red eyes and weird disposition were due to that. The vet found nothing wrong, and basically just said 'sure, maybe it was a seizure' and sent us on our way. After this I installed a pet camera in my room to be able to watch him when I'm at work and see if it happened again. My roommate is the kind of super friendly, happy kind of person who wouldn't harm a fly, has kids he's great with, so even though in my paranoid mind it occurred to me, I didn't want to even think that he would hurt my dog for any reason. 

The part that unsettles me the most is that the pet camera, which I've left turned on for the past month, AND I had checked it last at about 7:30pm today (I got home at a little past 11pm) was switched off. There were no motion/sound alerts on my phone app at all for today, let alone showing that my roommate would have turned it off. It's possible he could have turned off the router and therefore left the camera unable to alert me if he did turn it off. But all I really know is I didn't switch it to the off position, and it's not like my dogs could have. 

My dog was a mess, there was shit on the floor, even a few spots on the window blinds and the walls?? One was like five-six feet higher than my dog, how could he have possibly done this alone? I woke my roommate up when i got home to ask him if he'd been in my room or heard anything strange, and he said no, seemed bewildered by the mess in my room. My dog started shaking when he saw my roommate, immediately pawing at me to pick him up. He was scared of him the last time this happened, even though he loved him before that day. He was slowly warming up to him again since then, and it'd been awhile since he started shaking at the sight of him.

I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to ask, or start throwing accusations. My roommate doesn't seem like the kind of person that would hurt an animal, but I've experienced firsthand people capable of horrible things. If he did hurt my dog, I wouldn't even be able to kick him out for financial reasons. I can't pay my rent alone, and I don't really know people where I live. I feel so helpless, if anyone can suggest anything I can do at this point, I'd be really grateful. "
12869,bz749g,KyoruYuchi,"I'm getting a job at a pizza place and apparently after just a month I can try to become a manager there. I'm moving out soon and I'd like to take on the opportunity to be a manager and it would help me financially to be able to live with my roommates. Problem is, is that I'm frightened.","So here is the whole background story:

I moved out once when I was 16 but i didn't really pay rent just for household items and basic necessities. So it was nothing on my end. I moved back home and I've been living here ever since.

I'm now 18 turning 19 soon and I've had the worst luck with jobs because I always choose places with around 50-70 employees and it has always been drama filled and personally being around a lot of people constantly always made me feel uncomfortable. 

Now that I'm graduated I got the opportunity to live with my old roommate from when I was 16 in their new place with 2 other roommates. 

So i went job hunting nearby since I don't have a car at the moment and It would save me a lot of time stressing out about going home and doing homework for college this fall.

I found a pizza place that was willing to hire me on the spot and I start in a couple of days. When they introduced me to how everything works the GM said that he's also looking for managers so after my 30 day probation if I'm interested he would be willing to consider it. It made me feel super excited.

Why am i scared and filled with anxiety about all of this?:
I've always had bad luck with jobs and doubted I would ever be promoted to a higher position. When i heard this opportunity it made me excited but I'm scared because I've never had a lot of responsibility thrown onto me as much as that. 
With paying bills, going to college and possibly becoming a manager at some point it all sounds stressful and frightening. 

I also plan on going to community college and I don't think I can handle full time as I would be doing part time so I can work and pay the bills.

So i need advice:
-Is doing part time classes okay? My family doesn't see it as a good idea but I think its a pathway that would personally suit me and my situation

-Should I take that opportunity to become a manager? It wouldn't be something I would do forever if anything I want to do something involving video editing and what I actually love doing. (So growing it on the side while I work)

-is it really a bad thing to move out with roommates at the age of 18? Others keep telling me to go for it and others say it's a bad idea, but the one's who keep telling me it's a bad idea are usually the ones who have had untrustworthy roommates and the roommates I have are trustworthy, financially stable and know how to finance (ive also known them for a long time and they're in their mid 20s)

-And well from what you have read what do you think is making me so hesitant because I barely know myself...?"

To start, I'm a 24 year old female that works in customer service. I feel like my coworkers look at me like I am a joke. I definitely don't feel respected as a person (I am decent at my job, so I do not think it's due to my performance.) I wish I did not have to interact with them at all, but they all really push to interact with me constantly... and not in a nice, I-want-to-get-to-know-you way. In the way when someone can sniff out the insecurity in another person and jumps to attack it. For example, an older girl that I work with snickers at and sneers at me when she sees me. And EVERYONE has some stupid shit to say when walking past me. Everyone asks me ""What's wrong? You ok?"" in the kind of in the way where you just want to point out someone quiet who looks like they are hurting inside. I wish someone was *genuinely* interested in how I am, if they are going to ask that. I wish I was more intimidating. Leave me alone, please.

I hate almost every person I come across. Even strangers. I can't help but think that I am the exact type of person that shoots up a public establishment, minus the violence and gun nuttiness. I have that burning anger and pure hatred for random people I have had minimal interaction with. I think most people are a waste of life. It upsets me that I feel this way. I never wanted to be this way... I would much rather be the radiating, vibrant girl that makes people smile and loves interaction. 

How do I overcome this? How do I stop hating people? How do I get people to respect me? Do I need to love myself more? Is this my depression talking? What the hell is wrong with me?"

2919,dejsln,astralglitter,I tried restarting my life. Do I need to leave again?,"TLDR; Since I moved from my home state in April, my family and I have been rolling with the heavy punches and I'm completely insecure about my life right now.

We moved 1500 miles across the country for my fiancees job in March 2019. It's our first time living without roommates and our relationship is fine but everything around us is trying to take us down. We're hard working, competent and don't want anything but the best for everyone we meet. 

I started a new job for the city that ended up being nothing as described and while I was away working, my dog was so loud in our apartment that he almost got us kicked out. I had to leave that job and find something part time - which took months. 

Come August, my fiancee gets laid off from the job that moved us out here and we both start new jobs. I finally find the perfect part time job and he loses almost $10 an hour doing what he does now. 

Presently, that part time job I got laid me off on Friday. I was with a staff agency and filling a position as a teller at a bank - not what I went to school for but I wanted a change of pace anyway. I made the commitment to stick it out 6 months then reevaluate - which was asked of me. On Friday, somehow $100 went missing and I have no clue how because I'm diligent and know that my family depends on this job. 

Not only do I get accused of stealing once at work, but again this morning by the staff agency in a 'feedback call'. Y'know, if I was going to steal - I would have made it worth it with the $15k in my drawer. Appalling! $100 isn't worth losing my job. 

Also, working with strictly women who are married and have children, I mentioned that I wished the same for my family once we get stable. Someone took this as ""getting married then leaving the company"" wtf. That's exactly what came from the gal during my ""feedback call"". Needless to say, I wouldn't want to be working with such women that preach faith and religion but make up false accusations and possibly steal to get someone out. 

So now here I am in the expensive apartment that we can barely afford, one car payment and all my credit cards going into collections then debating bankruptcy. I couldn't even afford more than my car and utility bills ($600 for the lease, insurance, utilities) when I was with the bank. Thank god my fiancee breaks his back for us :(

I have an interview for a school assistant director (which my schooling is in ECE) and I am praying I can get back into feeling normal again doing what I love. 

But I have this undying curiosity to know if leaving my home state was the best idea. We have been dealing with blow after blow. We just can't get ahead and it's suffocating us."
3768,d9zpp6,SatcasticPsyientist,How do I get over feeling awkward about my race?,"My mom is the lighter skinned hispanic. My grandmother immigrated to America when she was 13 from Spain (long story, she arrived years after her parents came over). Her parents forbad anything that didn’t fit the American mold (no Spanish speaking) so she continued this when she had kids. My grandfather was Spanish/Irish. While my grandmother and cousins are dark, my mom married a white dude (he cheated and left when I was 4 so he doesn’t get the name dad) so my siblings and I are light. It’s weird because throughout my life I’ve had my white friends constantly ask me what I am because they can tell I’m “not quite white”. But my Hispanic friends tell me since I don’t speak Spanish I’m not really Hispanic. It bothers me because I don’t really feel like I belong in either culture. It also sucks because my white friends, including my HUSBAND, think they can make racial jokes at me.
I don’t know why but they don’t do this with our darker skinned friends. Am I wrong to feel this way? I know race shouldn’t matter but it gets weird when I talk to people about our family dynamics. Also, why do all my white friends act horrified when I laugh about recounting childhood beatings? My grandma could throw a slipper like fucking Tom Brady."

12992,byl13m,livefree62,Should I[25F] go on one more date with this guy [32M] or break it off?,"I’ve been on 3 dates with a really nice guy. We met at bars twice and the third time I went to his apartment do have dinner and watch a movie.

The problem is- I keep waiting for the butterflies to show up and they never do. We have very deep intellectual conversations and we’re both entrepreneurs so we have the same work ethic as well. 

However I think his work ethic is more extreme than mine- he says he doesn’t believe in relaxing and that sleeping is a “waste of time”. 

Last night we kissed and to put it plainly - it was bad. Super awkward, messy.. just not a good kiss at all.

Today we have plans to meet up again but I’m wondering if I should just break it off. If I haven’t felt butterflies at this point, they won’t show up right?

The other part of me is saying - stop, you break it off with people too soon and you never get to know the real them. You’re going to end up dying alone if you keep doing this.

Should I see him today and give it another shot or tell him there isn’t really any chemistry and break it off?"
27398,8s8vlm,Rainyrain90,Hoping for an advice with my final driving exam!,"Hello Reddit, i don't know what else to put in my head or do but i tried pretty much everything and I'm here for ideas or at least a bit of motivation. I'm not even sure its called ""anxiety"" at this point but this is what I'm going thru.

I am a 27 years old male without a driving license. I started doing my driving exams when i was 22. The exams here work like this. U pick one of the instructors that will teach u to drive, and u drive only with him and his car with a sign Driving School, not with any parents like i see its in US (I think). Once u have enough hours with the said instructor u have the final drive, where one of the people from the commision sits at the back seat with your instructor, evaluates your 45min drive and tells u if u passed or not.

I had fun driving and learning, and i always hopped in the car with excitement, at least until i got to my first final exam. I failed it, i don't remember exactly why, but it was something minor and when u only have 20h or so the commission wont let u thru easy. (Might i add that i felt tension everytime as soon as the guy from the commision sat in the car.)

Second time , again i failed somehow, also was something minor and i haven't put anyone in danger. That's when my anxiety came into its full swing. I knew if i failed the third time that i will have to go write the test again which u have to pay for and the questions are quite misleading, and it was basically my last try before i would kinda have to ""start over"" and i was and am short on money. And as it happened i drove thru a Stop sign. I failed completely understandably. After the second time i even tried popping an anxiety pill, tried to meditate, self hypnosis and by the gods it didnt work...I actualy think it made it all worse since i was working and thinking so much about it.

5 years have passed, and almost everyday i had the thought of me being an almost middle aged male without a license and a car, being dependant on buses and other people, just made/makes me feel less of a man and a loser. Still does.

So now i started doing my driving again and tommorow i have my first final exam after all these years and I'm terrified of the thought of history repeating itself.

I tend to overthink stuff a lot, i know how to drive, i really believe that I'm gonna drive safe, fine and without any tension when i will be driving alone, but just driving in that car marked with ""driving school"" kinda puts me down and i feel less than others on the road in it, i feel like others keep driving like right behind me on purpose and stuff like that, it just throws me off. Also the grumpy faces from the commission people don't help.

I know there are people with a lot bigger problems, but this is taking a toll on me for so many years now,its always somewhere in the back of my mind and i just want to be free already, so guys if u have any tips or anything i will gladly take them!

12234,c2hv0x,kellythebarber,Is ghosting someone ever OK?,"I own a vacation property that I rent out seasonally on a home sharing site. I hired a housekeeper four years ago and she has been the only one to work for me since. She was the one to approach me. Her work has been excellent and I was happy to help her get her business launched. I passed her name along to several people and I watched her business grow. She asked me to write her a review but I encouraged her business by using word of mouth. 

Last year, her work got a little sloppy and she left my door unlocked when she left. I told her about it and she apologized. She told me that I did not have to pay for her service that week. I thought that was ridiculous since she still did the work. I paid her anyway and put a sensor on the door so I would know if it was locked. 

When the season started this year, she did not start work for me as she always had in the past. When I attempted to contact her she never responded to me. I ended up having to hire someone else but it was a scramble since I had no warning. She could have told me last fall that she was not coming back or responded to me at the beginning of this season. I promoted her business to the point that she was too busy for me. I know she is still in business due to social media. I would like to write that review for her now and let others know that she does excellent work but be prepared to get ghosted. I didnt have a back up plan and I was not prepared to do the work myself since I have a full time job. 

TL;DR My long time housekeeper quit without notice and left me in a bind. Should I let others know to warn them?"

I recently watched the “Leaving Neverland” documentary and that really was even more of a trigger. As a child I was molested by my older brother, for years.  To make the situation worse my mother knew it was happening, walked in while it was happening and did absolutely nothing.  The only thing she did do was give me a look of disgust and shut the door.  The abuse went on from ages 5-11.  During my teenage years and early 20’s I was an absolute mess and dealt with horrible mental issues all the while my mom pretending like she had no idea why I may be suffering.  I  beyond sad that my childhood was taken from me and beyond.  I am sad for myself as a little girl, that I had no one to protect me and that my mother could be so cruel and cold.  My dilemma now, is I still feel she benefits and has never been held accountable and had to suffer any consequences due to what happened.  If anything there is a code silent code I keep my mouth shut and keep the secret, that is my *responsibility* to keep it in for her.  I am supposed to be around her and my brother who molested me and pretend we’re a normal family.

So basically I’m (F20) finally figuring my life out. I’m getting a job at a place I love, I’m starting college again after being out for two years, and on top of that, my 21st birthday is on Thursday!!!!!

After a lot of contemplation and posting questions on reddit, I have decided to double major in English(creative writing) and Communications. I have to start out at community college first, so I will get my associates in English before I go to a full university for my double bachelors. 

I got the job at the boys and girls club site (different from the one I’ve been volunteering at) that I interviewed for. There’s a lot of steps I have to complete first but I’m very excited. YAY for first time CPR TRAINING! 

Basically the only thing I need to control in my life right now is my health. It’s the most important thing right now, as I have pulmonary hypertension and am also overweight. Hopefully all these new beginnings will whip me into shape. Me losing weight is literally life or death. I need to do this. I just don’t know how. I’m seeing my therapist again on Thursday after going months without it. So yeah I’m finally getting my shit together.... *mostly*. Meaning I still don’t have my weight under control, but hopefully I will get there soon. 

So my question is... HOW on EARTH do I make sure I don’t fuck this up? I always have big dreams for myself and then end up crashing. Sort of like mania-depression but a bit less drastic. I’m scared I will mess something up and fall deeper into depression. Any advice on how to stay positive and get healthy?

35438,7wowdd,csgololhs,Am I crazy for thinking about chasing my dream job?,"Short background - after 9th grade in Europe a lot of students instead of just getting a high school diploma go to a ''professional'' high school, where you study for 4 years, get a high school diploma and also get a qualification in a degree you chose to study. I studied mechatronics and am now at my last year of school, working as an intern at a paper factory. 

Ever since I was like 10 I've dreamed of becoming a pilot, but I don't come from a wealthy family and I don't live in the wealthiest country. The most reputable airliner in my country AirBaltic has a pilot school that guarantees a job as a second pilot in their company after graduating, but the studies cost 70 thousand euros. The airliner will form you a loan, but you also have to pay 10 thousand euros up front. To put that in perspective, if I were to start working full time after my internship ends in the paper factory, I would be making about 6k a year, 9 at absolute maximum. 

Maybe this isn't even a question and I'm just ranting on reddit idk...

38944,7larek,baldwombat,How would you motivate or encourage a coworker to work more or put in some extra effort?,"My current coworker constantly complains about her salary being really low compared to everyone else. She has only gotten a 2% raise since she started over a year ago. I think that if she puts in a lot more effort, speaks up and puts in the hours, she could make the case for a salary increase. The only catch-22 is that how do you convince someone who already thinks they are underpaid to work even more? 

I’ve been working at the company about two years before she started. When I started, my salary was even lower than her starting. But every year I went out of my way to put in extra hours (working 10-12 hr days regularly) and I’ve been rewarded with the appropriate pay raises and bonuses. I’ve tried to tell her this. That she needs to make herself invaluable to the company and therefore she’ll be in a good position when she negotiates her pay. Her response to that was “why should they think they’ll need me when they have you?” I want to scream (in my head) “it’s because I worked my ass off the last 4 years to make them think they need me! You need to start doing that too!”  How...do I say or convey that in a better way??  I really want to help, but I don’t want to say something dumb or sound condescending and discourage her even more.

Should I go back to school?","I’m 25/f with a bachelors degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Child services, Psychology). I spent 4 months post-graduation applying for hundreds of jobs, none of which I got a call back for- except one, that required home visits, travel between 6 counties and paid $9/hr. I declined.

Last year I was working as a retail store manager for the boutique I worked at in college before I transitioned into real estate. I live in one of the fastest growing cities in the us, so it seemed like a good idea to get my real estate license. I’ve had one closing so far this year, which isn’t even enough to cover my desk fees or realtor dues so I’m still in the negative. It’s been about a year since I started and I’m so burned out and tired of not making anything. I made more money in high school working in restaurants. This is a high-profile office, with over half our agents making more than a 6 figure income. With just one sale this year so far that they basically handed to me, I’m surprised I’m still here and they haven’t kicked me to the curb yet. But I’ve put in a lot of time and a lot of money here. It’s just not paying off. It’s all commission based, and I’m nothing like these people (think country-club, married to doctors, my father was the mayor type of people.) I don’t have the connections and my friends/network certainly aren’t buying houses right now. I feel like I tricked them into hiring me because I don’t fit in, and I only got this job because my retail boss knew an agent here. I’m sick of the unpredictability of this job. I miss having a salary.

I feel like I need a masters to make real use of my degree, but I have a low gpa from messing around in college and there is basically zero chance I would make into any graduate program. I would have taken things seriously and majored in something different had I known what the working world and applying for jobs was actually like. 

I’m thinking about going to back to school for something different. I’m tired of being directionless and the burden of having growing debt is eating at me. I’ve managed to survive this past year on savings and help from others, and I feel pathetic for doing so. 

Anyways, I’ve thought about doing a two-year dental hygienist program, or medical sonography, or even accelerated nursing. Something with a promising job market that is stable. I’m tired of feeling lost out there. I want to have a skill that someone will actually pay me for.

What is your experience with going back to school, or not being able to find a job in your field? Any advice is much appreciated."

I was laid off yesterday and I want to make certain I handle everything appropriately. Here are the details.

- Rcvd rest of current check hours + two weeks severance pay
- IF I sign their severance paperwork (which I plan to have two family members review), I get 3 months access to a company paid job placement program, am still eligible for unemployment, and get another check for $4k gross. 

Finance:
- Husband makes 3 to 4 times as much as I was. He would like me to use the money to payoff my credit card, and the rest to cover one bill payment going forward. He thinks he can support us until I get a job. Today I am going through my necessary payments and cancelling subscriptions. I really want to payoff my card as well so I've decided to use the opportunity I've been given. 

- Filing for unemployment today 

- I know I need to review my 401k? I don't know anything at all about that, any advice here would be helpful

Paperwork:
- Today I am reviewing the paperwork I was given and sending it off to family for review
- I'm going to cash the live checks I was given and put them in my obligations account, and budget out future expenses so i know where that money needs to go


Job Search:
- Going to review and update my resume, upload it to Glassdoor, Indeed, and Monster. I reached out to a recruiter yesterday and if I sign the paperwork I'll have the placement program as well

- Any advice on salary jumps to find a new position?  I feel I don't have the right to be picky about jobs right now and would love advice on traps to avoid or when I have the right to say a job isn't good enough to consider 

- A good handful of people reached out to me yesterday for References so I have plenty of those

When I order online they never give me the spicy level I ask for. It's literally not even as spicy as Tabasco. It feels like false advertising because I know they can do spicier they just don't.

I cant get a D or else i get summer school and that fucks up pretty much my whole summer. And i have so much to do that basically i havent started my giant PE assignment, yep can you believe that shit? PE is not supposed to be a assignment class its supposed to be a class that after its over you dont need to worry about! But if i dont this project then my PE grade will for sure be a F because we only ever have 10 point assignment this one is 150 points. And I feel like all my classes say the same thing that you will only pass if you put in your best effort but do they not see that best effort for 6 classes is fucking impossible! And my yearbook class is basically just impossible you never really know what to do in that class then she yells at the whole class and like everyone fails that class. I just can not function I literally stay up till 3 in the morning every day just being so stressed out! And my hair is so thin now that well so bye to the small confidants level that i already struggled to keep. And i came home to my psycho dad who literally just complains about everything in his life and yells all day about crap that i dont care about. All I been able to think about for the last 5 months is killing myself all the stress would go away and I could stop worrying about everything. And dont even say to get a therapist because yea that would be great but u basically told my dad a few months that I was depressed a didnt know what to do and he bascially just started talking about himself and was no help whatsoever and he even said that a therapist is to expensive then he went on some long rant. And the underlining cause of all this is school because i cant think for one second its just shit after shit after shit. And maybe this is the universes way of telling me that I'm not good enough to be here sure my grandma says all the time how I'm so smart but she has not been in fucking school for like probably 40 years now. At this moment right now im so tempted to jump out the window the only reason that I havent is because im not sure its far down enough to kill me but maybe its far down enough to hurt me maybe brain damage or break a few bones if i dont die i can always make up a lie"

My best friend is quiet about giving feedback to me when we hang out, or when we talk online or do our artistic projects together online. It's becoming a concern and it has spawned a terrible case of anxiety for me. I often have to ask her: ""Are you having a nice time?"" ""Are you enjoying this project we are working on together?"" Otherwise I hardly get any kind of feedback from her. I don't know if she's having a nice time unless I ask her. I want her to feel more natural about giving feedback like it's almost second nature. I noticed she does this with another online friend of hers quite a lot and she's not afraid to dish out the feedback or excitment. But when it comes to me, she's very quiet about it most of the time unless I ask.

Is there any way I can make her feel more better about giving feedback? I hate asking her a lot when she's hanging out because I don't know if she's having a nice time, she doesn't communicate to me her feelings half the time and it's stressful for me. I do want to know when she's having fun or if she's enjoying what we are doing together and see that excitement in her.

2295,dhqx42,Brookshone,Is something wrong or am I incredibly lazy?,"I don’t know if somethings wrong with me mental health wise. I think that a part of it is because I’m incredibly lazy and don’t bother to fix anything (my parents echo this sentiment). I believe them because I don’t put my all into fixing my problems but I also feel like I’m incapable of putting my all into fixing them. So I must be lazy right?

But there’s a nagging feeling that somethings wrong with me. Maybe I’m spending too much time looking into mental health issues to fit my problems to a disorder so that I can basically say “it’s not my fault, it’s this.” 

I have a highly irregular sleep pattern. I haven’t been successful in fixing it in months. I just *can’t* which isn’t a good excuse for my dad. He thinks I should just go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday. Which would work, and and I haven’t tried it and given it my all, so thus I am incredibly lazy. 

It’s the same with school work, I just *can’t* commit myself to study. I can’t focus, and I feel like I can’t control it. I don’t know if everyone’s like this, where they can’t study and are bored from it incredibly easy, and just can’t study. But I can’t focus for long periods of time and I don’t know how normal that is. 

The problem is that this behavior is trickling into other aspects of my life too, like showering and cleaning my room. It’s not that I don’t shower and it’s not that I don’t clean my room, it’s that it gets very close to terrible before I fix it. 

I don’t know if any of this is normal, which is the main issue here. If it’s normal, then I can stop worrying about mental health issues and actually figure how to fix everything. I’m just trying to ease my worries."

BUT... one way or other, my recent past &amp; all the things, which lead me to this depressed state of mind, keep on revisiting my mind again and again. And then everything starts falling apart &amp; I'm back to square one.

I get furious, abusive and irritate (in my mind) towards all those people because of whom I've been going through this F\*\*\*\*\* up phase of depression. Going through such thoughts make me feel like a lost soul, a looser, a piece of shit. And ultimately, I end up giving up as far as fighting my way out of this miserable phase is concerned.

I would like to believe that I tried my best to forgive them and hence myself.. so that I can't start all over again.

But now.. I don't know how to handle this anymore.. Actually there's ZERO MOTIVATION.

33607,82oujz,ambiatica,How do I attract positive people?,"Lately I've been befriending people that it is not in any way bad or annoying, but rather 'negative', negative in a sense that they tend to be kind of the depressive 'my life sucks' people.

I respect them, but I sometimes feel many of the conversations we have are a bit heavy to me. I truly enjoy talking to people, but I do sense there's a disproportion of negativity in their life that's kind of poisonous.

About me, I like to have a positive attitude despite I may feel in the hole too, and I wish I could meet people like that, though there may be a reason I tend to 'be likeable' to people not so happy.

Any advice ?¿ Thanks!"
29333,8hr03k,bnjmnmrsh,My brother is emotionally manipulative and my parents are immature and don't bother dealing with him anymore. They've given up and I don't know what to do.,"A little background, my little brother is 15 and I just recently turned 18. He has poor hygiene, he's loud and obnoxious, and he screams and rages at video games all day. He's overall an inconsiderate person and he makes life miserable for me. We share a room, by the way. The manipulation stems from any time I try to ask him to quit doing something. If I beg him to shower, I'm ignored. If I get pissed off, he laughs at me and says ""have fun with that."" He constantly whistles, which he knows pisses me off. I've tried to beg my parents for help, to no avail. When I'm just casually asking him to stop doing something, he'll tell me to calm down, that I'm overreacting. This kind of stuff has been going on for a couple years now, but it just keeps getting worse. I've been begging my parents for help but he just comes out and laughs, asking me, ""What are you doing?""

This kid is malicious and hateful. I just want to finish school and leave home as soon as possible, all because of him. I think my brother needs therapy, but we can't afford it for him. Because of him, I'm beginning to get more and more distant with my family. I'm not sure how well I explained all this, but it's causing me a lot of pain and I'd just like to talk to someone. I try to get out of the house as much as I can but graduation is coming up in a few weeks and I have exams to study for and end of semester work to finish up and my home life is making it very difficult for me to focus.

36506,7st78s,Amazing_dick_punt,Am I A Coward? Not Sure What To Think of Myself,"So I get done early with work and I'm headed to the gym that's near my apartment. I'm about 10 blocks on the last stretch of road when this pickup literally pulls out in front of me. There couldn't have been more than 5 feet between us when he crossed that intersection and I fuckin t-bone the shit out of him. To my surprise this truck takes off. Now I'm fuckin pissed! There was a liquor store in the shopping center he pulled out of so the entire time I'm thinking ""this fucker is drunk and I'm not letting him get away"" so I take off after him. I still can't make sense of it but maybe 2 blocks down the road he decides to stop. I pull my car in front of the truck, to block him. Now the driver starts pressing down the gas, like it's fucking Grand Theft Auto, and starts trying to push my car out of the way. So I'm just going to fucking hurt someone, real goddamned bad. I get out of the car and look in the truck and it's 2 black kids. I was so fucking stunned that I hesitated. I can't beat the shit out of some kids, can I? The passenger gets out and then the driver. So I'm walking around towards the back of my car to grab him because I'm not letting this fucker run from the scene, right? He reaches under his hoodie and into the waistband of his pants and he starts saying ""I didn't do this"", or some weird shit, but that hand totally fucking steals my attention because we're literally 7 feet away from each other - if he fucking shoots me at that range I'm going to be in a little trouble. So I'm trying to quickly put together a plan about what to do if he starts shooting. I can't go left because the vehicles are there. If I go right he can easily cut me off because he making a circular movement around me. So it's like I'm in the middle of this circle and he's walking the perimeter of it,  and trapping me. Behind me is a dead end. I literally envisioned getting shot, right there in the street and all I could think of was ""Don't let this fucking kid take my life. I'll take anything else but don't let me be dishonored like this"". They fucking ran off and I stood there like a jagoff. 

My car is all fucked up, I'll most likely have to drive a rental for a few weeks and they never caught the kid. And to be honest, even if they had caught him I don't think I could have ID'd him because I was not looking to see what pretty color his fucking eyes were. I was watching that hand and trying to time my reaction to the possibility of bullets coming at me. 

I had considered a conceal carry permit for awhile but I'm almost glad I didn't have one because as soon as he reached into that waistband I would have put this kid to sleep. And if he didn't have anything, can you imagine that headline? ""Racist white man shoots an unarmed black teen"". Aside from that I would have to have lived with taking someone's life too. 

I wish I could have done something more brave, and there's a good possibility this kid didn't have a gun but I grew up around Los Angeles and it's no exaggeration that you'd better be paying attention to the kids because they do shoot. And I thought, for a split second, that if the kid was crazy enough to do all this what's to stop him from taking out a witness too? Disappointed at my reaction and wish I had someone else to talk to about this.

PS: Vehicle came back as stolen. They had picked up a kid matching the description I gave and asked me to ID him but I could not say, with 100% certainty, that he looked like the driver of that truck.

25386,9321u1,extraloverboy,I (m18) am engaged to my girlfriend (f18) but I’m still in school.,"So I am 18 years old and I’m a senior in high school. Or I will be school starts up pretty soon. My girlfriend is also 18 but because she took many advanced classes and summer school she was able to graduate early. She is already in her 3rd year of college.  Just for clarification I’m older and will be 19 in about a month. 

I met her my freshman year of high school and we shared most of our classes together. She introduced me to her friends and we became close. I didn’t start dating her till a little before her 18th birthday. So I’ve known her for about 4 years and we have dates for around 4 months. Long story short I proposed and she said yes. 

My parents turned justno and allowed my pervert estranged older brother to move in. A while later we moved out into a house of our own. It’s a long complicated and messed up story. 

But now I’m heading back to my last year of high school. She wears her engagement ring all the time. I wear mine as well and I’m a little nervous. I know I’m going to be the only guy in high school engaged. As well as the only one who lives in a rented home with his girlfriend. What I’m not prepared for are all the questions. I know many will say I’m too young but I disagree. I have an internship at a law firm,a football scholarship, and a good head on my shoulders. My fiancé has a really great paying job as a secretary, is excellent at budgeting and handling money and any other talents. Financially we are able to live on our own rather comfortably. 

But I know everyone is going to ask a million questions and try to see if there is something wrong with us. I’m not going to break the engagement. We work well together and have a very strong and trusting relationship. 

I just need advice as to handle all these questions that are going to come my way.

I will give a few examples. 

-She wants us to print every single email and “never” refer back to the emails again because we have the printed version..

-she wants us to print files that we don’t need until Tuesday on mondays and then out stupid little sticky notes on them to indicate that they exist. 

-she wants us to finish tasks and stay late on Monday’s for shit that can be done on Tuesday mornings

-she bitches about every little thing that’s not done “her” way

-every single aspect of what we do is controlled by her. She even bitched at me for how I got my papers from the printer once. 

How can I suggest change to the VP who put her in charge?

- I say we should not be wasting time and paper printing emails, we reply to the damn emails anyways when there is an issue.. what’s the point of printing for the sake of “not revisiting the emails”? That’s stupid. 

-we should wait to print Tuesday’s files on Tuesday. Number one because it wastes my time on Monday when I’m trying to get other stuff done, and 2 because it’s annoying as fuck searching for the paper when I can literally just search it in my email and print it when I need it. And we should put those idiotic stickies on it.

-we should be sensible and NOT stay late every Monday for shit that can be done on Tuesday. If it’s impossible to get it done on Tuesday, then they need to stop being cheap and hire someone else. But we should not be staying late every Monday. (I was at work from 7am-9pm yesterday. Supposed to get off at 5). 

-my manager needs to not micromanage and mind her own business unless the work isn’t getting done. 

Any advice on this?"

I mention the details about my period because I feel it may play a part in my breast growth?

so 2 days ago, I [m/17] was at a New Years Eve house party hosted by a friend. There I met this girl [f/17] for the first time, she was about to leave a bit earlier than us to head home, and right before she left, she got herself two drinks for the way home and I, in my unlimited stupidity and ""light drunk"" arrogance, just grabbed one of her drinks out of her hand, took a sip and gave it back to her without asking, thinking.. well, I don't know what I was thinking, I just thought it might be cool to be that ""easy-going"" and somehow ""naughty"" guy but now... I just feel guilt for it because I might have ruined her first impression of me.

28859,8kcn90,z______z,Am I justified in my actions or am I just acting spoilt and throwing tantrums???,"Context: I'm an only child and I'm turning 18 this year. I live in Australia. I think I may have been spoilt in my upbringing.

So recently Mother's Day happened in Australia and I completely f-ed up. I had an argument with my dad on Friday (Mother's Day is Sunday) and I was in a crappy mood all weekend. My mother's birthday was in the week leading up to that Sunday so I decided to combine her cards and presents and give them all to her on her birthday. 

So Sunday comes around, I wake up early to make her breakfast (which turns out disastrously because I really can't cook to save anyone's life; Gordon Ramsey would not be proud), and when she wakes up I am still in that really, really, horrid mood. Basically, it causes a huge fight because I didn't tell her I loved her or Happy Mother's Day etc. etc. She goes on to accuse me of not loving her and lying about freeing up my Sunday afternoon just for her, even when I try to convince her otherwise. She also complains that I should have made her a second card for Mother's Day (I hand-make the cards). Eventually I think I just kind of popped under pressure and told her calmly that she was right, I don't love her, and I can't. Obviously she is extremely hurt by my actions, I'm not oblivious to it. 

Here is the dilemma though: 

1) I do actually believe I don't love my mother as much as she loves me. Or my father either. 

They often tell me when they are angry that they are disappointed in the way I've turned out and that I'm selfish, cold and spoilt. If I ever really show true affection towards them, I know there will be a lot of disbelief and skepticism from both of them. I overhear conversations my parents have with each other downstairs and sometimes they talk about my actions say I don't do things with good intentions; that I am doing it for selfish reasons. 

This makes me question whether I have been raised too lax and am throwing 'tantrums' whenever I challenge my parents' authority or believe they are wrong. 

2) When we argue, I never say a word. This is a behaviour I exhibit exclusively to my parents.  From the way my parents describe it, I seem to glare at them and listen silently but not respond. Even when they ask questions like ""Do you understand?"" or ""Do you think so?"" I don't react unless they repeat it several times or sometimes, I don't react at all. 

I seem to have become mute in arguments, or even discussions with them concerning different views because I feel like it doesn't matter what I contribute, I am wrong in the way I think. 

For example, my father was complaining that just because my friends are turning 18, doesn't mean they should be in such a rush to start drinking. Most people who have house parties will supply alcohol at their 18th parties but underage people have to get permission slips from parents (FYI legal drinking age is 18). He stated that these parents should not be allowing their children to have alcohol because then what if their friends can't come to their party or enjoy it because they aren't allowed to drink? This situation applied to me as my father refused to write me a slip to drink alcohol, though it wasn't a big problem because I don't like the taste anyway. However, from my point of view, having alcohol at an 18th was pretty normal here and I expressed that view to him saying that for most parents, they see nothing wrong with it. He then proceeded to get angry, saying that I shouldn't defend other peoples' parents for no reason. We argued about this trivial matter because we couldn't agree. Since I feel like he didn't respect my view on the issue, now whenever we raise the topic of legal underage drinking, I shut down completely and turn abrupt and cold to distance myself from him. 

I don't know if this is a habit I should try to change or not because it seems to be a coping mechanism for me and never happens with anyone else. I don't know how to work on the relationship between my parents and I so that perhaps we can come to actually discuss issues and not argue them. 

To be honest I'm kind of not sure about a lot of stuff.

[TL;DR]
How do I mend my relationship with my mother? Is it necessary that I pose and fake my love/ compassion for her to a degree that I do not feel? It's not that I don't love her, it's just that I don't love her as much as she loves me. 

Am I spoilt and is this just me acting selfishly? I am a Gen Y after all. Maybe I'm just throwing a huge tantrum about this because I have been too privileged in my upbringing. 

Should I strive to change the way I react to criticism to my parents? If so, how do I become more diplomatic in the way I handle things?

Am I ungrateful for wanting to move out and live life without their restrictions? My father was really angry when I mentioned that I wanted to move out for university because I might need to go to another state. He called me ungrateful because I was essentially using them until I didn't need them anymore. 

I'm just very confused. 

Please let me know what you think. I'm really curious about how other people would perceive my situation.

Thanks for reading!

13299,bx3rvi,d_v_c,Weird situation with coworker I like - am I dealing this the right way?,"So I asked this girl out from work a couple of weeks back. She said yes, and seemed very happy that I had asked her out. I was elated too. We went out on a date too, and it was great. She told all her friends too and we seemed to be okay. 

We are not a couple though, honestly so I don't know what exactly I am.

But just a few days back, this ex from her past made an appearance in her life again. Now ordinarily I wouldn't think too much of it but both of them have a LOT of history. I tried asked her about him/them and she's kinda refused to talk about him - she says something vague like 'im dealing with it' or something like that. Of course, I don't want to unnecessarily bother her so I let it be.

Thing is, she's turned into a different person since he got in touch with her. She seems happier overall (which if true is wonderful, but I'm not sure) but she's also gotten more distant with me.

Honestly, I want her to be happy. If being with her ex does that, I'm all for it. But do I 'lessen' my contact with her or something? I mean till now we were talking a lot, we used to spend all our free time together, and we used to talk about some pretty intimate stuff. 

What I have in mind is perhaps maybe backing off a little. Call it intuition/gut-feeling but I do think it's over as far as me and her are concerned. It seemed a bit one sided earlier too, but seemed fine because she almost always said yes to things and seemed happy being with me when we were alone and stuff. 

I still want to be her friend (if she wants) so I'm thinking of cooling things off for a few days - whilst being available for her as a friend if she wants to talk/vent whatever. 

Am I doing this right? Any advice would be welcome."

I guess if you're here you probably want the backstory, huh? I feel so stupid over it, but maybe writing will help. Maybe someone will respond and make me feel less alone. Maybe...Idk. Just maybe. Anyway. Into the story I guess.



Six years ago I met this girl. She was weird af. Theatre kid, into odd shit. Total weirdo.



This total weirdo would wind up becoming my best friend, and for the purpose of this story, we'll call her Angie.



Angie and I haven't always been on great terms. When we first became friends we were really close. Then, she got super close with another girl, who we'll call...Trina. The closer Angie and Trina got, the further away I was driven. After a while I quit talking to her because I didn't feel important. This would happen two more times. The first time we went four months without speaking, and she reached out and we became friends again. The second time I think it was about six months and I reached out. The third time was nine months, and she reached out. The last time she reached out was about one year ago exactly. In between all those ""break ups"" we got really close. Her and Trina quit talking completely. The biggest problem became the boys she would date. They would treat her like shit, I would get angry, eventually couldn't stand to watch it anymore, and then I would leave. Every time hoping she would ask me to stay, and every time being left with silence.



Her and I connected so deeply that we were both convinced we were soulmates. Platonic, but soulmates nonetheless. Both of us believed that soulmates could be platonic, and both of us believe you have multiple.



It's important for you to know that we both, from the very beginning we have both always been straight. I've never been in a relationship, and she's been with two men, and now that I've said this I'm sure you can guess what's coming next.



About seven months ago I started wondering if I was entirely straight. I don't know what made me think about it, but something did. Then shit hit the fan.



About two weeks ago I realized that I had feelings for Angie. I'll never forget it. I was picking up laundry to wash when I realized it. I've always had this idea that I need to find Angie in a man for me to be happy. That if I find the male version of my best friend I'll be set. Then one day the thought occurred to me that maybe I shouldn't be trying to find a male version of her because of the whole ""you can't duplicate people"" thing. Maybe I was just interested in her from the beginning...From there it spiraled.



I began to worry a lot. What did it mean? Why did I have these feelings? How long had I had them? Am I feeling this because I'm lonely or because it's legit? What if this destroyed my friendship? How could I tell her? Could I tell her? What if I told her? It was a lot. I was especially worried that I wasn't actually feeling anything and that I was just lonely. Then we went to the beach for my birthday and that's when the fire nation attacked (I'm depressed. Just roll with the crappy Avatar references)



During the day she would mention that she needed to find a guy like this, or she wanted a man like that, or guy this, guy that. Blah blah blah. And every time she would mention it I would get insanely jealous. At this point I guess it's worth mentioning that I have depression. Diagnosed, untreated. Don't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. I assure you, I do. Anyway, it was at this point that I realized the feelings were real. I panicked.



I made it through the day and promptly went home that night and absolutely lost it. I self-harmed a lot when I was a teen. Abusive home since I was young, no way else to cope...yeah. Anyway, I went about five years without doing it. Then I relapsed back in November of 2018. Then again in March of 2019. Then again last Saturday. When I got home from the beach and promptly lost my shit.



Angie knew something was up the second I got home. We talk 24/7, so she knows how I speak and type. If anything is even remotely off, she'll catch it. And she did. She prodded and prodded until she eventually guessed what was going on and I admitted that, yes, I did have feelings. She told me she didn't know if she could be a couple because she didn't know how she felt about sex with a woman. She then told me that she did, however, have feelings for me.



I was happy. She told me that it wouldn't ruin our friendship, she was glad I told her, and that she would wait for me to figure out what I wanted.



The next day we talked again and I told her I knew what I wanted and that I was just waiting to see where she would land. She told me she was down to try. I was happy again.



Then the next night we hung out at a park and we talked about it. For two hours. She told me she was 80% yes. That she wanted to try, that she could see where it would work, and even confessed to one point in the past a few years ago when she wanted to kiss me. She told me she just needed time to get used to the idea. After a week of anxiety, I felt like I could finally breathe. She wanted me too. She was 80% yes. It was good.



Then today. I've been waiting to get a definite yes or no from her. Today I got my answer.



She told me no.



After all of it. The 80% yes. The wanting to kiss me in the past. Telling me she thought it would work. Talking about how certain people would react to us being a couple. Telling me she wanted to try. After all of this, she said her answer was no. That she only sees me as a friend, and that she's still healing from her ex of over a year.



Needless to say, I shattered. Every time I've ever wanted someone, they never want me back. The last time I really, truly had feelings for someone was six years ago. I wanted this so god damn badly. Wanted it so much I couldn't breathe. I was anxious all day, everyday, for six days. I ate next to nothing because of the anxiety.



I left work 40 minutes early. I got in the car, and broke. For months I've been struggling with my mental health. Depression is a fucking bitch. Because of that depression, I had a suicide plan. Every suicidal person does. Even if they're too scared to enact it, we all know how we'd do it. Mine was simple. Drive to this secluded area an hour away from home. It's in the middle of no where, so no one would bother me. Drive there, plug the exhaust pipes on my car, get back in, take sleeping pills, go to sleep, and voila. Dead.



I made it to step five.



I left work and immediately got on the highway and headed to my suicide spot. There was no hesitation, which was a first. I just got in the car and went. Without thinking. Well...maybe I thought a little, because I stopped at walgreens to buy melatonin, water, and duct tape (to cover the window cracks). I bought a journal too.



At first I was hyperventilating. Not because of the suicide, but because of the rejection. I couldn't breathe. Then the more I drove the calmer I got. It would be over soon. Just a few more hours and then I wouldn't feel any of this anymore. It was so muthafucking comforting.



I eventually made it there, and did exactly what I set out to do. I was shaking, but I wanted to do it, so I did. I opened my trunk, grabbed a cardigan and a towel from the beach that was still sitting there (bigger problems, don't judge me), and I plugged both of my exhaust pipes. I got back in the car, and downed a handful of Melatonin. Idk how many I took. Maybe 50? 60? I knew I wouldn't OD on it. I just wanted to fall asleep before the carbon monoxide affected me in case it gave me a headache or something. Anyway, I downed the Melatonin, reclined my seat back, and laid down. I texted Angie. Told her where I was. Told her I was sorry. That I loved her. Ten minutes later she blew up my phone. Anyway, back to how I'm still breathing. I was dozing off when my phone buzzed (from Angie). I went to grab my phone to check it and I couldn't move my hand. Moving my arm was so hard. I panicked. My survival instinct kicked in. Had she not texted me I've no doubt I would be dead right now. Frankly, I wish I'd just turned my phone off. That's what I get for wanting to know what her last words to me would be. I regret not turning the phone off.



I panicked when I realized I couldn't move my hand, and by some force of adrenaline I opened my door and stuck my head out and breathed. I could smell the grass. It smelled nice.



I eventually wound up sitting on the ground. I don't remember how I got there. Leaning against my car with my door open. I lost it. I sobbed. And sobbed, and sobbed, and sobbed. I've never had so much mascara all over my face before. Was a bitch to wipe off when the random car came down the road to check on the weirdo loser in the Nissan just sitting in a field by herself. Being unwanted by the person you want the most is soul crushing. Make fun of me all you want. Call me a weak piece of shit. I lost a piece of myself today, and I don't know if I'll ever get it back.



That's essentially it. I sat there for three hours. Just sat there. Sobbing. Texting. Wondering why I'm not enough. Being angry that I didn't just stay in the fucking car. As I'm writing this I'm sitting in a motel room. Couldn't find my laptop charger, so I'm working on what little battery I had when I left the house. I don't know where I go from here. My head head hurts from crying. My stomach is a disaster from all the Melatonin. Mostly my fucking heart hurts. So god damn bad. I've never been this crushed by a rejection. I don't know how I get over this. Idk where I go from here. I don't know anything except that this destroyed me.



If you read all of this, thank you. Thank you for listening. Idk that I feel any better, but I like having this exist in the world somewhere. Idk why. I just do. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. I feel like I’m just screaming internally and I’m tired of only hearing my own voice.



The journal I bought only has one thing written in it. I wrote it before I took the Melatonin. I was hoping it would be my last words, and I'm sad to say I still believe it.

36773,7ruy7v,throwaway2k17,My 14yr old sister just wrestled her mother for her phone when she got in trouble - what now?,"My sister has always had little discipline. She now got her phone taken away and I had to help get her off of our mother when she took her phone away. 

Every time my sister does get in trouble she goes to the extremes - she claims abuse when my mom doesn't lay a hand on her and does a million things for her, she says she's running away, she gets obnoxious and after my mom disciplines her, she sits out their and continuously puts our mom down - insulting her, calling her names, all kinds of things.


They're sitting out there arguing, my sister broke my moms door and my sister didn't stop following her until my mom threatened to break her phone with a hammer. That is the only way they stopped moving throughout the house. They're not stopping and my sister thinks she's invincible - she's threatening to just walk out the house and its 9pm at night. 

She never understands she's wrong, we do so much in terms of helping her and she claims the worst life possible the second she gets in trouble, like she's trying to guilt my mother into not punishing her. She's saying she wont go to school now and all types of wild stuff..


What should my mom do?

21339,as221w,throwaway190219,Late pregnancy in difficult relationship with two kids,"My wife and I have been married for 9 years and we have two kids with 8 and 6 years old. We both turned 40 recently. We love our kids very much, however, our relationship is rather difficult and the kids are probably the real reason we are staying together. We fight a lot and we are really suck at finding pragmatic solutions to immediate and also long-term problems. We both have plenty of shit to deal with ourselves, including ADHD, so our relationship can also be pretty up &amp; down. We both struggle to make our career happen next to having a family. As our kids are now 6 and 8 years old, we  enjoy the new found quality of life and can make some progress in our career. The first few years after birth have been hell for us. Our financial situation is also constant reason for arguments. We have done some counselling and we will continue to do so. But the success of that was rather limited so far. It is not unlikely that we will break up within the next months or years to come.

Anyhow, occasionally we still share a few good moments and in the most recent one, our condom failed on us. Long story short, she is pregnant and we are completely lost and looking for advice on what to do. We are considering an abortion and time is of the essence.

We both feel like we are in a different phase of our lives now and that we are too old to go through all the craziness of having a baby in the family again. We usually manage to give our two kids the love and attention they need, but I am not sure if we have enough capacity to keep this up with three kids in the house. As a breakup may be on the horizon, we are scared to have another kid. 

Any advice on how to approach our situation...? Please no fundamental discussion on abortion!

This all started when she was looking at the college I recommended for her and her parents saw it. The mom said she isn’t dorming, in a stern manner. At first I thought it was a joke but it’s actually pretty serious. I told her my opinion on it, saying that they can’t hold you against your will once you hit adulthood. And if they do then I’ll call the police. She agreed, but I’m still having doubts regarding the situation, which is why I came here. I’m not sure what to do in this situation once it gets out of hand. Her parents have had a checkered past, so I’m nervous. What do I do if she reaches adulthood and her parents hold her against her will?

I should add that I’m 17."

Now I live 200 miles away, she has a kid, but is single, but I think it's definitely too late because our careers are in full effect and we're too far away. Yet, I've always regretted saying no. I just wonder if it would be a horrible idea to bring it up and ask her what she thinks and if it could've happened eventually. I'm sure she definitely won't want to start a long distance relationship with someone she hasn't been near since high school graduation. Would I be a creep if I did this, or is it a bad idea in general? I just want some closure but I feel like this might make things worse.

He’s a pretty good guy and did a good job of raising 4 kids (all were my moms, he’s never had any of his own) and has been a loving grandpa to two girls. I had been suspecting my mom of cheating for a couple of months now and when I was taking a picture with her phone a dirty message from a man who is definitely not my stepdad popped up. I said nothing to her but went through her phone later that night and discovered she is cheating with MULTIPLE men. Many dirty texts (no nudes thankfully) but also lots of messages that would indicate that this has been going on for a long time. Some of these men are married so not only could I be splitting up my family, i could be splitting up others as well. I have kind of hinted to my mom that I know she’s cheating but I don’t think she’s caught on yet. I know I should confront her but I feel terrible knowing that I could possibly split up the family. My stepdad is a very nice man but a little lonely. His family lives across the country and he works a lot so he only has a few people who would be here for him should they divorce. His family absolutely adores us kids and have been so loving and accepting of us from the day they met us. My mother’s family has taken him in as well. He has become close with almost everyone on that side and they care for him. I am scared to ruin things with both sides of my family. Out of us four kids, 2 are living on their own and have kids, 1 in college(me), and 1 who is in high school. If my parents split up, my younger sibling and I would lose all stability in our home. He is definitely the breadwinner in the house and I fear that I will have to drop out of college to help my mom support my sibling. I also would have no way of paying my tuition. I have known about my Mom’s infidelity for about a month now and every day I sit in limbo with my decision it eats me alive. If I say nothing I will live with the guilt for the rest of my life but if I do tell I could be responsible for splitting up multiple families.

This afternoon I was about to go meet up with some friends. I went into my room and grabbed this cap thing with no nicotine vape juice in it. Last night, at a party I held onto it for a friend but he left before I was able to give it back. He also gave me $5 so I thought, why not? Anyways my dad saw me putting it in my pocket and told me to take out whatever I just put in my pocket. I took it out and handed it to him and told him I didn't know what it is and it wasnt mine. I also told him that a friend that gave it to me (true). My friend and I are both 13 but he's 6ft tall and he would kick my ass if he doesn't get it back. My dad also said tomorrow we would be going to talk to his parents but I would also get my ass kicked by the kid. I was caught vaping a year ago and put that in my past, haven't used any vapes ever since. My dad was pretty pissed and left for work and I don't wanna lose our trust especially since I was just ungrounded for a unrelated reason. I know I deserve the consequences and should not hold onto things for people when I know it's wrong. I've also learned when my dad caught me for example with another phone (use it at night, keep other phone next to his nightstand) and he grounded me for it, it just taught me to hide it better. I'm pretty sure he also thinks I'm lying. Just to be clear, I don't do any of that vaping shit anymore and don't mind it as long as it doesn't hurt anyone. Keep in mind I have a 4.0 GPA and great school behavior marks. Also I did not have the device or battery just the liquid. What should I do?"

Fast forward to today and I'm graduating very soon. I've applied for at least 30 jobs up and down the country in my field, without getting a single interview. I'm broke, can barely afford to live here and have no friends. 

My boyfriend is keen to settle down but he's been denied citizenship and is talking about us starting over in another country 3000 miles away. 

While I admit I have no ties here whatsoever, my degree is only really valid in this country. I don't really want to move again, certainly not that far. Also due to my disability and health conditions, not every country would be suitable for me to live in. 

I feel massively depressed right now. I have no interest at all in my degree anymore and its a struggle to complete the last pieces of work. It feels like the last 3 years have been a waste of time and I should have just started working here straight away in some random entry level career (what I was already doing back home) and tried to work my way up.

They're not fucking I'm just hearing things. ect ect.

1589,dkz0d3,3d_person,Is the IPhone 6S still worth it?,"Hey, guys!

So, I am an android user, never used an IPhone or any other Apple products before.
The reason why I want to buy an IPhone is because I started to become frustrated  with android's slugghisness and random glitches. The system became slower and slower after each update and there is no way to go back to it's original update without rooting the phone and Samsung phones are pretty hard to root. (Also, the phone freezes randomly, numerous times a day, it enters other apps on it's own, calls wrong numbers, freezes when I turn on mobile data or wi-fi after a while etc.)
So what I want to do is to try an IPhone and see if it is worth it. But currently my budget is pretty tight so I don't want to invest in the newer models yet, plus i don't even know if I would like them or not.
So I decided to buy an 6S, but since I know it is an older model, I wanted to ask you guys how does this model keep up with current apps and if it is a reliable option, at least until I get used to Apple products and can afford something new.

Thank you for the answers in advance!"
10459,cbibyk,RunDaPak222,I was robbed at gunpoint and have been told my phone might still be recoverable?,"Hi, I’m new to this whole process so I apologize for any formatting issues. A few weeks ago I was robbed at gunpoint for the brand new IPhone XR my brother had bought for me as a birthday gift. Before that I was using the I phone 5, and it was pretty messed up so a new phone was great  for the time it lasted. I live in New York, and while walking down the block with my homie, a dude with his hand deeeep in his vest pocket came out his p’s (projects) and ordered us into the stairwell. Now though I could have hit the dash these projects are known crip territory and I could tell he was strapped up. we took a step forward into the building and a brown and black gun was on us within a matter of seconds. He brought us up a few stories where two other locs were chilling. Now the whole process took about an hour and a half before we finally got out so I’m going to try and only describe in detail. After demanding our phones, my friend was very reluctant and was punched in the head very very hard. After he got knocked in the head I tried to run down the stairs but the youngest of the three, a kid in a blue hoodie grabbed me and threw me back into the corner. They took our backpacks off, patted us down and emptied our pockets pretty quickly. My friend was still recovering from that head shot, and quickly unlocked his phone this time. They took all the money I had been saving to my name out of my wallet, and then asked me to unlock mine. I tried to be witty and pretend like I didn’t know my Apple ID, but the dude in the vest started screaming about him being tired of ppl playing with him and took his gun out again. After a few more minutes of searching us, the third and final dude pulled his gun on the first guy who apparently owed him money, and the dude reluctantly gave it all up except one of the phones. They started to yell about it, and I recognize this gun as a glock, being held by a dude who also seemingly “just got out of rikers” The third dude, who was now in control, started asking the first dude if he was dealing with us which scared the shit out of me because I had heard of execution style killings in the stairwells of the area. He said yes, and after the other two went back upstairs, he told us we were free before running down past us and out the building. In physical shock. We sat on a bench outside for a few minutes before returning home to an angry mother. Some of my friends helped me save up to buy an I phone SE a few weeks afterwards but apple should seriously make an emergency lockdown mode where the phone discreetly can’t be logged out of in an emergency... I was just recently told that my phone can be tracked even after being logged out of  iCloud but the apple workers said it isn’t possible. Is my phone really gone forever?"

I don't even get to voice that I like them so when a friend says it I kind of just die inside because now I don't want to tell my friends I like that person because it would cause drama. I liked a guy at my highschool since freshman year and didn't tell any of my friends yet and then the next year my friend told me that she had a crush on him which made me so sad because she's more social and fairly better looking than me. So they end up dating.

Fast forward to recently. I was hanging out with a group of friends and for the first time since the other guy I started liking this dude in our group. He's funny and smart and just nice so I was kinda happy that I'd get a chance to know him more. Later that day my friend who was with the group tells the girls in the group that she likes him. Of course. Even though she said she was talking to others guys and girls I guess she just liked him too. But now everyone in the group is trying to get her to tell him and hang out with him while I sit back and let my feeling die, because there's no point in saying I like him now that she's said it. 

It's just frustrating. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or why this is so hard. I could handle it the first time this happened but now it's starting to hurt.. can someone please give me advice? What do I do when this happens or what can I do to fix it? I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this, sorry it was kind of me venting."
16541,bhhwc8,Carrrl20,My [M15] parent just destroyed my ethernet cable and threatened to destroy my pc which I saved up for years to get.,"To get this straight, I just want to have a normal parent/son relationship and I don’t want to start any longer feuds which I will explain soon. Also, sorry for yucky mobile formatting.

To start, my parents are increasingly getting on to me for using my pc. When I ran an Ethernet cable to my pc about a week ago, the deal was I would always be off by 12. I was in my last game of fortnite for the night and was watching xQc ( a streamer ) get destroyed by stream snipers. My dad walks into my room at 11 and tells me to go to bed soon. I simply say I will soon. 30 minutes later, he walks in and tells me to go to bed now. I’m in the middle of a game in the competitive mode so I can’t just leave. I tel him I’ll finish this game and get off as quick as I can. He then walks in 5 minutes later, moves my desk and just rips my ethernet cable in half in front of me. It was 11:32 when it happened so I was still in accordance with what I thought was the deal I had made with my parents. I’m guessing I’m just overreacting but I’m extremely upset as my parents are already extremely restricting and I use my pc as a coping mechanism for other mental issues I have. If my dad actually destroys my pc, I’m concerned it will push me over the edge and I’ll do something to myself but at the same time I’m concerned that if I say anything I’ll just be told to suck it up and that mental health is fake. If I’m overreacting just tell me, but if this seems like it actually is an issue I need to fix, how should I go about doing it? Even if this was just a communication issue, I’m sick and tired of my dad pressuring me about every little thing and I just need to know what I should do.

Additional note: I can’t escalate anything beyond what it currently is because my parents pay for me to go to private school and they course transfer me back to public school which I got bullied and verbally abused at but a large group of people. Also, I don’t want my parents to take my phone as a means of finding advice for my current situation."
10070,cddq0r,SeasonedRice,I am 25 years old and having a weird racial/relationship/existential problems,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

In all honesty, I am a tad drunk while writing this, but for good reason(s) which are racially and ethnically premised.

&amp;#x200B;

I am Japanese-Mexican-Hawaiin guy and I recently broke up with my girlfriend of, well, 1 and a half years. My ex-partner is 21, so younger, but they're also the same ethnic mix as me (Japanese-Mexican-Hawaiin/what are the chances) and I literally feel so many emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on coming to terms with that fact that there are other people on the planet with the same ethnic mix as me in the United States, but I've never had a chance to meet someone with that same background as me before -- It's crazy. I say this, in the sense, that white folks usually get easy pickings with other white folks, but as a multi-ethnic person, shit like this is rare; it carries a lot of meaning, whether warranted or not (not that I'm trying to devalue what I've been through). 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially we both had problems and decided to break up, but remain friends, and I even told her that ""I hope we grow old together, whether it's as a 'coupon', or as 'friends'"" I know, I'm romantic (props to ya boi). But I just can't stop thinking like I'm missing a chance; that is, I won't meet someone like them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I know relationships aren't all about race/ethnicity, and I can probably find some white person who matches me just as well as they do -- but it just feels less meaningful (Yes, I know ""meaningfullness"" is a social construct, but I'm drunk and emotional, so give me a break). In the meantime, I've been, possibly unhealthy, having sex to fill the void (with whomever wants me).

&amp;#x200B;

I just need some help. Perhaps someone to talk to who's been in a similar situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I'm mult-inethinic, broke up with someone who has my same ethnicity; feeling incredibly horny; drunk; wondering who I can run to because I'm scared to like a white person.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks."
24667,96te3f,JimMakingTheFace,My friend went behind my back and contacted the guy who assaulted me,"Last night I went to hook up with a guy. I don’t know him well at all. He had been drinking, but was completely coherent and insisted. He wound up holding me down and fingering me violently until I begged enough for him to get off of me, and then he just handed me my clothes and told me to go. 

I went to my best friend in confidence because I was freaking out. She convinced me to go to the hospital, but I didn’t want to get police involved. 

So after being in the hospital all night I woke up to a desperate message from the guy asking what he did wrong and begging me to talk to him. My friend went behind my back and contacted telling him how awful he was for hurting me etc etc. 

I don’t know how to handle this. I probably will never see him again. I don’t want to press charges. I know he’s having some unrelated personal issues right now (not that it excuses anything), but I just don’t want to do this. 

I was hoping I would just never contact him and never see him again, and now that doesn’t seem possible. And my friend completely betrayed my trust because she swore she wouldn’t say or do a thing without getting my permission first.

I feel so empty. I don’t know how to handle any of this.."

26064,8zgqf6,alessandra_vargas,my roommate won't pay for rent and is ditching me while I am on vacation across the country is there anything I can do?,"It all began last summer when I needed a new roommate because things were not working out with my grandmother. I found one mid-way into the lease and never asked her to pay for the original deposit to move in of $400 (which every place asks for in my area, so it was not brand new to her), she didn't pay it, and silly me let it slide because I trusted she would not suddenly leave. Therefore, she is not on any contract or any proof that she has been living there except for her statements on Venmo. Fast forward July 2018 when it is time to pay for rent, (just a side note, she was always very punctual about paying bills, never really had a problem) no sign of her, no messages returned through text or social media. I was very concerned so I began to spam message her through Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, texts, anywhere I thought I would be able to reach her from. Nothing. In one of the Facebook messages, I said to her ""let me know if you are still planning on living at the house, if not, so I can find a replacement"". The day after our rent was due, we always have a set deadline every month so it was also no surprise of when the rent was due, she finally responds to me via Snapchat explaining that she had to spend her money unexpectedly and was not able to pay for rent however, her boyfriend was going to help her our financially and she would pay any fee that came along with being late for the rent and towards the end of the message she replies with ""but you know what, find your little replacement, psycho"". It has now been a week and a couple days and still no response from her, she hasn't paid for anything yet the rent or any of the bills. I finally received a reply from her boyfriend.  I asked him ""hey how is she doing? if you see her can you tell her to contact me or do you think you can at least let me know what her plan is""? His response just was, ""she is moving I think"". And that was the end of the conversation. Up until this day, I have not heard from her and I am currently on the hunt for a new roommate. So is there anything I can legally do to get her to pay the rent for this past month? "
6124,cxh62e,N0IDENT1TY,I can't keep hard at 18 (sex),"Hey,

So I'm 18, nearly 19. I practice lots of sport, am confident, get lots of attention from girls (thanks jawline), and I've never had much of an issue getting into bed with a girl. I've currently been with 10 women (yesterday got into double digits), but I have a massive issue.

So I'm uncircumcised, and when I get hard and a girl starts sucking me off, well, if she pulls the skin back (doesn't hurt to pull it back), the head of my penis is so sensitive it hurts and I immediately lose my erection.

If she doesn't pull the skin back, fuck it I just don't find it hot and I start overthinking everything and get nervous my heart starts beating fast and I lose it.

If we are about to have sex and i have to stop to get a condom, my heart beats faster i get nervous and i lose it.

This all just throws my game round. I haven't been with more girls because of this and I'm scared I might catch a STI from unprotected sex (since I can't physically stay hard long enough to put a condom on).

Any advice?"

When working together in person, our days are filled with standing very close to each other, looking into each other's eyes and talking quietly. Also, loudly drinking later.

Yeah, so laid it all out there very clearly in a message to his personal email and no response for days. WTF.

What sort of person receives a love letter and decides that no response is the best way to go? There isn't any way to know what he's thinking, but still I wonder... What is he thinking? Finally, I feel there's a 99% likelihood that I haven't received a response because he's not into me and moreover that I've offended him in some way, but why not just let me down easy if that's the case?

12558,c0w6q1,lukestorm22,I found a message on her phone? What do I believe?,"So basically I ended things with this girl, shes ended things with me multiple times before, and then I came back and asked if we could talk things through rationally and make it work. She eventually allowed that and we have been together and happy for the last week now.

She told me after I broke up with her she had a guy in her bed spooning her and touching her. She said they definately didnt have sex, and I said its fine if you did because I broke up with you, but shes sticking to the fact she didnt sleep with him.

After a week together non stop since, I know shes not seeing him, but I was setting her alarm and saw a message ""so fucking drunk"", from this guy. I shouldnt have but I opened it. The message originally said ""do you want to come over for a J, ill treat you how i should"", then few hours later was the message saying he was drunk.

I raised it and was honest and apologised for looking. Shes agreed not to speak to him now. She said its awkward to tell him she has a boyfriend now, which I understand, and I said its not right for you to be friends with him though if he is seeing it in that way.

My question is, how much do I believe? She could message him secretely now and say to be careful, she could keep him on the hook till we have an arguement and then go back to him? and did she actually sleep with him or is she telling the truth that she didnt?

This girl has such a high sex drive, and she says its only with me, but I strongly doubt that she had this guy in her bed and nothing happened, especially when hes sending messages like that?

Ive pressed on this point so much with her now that she thinks im resenting her or going to use it against her, when in reality I just want the truth. 

I know she spends every day with me and leaves me with her phone and doesnt appear to be hiding anything but I dont know what to think now..."
8237,cma2v6,Sparky159,"GF emotionally cheated on me, we got back together, but now I can't trust her","So about a month ago, I (22M) found out that my girlfriend (21F) was talking to another guy (34M). At that point, we had been dating a year and a half, and I was intending on proposing to her on our 2nd anniversary and actually getting married around our 3-4th anniversary (so I could finish my degree and then get married). However, this incident has really shaken the confidence in myself, our relationship, and my trust in her. Granted, these are all natural responses, but it doesn't make things any easier.

&amp;#x200B;

I have verified proof that they didn't have sex, but that they did go on dates and he did touch her sexually. This infuriates me to no end, and makes it hard for me to be intimate with her again after knowing that. I know that she feels absolutely terrible about it, and doesn't really hang out with her coworkers (she works in a salon) much anymore because they were the ones that hooked her up with this guy to begin with. Her parents borderline disowned her because of it, and my parents don't want much to do with her either. My brother (30M), who I'm sharing an apartment with, has even put restrictions on how frequently she can come over. She can really only come over on the weekends, but even then she works on Saturdays and I work Mon-Fri.

&amp;#x200B;

The part that's scaring me is how much I don't trust her anymore. I used to trust her 100%, but now I find myself questioning every little thing that she does. I find myself checking her location via snapchat, anxiety flaring up when she doesn't respond to my messages in a timely manner, and checking her phone (with and without her permission). These are all toxic and controlling behaviors, but I don't know to shove these feelings to the side and trust her again. 

&amp;#x200B;

For people who've been cheated on and got back with their S/O, when do these feelings go away? When did you stop going through their phones and start trusting them again?"

I’ve got an incredible family who wants to help. I’ve got a home that’s paid for 2.5 hours away. I’ve been over underground construction for a local electrical company, pissed off the bosses son and now I’m jobless. I’m 2.5 hours from home, been here 6 months, moved up here to escape small town life. The city is amazing, I love it here. And I’m genuinely happy. But now I’m carless, and I’m about to have rent due, which I can cover but it’ll be tight, and jobless. The economy here is booming in my industry, and I’m hoping after the Labor Day weekend I’ll get some call backs (job lost Friday, been applying since). Can’t tell my family yet, as they’ll expect me to come back home. I want to rent my home there, and stay in the city, but I’m having a hard time telling them. 

To make it worse, I met an incredible girl here, we’ve had a trip planned for a while and are leaving tomorrow for 2 days. If I come back feeling the same/better about us, I really don’t know how I’ll be able to leave. She’s been incredible to me. Drove me 2.5 hours home at midnight to check on my OD’d cousin, let me sleep both there and back, got back at 630, and she went to work at 7. I got sick on our third date, and while I cleaned myself, she cleaned my car. She’s thoughtful, hasn’t dated in 6 years, and feels (in her words) “very very different about me than she has anyone else”. 

I’m 21, I’ve got a grand in the bank, and some stuff I could sell, but I’m uncomfortable. I’m not sure where to turn or what to do.

I’m thinking I could find a place to move in for maybe 500-600, move there and try to find a cheap car (have been ubering for a week). But life gonna be tight for me. 

Can I even get a car loan now? I wouldn’t have a problem paying it, as I do side jobs and will be renting my house as soon as I can get comfortable. 

What would y’all do? 

Maybe after this trip, I go home, get my house rentable (need to get my furniture and such), get it rented, and move back $1400 richer (deposit+first months rent)."
27439,8s14jz,Orangecup05,Quit my job today.,"I work or worked at a pretty rough place. I've only been there a couple months.

The job was tough but it was good and I liked it until the boss rehired a guy who left long before I was ever hired.

Fyi: this isn't a normal type of job. It's pretty much under the table, show up when you want type of thing. Nothing normal about it.

This guy is just... Flat out nuts. He's a heavy drug user (meth, heroin, LSD, cocaine, MDMA, alcoholism, marijuana) and he's got a criminal history that includes armed robbery, breaking and entering, assault, sexual assault, stealing cars and he's served prison time for some of it too. That's all been corroborated by multiple sources. He looks like you'd expect too. Skinny yet strong, face tattoos, neck tattoos sleeve tattoos, scars all around his eyes and mouth, broken nose, missing teeth...

Anyways, he took a bunch of drugs and got drunk at work and he told me something I wish I never heard. He told me that he killed a drug dealer to score when he didn't have any money... And that's not what he went to prison for. He was never caught.

So I decided I'm outta there. I don't want to work with a murderer -especially one that hasn't been prosecuted and served time for it.

I asked around for advice on what to do about him. I have a conscience and can't ignore it. I asked a lawyer and a police officer, both close to me and they both said the same thing. Basically, without evidence this goes nowhere. If he doesn't spill the beans himself, there's going to be nothing that happens except police interview him and that he tries to find out where I live and cause hell for me. And I was informed in under no legal obligation to do anything.

But anyways... I quit.

You think I did the right thing, at least for me?

There's not much I can do about the psychotic, drug addled murderer... But hey, this job was new and I don't actually need to be working right now.

During my final year in high school, I was undecided between studying Civil Engineering or Computer Science. I was a high achiever in school so Engineering was an option because of the prestige around it (and I had an interest in structures as well).

I chose Engineering because I was advised that it will be better paying and I had no idea what I wanted to do with a CS degree, other than continue to learn to code.

But I guess that feeling this way over the years has actually conditioned my brain to abhor at any form of drug-taking. 

Now I'm not trying to be some kind of saint, I don't like that I feel this way tbh - especially now that I'm dating my partner of a year, and we've both said from the start that we have to be honest with each other and that he had to hide his desires from his last ex. 

And almost everything about him is perfect... Except that he's taken every drug available while I've never even smoked weed, and it makes me really question whether he is the man I want to spend my life with when I consider that he still wants to do all these things that I consider a part of youthful exploration, not the actions of a 33 year old man.

I hate looking at him when he can barely open his eyes, and when he falls into a drug-fuelled sleep at 7pm across both sides of the bed, so I have to sleep in the spare bed. I hate that he would rather sit in his 24 year old mates smoke-filled living room than spend one of the only 2 days/nights I get off a week with me, and I end up falling asleep alone, because he'll fall asleep there and won't come home til morning.

But he also works fucking hard, and he hates his job, so who am I to tell him he can't do what he needs to relax.

    So, before I started my first college semester, I was a part of a Facebook group for my college class. People were introducing each other all over the place, and I came across one person that seemed really interesting. We had a lot of the same interests, and this person seemed to have a good head on their shoulders. I liked their post, but like an idiot I never commented on it or put out a friend request. I guess I just assumed that I would see this person around when college started.  
First semester goes by, I made a few friends here and there, got really solid grades, and my adjustment to college life was very smooth. My one regret, however, is that I never got to talk to this person, and I saw them around rather frequently, but always in passing, and never long enough to introduce myself.  
So now, I'm entering into my second semester. I'm off to a good start and am generally optimistic, but I still can't get this query out of my head: Should I even bother talking to them at this point? It's not helped that I still see them every other morning on the way to a class.

32415,85zchw,throwaway40136,Waited to long to say something,"Hello, my problem is a bit long, but I don't really have anyone to talk to at the moment, so I will just post it here.

It started around 6 months ago when I met a girl in my dancing class. We got along really well and started to also hang out outside of class. For the first 2 months I didn't want to admit it to myself, (because of bad past experiences) but I absolutely have a crush on her. We kept hanging out and after some time I had the feeling that she liked me in the same way.

Now I should mention that I usually don't have any problems talking to and hitting it of with women who I don't really know, like at parties, or from dating apps. But when it comes to women I know well, or even friends, I get extremly nervous, afraid that I could ruin the relationship for good (again, bad past experiences). So of course I didn't say anything, but kept spending time with her.

Now last weekend I have noticed that she started to spend a lot of time with another guy. They are not in a relationship yet, but very close to it.

So now I am feeling awefull. I didn't sleep in 2 days and I am feeling really down when at home. I constantly blame myself and just feel like shit.

I don't know what to do. On one side I want her to be happy, on the other side I am feeling god awefull knowing that I didn't talk to her. But I am afraid that if I talk to her about it that it would change our relationship forever. I really value her as a friend.

Sorry for the long story, but it had to come out. Also, english isn't my first language, so I'm sorry if my wording is bad."

But more importantly, I chose a contract, part time position so I can continue to peruse outside interests and be home for my children during the summer months.  This was discussed at the time of hiring.  I was hired part time, 12-18h/wk for 16 months.  The hiring manager has since retired.  My schedule for the summer has me down for full time hours for 4 weeks over July/August to cover vacations.  (No one asked me about this before creating the schedule) Although I technically can do these hours, it comes at the cost of my family and my other commitments, and frankly, I don’t want to do it.  I gave this company priority, and have been scheduling my other activities around my work schedule, so to have it suddenly changed (problem 1) coupled with this vacation thing,  is more than infuriating.  Its still unclear if I’m contractually obligated to work full time over the holidays (waiting to hear back from HR) But regardless, I’d like to tactfully explain to this director why expecting this of me is crap.

Im so grateful for my family and everything they have done for me. words cant express how much i love them and how much it breaks my heart how things have come to be. I didnt have much friends growing up as i was bullied in elementary school and middle school by pretty much most of the students and the teachers mostly treated me like garbage. I often found myself alone with my thoughts throughout school. I started acting up a lot with my family and i let out my frustration from school on my younger brother which is the worst thing i could’ve done to him. He barely speaks to me anymore and its been years since ive had a decent conversation with him. I lost all academic motivation so I didn’t complete any school work which birthed more problems with my parents.  besides the on going dilemma with my brother, my parents and I were always arguing as i was the problem child. Since i have social phobia it makes it hard for me to open up to people  because i fear that ill be rejected or made fun of again. It sounds like im being a pussy i know but when people tell you that you’re a worthless piece of shit at a young age every day it tends to stick.  So i feel thats what i became.. a loser.

On paper, our relationship is everything one could want... we are financially stable, have lots of family support and healthy friendships, we treat each other with kindness and respect, we have similar visions for what we want in our future, etc. But our values are misaligned on some items, more a matter of how we prioritize them than what we value though.

I worry that over time these misaligned priorities will cause resentment. I worry he will resent me because I simply don't have the desire to meet the same level of standards he holds for our house, cars, etc. I worry I will resent him because he sees a lot of the things that make me happy as unproductive uses of time.

20219,axilsv,shendrad,Disabled or Enabled?,"Novel length, TL;DR My disabled brother not on disability lives with me for free, spends plasma donation money on liquor to party with friends. What do I do?
My brother is functionally disabled. He spent his teen years repeatedly getting concussions because he and his friends would perform backyard wrestling stunts for fun. Chairs to the head, jumping off of sheds onto tables, etc. When he was 15, he got a brain injury from a car accident. As a result, he struggles with memory, critical thinking, planning ahead, and decision making. He has never been formally diagnosed with a disability though, and never received disability benefits. Our mom made him go to college with her. While she took criminal justice classes, she held his hand and made him get a 2 year degree in computer networking. She drove him to classes, rode his ass and made him do his assignments and turn them in. They both went deep in debt, and our mom went on disability right after graduation while my brother went on to work at Arbys until he was fired for throwing a customer's coin change at the back of their vehicle in the drive through. 
Years ago, our mom kicked him out of her house and he came to stay with my husband and me. We gave him 3 months to get a job. I did everything I could- gave him rides to the library to apply for jobs (time he spent mainly playing on Facebook) and brought home a lot of paper applications for businesses nearby. I told him he needed to show us that he was making an effort or we would put him out and he would be homeless. I thought the prospect of living on the streets would motivate him but the deadline came and he hadn't received any calls for interviews. 
I told our mom that we were putting him out so she came and saved him, letting him move back in with her. 
While we helped him pack, I found every application I had brought for him, completely blank. 
Life went on, he worked a couple of jobs briefly, eventually he met a woman and they got informally married. The years he spent with her, he never got a job or signed up for disability benefits. She filled out job applications for him but, for whatever reason, he never got called. They managed to live off of her disability benefits and her food stamps, barely scraping by the whole time. 
Most recently, after a couple of years together, she decided she wanted to separate and wanted him to move out. For the first time, they filed a request for all his past medical files. They made it sound like they were actively trying to get him signed up for disability benefits and she said she had an apartment lined up for him once he got approved for benefits. He asked me if he could stay with my husband and me for ""a couple of weeks"" while everything was pending. We agreed, but we made it clear that it wasn't going to take just a couple weeks to get on disability and to get everything straightened. We also said he couldn't spend all day every day doing nothing, sitting on the couch. He didn't seem to believe us or just didn't want to acknowledge it. It has been just over a month since he moved in and his time has been spent playing video games, sleeping, donating plasma and using the money to buy liquor to take to parties at his friends' places. He went to one appointment with what he called a ""head doc"" but he said it was ""not as helpful as he expected"" and that is literally the only thing we have seen him do regarding his situation. 
I love my brother a lot and want to help him but I feel like I am enabling him by letting him just live off of me. Our mom lives about 45 minutes away, out in the country, isolated. She is a bit crazy, delusional at times (if a plane flies over her house, she is convinced it is the government spying on her), and controlling. She would take my brother in but then she would also try to control his life. With no car and no income, he would be mostly trapped out there, with only my mom's barely functioning vehicle as transportation. She herself survives on disability benefits and food banks, so she can't offer him much financial support either. 
Our mom and me are the only family he has to lean on. His father is out of the picture but has led a similar life, struggling to retain employment, living off of relatives and government assistance most of his adult life. 
If he didn't have his mental problems, I would have put my foot down a long time on his mooching but our mom has made it clear she expects me to cater to him, hold his hand (she suggested that I get him a job at the hospital where I work, in my department, which would mean I [or someone else] would have to work directly with him to keep him focused and productive) and be there for him financially the rest of his life. Right now, we are coming up on the 5th week of him living with us and he used his plasma donation money to buy Greyhound tickets and liquor to go out of state to party with a former girlfriend for 9 days. 
My husband wants to send him to live with my mom when he gets back and the part of me that is tired of him living off of us and spending his money on partying agrees with that. The other part of me feels really guilty for putting him out again and sending him to live with our crazy mom. 
I refuse to insert myself in his business and do everything for him but our mom makes it clear it's what she wants. I don't feel it is my place to demand that he involve me in his disability situation. I make it clear that I'll help with anything he needs but he is a grown man and I'm not going to make his choices, fill out his paperwork, and do everything for him. Especially because he says he doesn't need or want that. But I do want to see him get on his feet, live on his own, and get his shit together. At this point, I feel at my wits end. I don't know what to say to him, don't know how much longer I can put up with him sitting around all day while I bust my ass to pay bills.

Recently in the past day she's repeatedly talked about killing herself and how she would love to end her life -- this isnt the first time she's talked to me about it but i feel like it's more serious this time. She's depressed mainly because she doesn't think she can achieve what she wants to achieve in life (successful career in America, being beautiful, etc.) because uni is expensive, etc. I have offered my help (financial, emotional, etc) and assured her she can do it and I will support her, and that she's beautiful, etc. But I can't convince her, she won't believe me, and she often refuses my (financial) help even though I make well over 6 figures.

8986,cinzvj,TitaniumPenguin777,I’m now a homeless teen and on the verge of suicide,"This post is going to be extremely long so be warned.

I have been dealing with some serious mental health disorders my entire life, and my teenage years have just amplified them being just as awful. As a reaction to not being able to help me, my mother who I had lived with at the time admitted me to a mental hospital twice within two weeks and two weeks after I got out she physically assaulted me (she’s been abusive my entire life but it’s never been as bad as it was just then) and so I was taken out of her custody and into my fathers. The problem is that my father was abusive to me as a child and we just recently rekindled our relationship, so I somehow trusted him. He and his wife tried to “give me a good life”, which involved a lot of emotional abuse, but ultimately did get me some psychiatric help and therapy, which really helped. He knows I’ve been suicidal for the last two years but his wife didn’t care and she pushed me around like I wasn’t on the verge of ending it all or anything, and has made this a very emotional rollercoaster. My father ended up signing me up for an activity that I expressed interest in that would’ve lasted this whole summer, except I had no interest in the few weeks before he sent me off to it and I ended up not only having a severe nervous breakdown but I was also severely injured, so I wasn’t able to stay any longer. Both my father and his wife have expressed that they think I am at fault for wasting a lot of money and that I not only have to pay them back but I’ve over stayed my welcome and I needed to watch my back if I stayed there. The details behind everything are super long and twisting but since I’ve come back they’ve basically refused to feed me or help me pay for anything, and they’ve ceased my psychiatric help. I lived every day wanting to kill myself because my meds weren’t helping and they continuously treated me worse and worse. Today, I needed my fathers help to register for my senior year of high school band and we got to the school, and he threw a bunch of stuff at me mentally and I just couldn’t handle it so I told him to give me a minute. He then left me there while I was helping set up everything and refused to come back, blocked my phone number, and then texted my mother that I’m no longer staying with him. I’m currently sitting in a McDonalds trying to think of where I can go or what I can do to make enough money to afford band while crying profusely, and the worst part is that band is the only thing that gives me hope any more so if I can’t afford it then I’m going to end my life because I legitimately don’t live for anything else, and I had a job to support myself but now I don’t have access to it and my fathers stolen everything I’ve earned from there, so I can’t pay for anything. What should I do? I’m really close to walking in front of cars or doing something stupid because I feel so lost and used. I hope I don’t sound like a spoiled brat but I’m so hopeless right now and I’d rather die than live with either of my parents again.
TL;DR: both my parents have been abusive towards me and mixed with my mental health being severely poor has lead to me being kicked out of my house and on the verge of suicide.

Every girl I have encountered here are ok with it, some girls don’t like it but no one hates it as much as I do.

So getting back to my father, he has forced me to wear it, he doesn’t allow me to see my friends outside of university, he tracks everywhere I go, the only thing good he did for me is give me a room in his house and pay for my education, he pays for my food ( I will give him credit for that) 

Anyways I’m just gonna pour my heart out some things I’m going to say are not relevant but i just want to mainly vent, so yeah I decided a couple of days ago that I will stop taking his shit, I will take off the face veil and face him with what I want, he got furious, he chased me around the house trying to catch me so he would beat me on wanting to do something so out of social norms, he kept saying what will people say about me you bring me disgrace.

So as I said my father hates woman like he literally just tells me they are stupid and ignorant and men can manipulate them easily.

(Both 20 years old) We’ve been sexually active from the beginning, so it’s nothing new. He’s wonderful and we’re great friends but we are both in a rut at this point in life with little support from our families and trying so hard to get out of it. 

On sunday, after we had sex I started bawling. I have been feeling incredibly anxious and stressed and all around very very unwell but it had nothing to do with him or the sex. I genuinely do not know why I started crying or had a reaction like that immediately after. It was a like a switch and I couldn’t stop. He was very kind and understanding like always, but I can’t shake it off.

Right as I was leaving his house, his stepdad got home and yelled at him for something very aggressively and it caught me off guard and made me cry even more on the way home. He did not and does not ever deserve that when all he ever tries to do is love and support those around him. 

I don’t know how to not feel things so intensely. Whether it’s my emotions getting the best of me while being intimate or feeling so much for someone that them being yelled at scares me.

23483,9cpy4n,polygraphicmemory,How can I start getting excited about cooking again?,"I feel like I'm just running out of steam to cook new (to me) things and break my patterns. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't do fancy plating and advanced techniques but I'm pretty decent. I grew up in Alabama without a very culinarily inventive background (Puerto Rican and white) - PR at least has its flairs if you can access the ingredients but it's just nothing that screams flavor or complexity. The south has some really great food especially if you start going over to the delta, but eventually I had to start breaking out of I'd lose my mind because day to day. 

The menu you run into if you're not going to a creole place was just pretty repetitive and uninspired. I have so much love for southern done right but if your greens are bad and your fry is dry and your cornbread is breadcrumbs and your okra is slimy, there's only so much I can deal with. 

So I just started teaching myself and I've been cooking things for fifteen years on my own/since I was 15. (I was cooking before then but nothing particularly challenging). My main stable I cook now is Thai, Sichuan, S. Indian and Arab with the PR and southern classics thrown in. 

Problem is I just feel like I'm running out of steam in terms of what I'm willing to put work into. I get a little bored with my standards but I also just... am fucking tired at the end of the day and if I'm missing an ingredient I just don't have the energy to go out again even if I was excited about trying something new. It's a real demotivator. Anyone else go through this?"

I’m 16 male and my dad tells me ALL THE TIME that we are financially unstable and we need our mom to help pay off the loans for the house and cars and bills, and buy food and stuff. My dad always tells me that he can’t buy video games and stuff for me so I actually got a job secretly recently and I payed for my own games and I’m pretty proud about it. But my dad was furious and he said that I’m only 16 and shouldn’t have a job; it’s the parents’ job to pay for what I want. And I know he works hard but I wouldn’t want him to buy things for me if I know we are financially unstable. 
So
Every time I suggest to my mom to get a job she like acts all weird and is quiet and doesn’t talk and doesn’t look me in the eye and would immediately sit down and start eating food. I’m not sure why she does this.

4217,d7lzp2,kittenn11,Am I being over dramatic?,"I’ve always cared a lot about what people think of me. 


Just recently I was at my best friends 17th birthday party, a week prior a guy who is known as a bit of a ‘hoe’ or player posted saying that he wants a girlfriend. I had jokingly said to her “haha I’m gonna set you up with him” but I didn’t mean it at all... And she definitely knows that. I even said that I was joking but she proceeded to tell her boyfriend, and a day or two after she told me he hates me because of it.. I’m not sure why she couldn’t just tell him I’m joking herself.. but while they were on FaceTime I was about to say “hey @@@ just so you know I was joking. I respect you guys’ relationship and wouldnt seriously do something like that” so fast forward to her birthday party I notice him and her are very distant which was unusual for them considering the party but they tend to fight a lot so I wasn’t very surprised. Anyways, since she’s my best friend I was with her almost the entire party, it was also mainly her family and people I did not know so of course I stayed with her. But I noticed how they were acting so I asked her “why aren’t you guys talking? Is everything okay?” And she told me (not word for word but summed up as) “he’s mad at me because you’re here and he doesn’t like you because of what you said. I think he wants you to leave” so I asked if I should and she basically told me that she would prefer if I left so that he wouldn’t be mad at her and they could have sex.... so I ordered myself an Uber home directly after and left. 

Maybe I am just over dramatic and it wasn’t that serious, but that really hurt my feelings.. and I was honestly on the verge of tears on my way home. About 10 minutes after I got home she texted me “I’m sorry :((“ and I didn’t reply till an hour or so later because I don’t like texting when I’m emotional. I told her it was fine. But it isn’t.. she puts him way before me but I’m always there when she needs me! I was there every time she needed to cry or rant about him.. now I totally get that they’re in love but i personally wouldn’t treat her like that if it was reversed.."

Throwaway for very obvious reasons. A few years ago, someone hunted me down like a dog and stalked me for 6 months. 

Law Enforcement really dropped the ball. I had never felt more alone in my life than I did during that time.

They ignored me begging, never followed up etc and despite having pages of text, social media and phone call harassment, threats, attempting to get restraining orders, moving to another place, filing multiple police reports and dozens of calls and trips to the police station, he didn’t stop. 

The months of torture, threats to rape and kill me the harassment came to an end when he kicked my door in and I shot him in self defense.
He would play games like stop eating to drag out his court date and a year after the shooting he was finally sentenced, and given some credit for time served. 
He completed 4 years of the sentence, played nice and they paroled him. 

He contacted me yesterday. I actually don’t think this is the first time, I had started receiving blocked phone calls at 2 am a few days after his release from jail but had no way to prove it was him, I was afraid to reach out because of I did, it would confirm for him that he had found me. Well, he found me.

I tried calling the parole office and they said they released him from supervision less than a week ago. He was in jail for 4 years and waited less than a week before finding me despite having no social media.

They then gave me some BS about the only thing they can do is send me some pictures to give to my local law enforcement and pass around at work if I feel in danger.

I am freaking out because this feels like the same lack of help I received the first time. 

If this man kills me because this isn’t being taken seriously I pray that this doesn’t get buried. 
I don’t know what to do, I just really want to believe that more can be done to protect my life than faxing over pictures."
23608,9c5q4g,QutonicAtom,I’m thinking I need space from my parents.,"For the past several days, my parents have been getting into arguments. This really isn’t unusual for them, but it’s getting hard to ignore this time. Normally it will be a day or two, and then they make up. But this has been going on for a few days.

The arguments are always either about two things: something small that doesn’t really matter, or just a complete failure to communicate. Sometimes both.

Really, I don’t care if my parents get a divorce or not. I’m 18, almost 19. I’ll be fine, and I will still love them both. Really I just want them to be happy and no so negative.

Right now, they just seem so upset and negative all the time. I’m really worried it will effect there relationship, because I feel like I can’t be around them for to long, before they piss each other off.

It’s just frustrating being stuck in a house with two people who are going to yell at each other one or two times a day at random and odd times. It’s getting distracting and frustrating to deal with.

We have a guest house on our property, and I’m thinking about staying there for a few days if things stay how they are. I feel like I need to be away, so I can focus on school and my own life, while they figure things out.

Is that a bad idea? Should I tell them how I feel?"

Last night my father and I got into an argument where he grabbed me by the throat and then pinned me to the ground by my throat. I have had many issues like this through my life and my parents have never really left any marks on me. This has resulted in no action ever being taken since there are never any marks on me when I get cops or tell my school. Last night I called the cops on my dad and they sent me to my mom's house. She has been a lot less abusive the past year or so. I have a 34 on the ACT and go to a magnet school and am a senior in high school.

I got scared and asked our friend to call the police. He's now in the hospital, but he called me from the hospital (still drunk I think) very angry, asking me how I could do this to him and who am I to decide what he does, and that I should've let him do it.


He deleted my contact info last night and I feel awful and scared for him. How do I cope, and how do I support him as best I can? Our friend and I am traveling to the city he's in tomorrow. I don't know if I should reach out to him to say I'm here for him if he needs, what if he is still angry at me? He was very drunk last night so I don't know if he still feels the same way.


I can't focus on anything and I'm very anxious. It's difficult for me to feel like I did the right thing but I don't see what other options I had. How do I cope with this and how do I support him without being self-interested?"

Yes I acted okay, i was strong because my family needed me to be. But secretly, i started getting feelings I've never had before, feelings about death and fear of it. It doesn't help that my mom talks about how lonely she will be when me and my brother (going to same city as me). She talked about death too. 

The darkness is now something that scares me. Nightime feels like just another time where I can feel afraid. I feel so lonely at night and I think about this guilt i have of leaving my mom alone. Last night, I couldn't stop crying, even though im usually strong, i just couldn't break the feeling that i made a mistake. 

But I've wanted to study in Amsterdam for years. The only thing stopping me is this feeling with my mom. Should i tell my mom? Please guys, any advice or tips would be greatly appreciate.

He didn’t take that lightly, so he ended up hacking my Reddit account and holding it over my head while he interrogated me, posting my full name under my nude picture for everyone to see, contacting my ex and threatening to call the police on him, contacting my ex’s girlfriend and almost making them break up, contacting my sister relentlessly, contacted my brother and told him about everything, 

Made a fake account on Skype using my full name, my email address, and my photo and contacted me on there. Sent me 3 emails to different emails of mine, sent me one email saying he loved me and I hurt him, sent me another email the next day saying he didn’t love me and that he uses a program that tracks whenever I open his emails,

Added me on 3 different Instagram accounts of his, makes anonymous Instagram accounts to try to follow me, got his ex-girlfriend to try to follow me on Instagram, made 3 different Skype accounts and tried to contact me on there, 

And he’s harassing me and typing in my last name on social media and contacting anyone that’s remotely related to me and ruining everything I have and telling them all my personal details 

I called the Swedish police but they were useless and said it isn’t a crime to harass me for my photos, should I call them again and report him for stalking? Or would they not be able to do anything. 
I live in USA so it’s really hard to get him to stop stalking me

Should I contact the police and get him to track down his IP address so that they can forward that to the Swedish authorities to find a way to handle him?

I’m so scared he’s been terrorizing my life for over two months since I’ve blocked him, the most recent of his stalking being yesterday.

19955,aytslv,traurigaugen,Toxic living situation has reached breaking point please help.,"People complain about their roommates a lot, mine has made my life a living hell. 

Backstory: I live in an expensive town (unfortunately it is my hometown so I'd like to stay here) and found myself in a situation where roommates became a smarter decision. I found this couple that was signing a lease at a brand new apartment complex and it was in my price range. I met them, interviewed with them and felt comfortable enough to sign a lease with them. I didn't realize until the day of signing it was a 15 month lease but figured that'd give me enough time to get settled in and save some money for my next place.

The couple was 24F and 30M, both worked service industry at a successful restaurant and they had a dog who was seemingly taken care of and all was well. They weren't always the best at taking care of their dog which was annoying but overall I couldn't complain because nothing else was really bad. About 2.5 months into my lease the guy cheated on the girl and it set in motion the most messed up series of events I've ever endured. I tried to help because the girl didn't seem to know anyone as she moved to our town to be with him and they seemed to keep to themselves. That night I took her out to help her clear her mind and found out she was an insanely promiscuous person with no shame, I figured she did it because of what had happened but whatever it isn't my place to judge her life choices. After the night out she decided she wanted to work things out with him so for a week or so he slept on the couch and they'd bicker but over all it just seemed like normal relationship on the rocks kind of drama. Then one night the cops woke me up at about 2 am coming into my room saying that they were accusing each other of assault and asked me for witness testimony. I am a super hard sleeper, I honestly had no idea anything was going on until they barged into my room. I told them I barely know them but the guy drinks excessively and he had been drinking that night and the girl was sober to my knowledge. The guy ended up getting arrested and things all got very complicated. She had lost her job during the time he cheated on her (she blamed him but really just threw a hissy fit about going) and he continued to pay for everything at this time even when he wasn't legally allowed at the apartment. She had me convinced he was an abusive manipulator and yet she kept taking him back but I noticed how he'd always leave, etc. One of the nights he left I got a text message from someone claiming to be her mom asking me to check on her because she wasn't stable. I bang on her door, no answer, so when I figured she had left I turned around but saw her keys on the counter and decided to enter her room. I found her on her bed with her wrist slashed and open pill bottles on the floor. I call 911, she gets taken to the hospital and receives a psych eval and they said she was fine after a few days and sent her home. They continue to try to work on their relationship. 

She meets this sugar baby girl at her new job and instantly forms a very toxic relationship with her. She starts going out every night and partying (the guy was not at all about this) and the fighting becomes constant between them. He's never home because of her being insane, the dog isn't getting taken care of because of all of the craziness and at this point I had gotten my own dog and couldn't handle the responsibility of both as mine was very ill when I got her. They stay together through her slashing his tires (1 tire each time on 2 different occasions), her taking his wallet and stealing his car on multiple occasions, her ubering to a bar he was at with friends punching him, stealing his keys and leaving (at least once), her kicking in his windshield in front of his work, her stabbing him, breaking his TV and his computer monitor, etc. At this point I had realized that whenever this girls ""mom"" was texting her boyfriend or I it was actually her using a ghost number. All of this caused me to reach my breaking point one night and just let them both have it and explain that one of them needs to figure out who's staying and who's going because both of them being there was not healthy for anyone involved. They insisted they were going to work things out. I went along with it because now they were keeping their dog in the room and there weren't cops showing up every other week. 

Around Thanksgiving they had their last major battle and it ended with the guy being arrested for allegedly smearing dog shit all over her belongings and preventing her from leaving. Now she refuses to drop the charges on him and it's been months since he's lived with us. She told me she made enough money to keep the place on her own so she was planning on staying. The first month he was gone she refused to pay more than half of their portion because he ""owes it to her to pay one last month"". I'm stuck because all 3 of our names are on the lease and I can't make partial payments so I have to cover it with all this drama. As soon as he was gone she started partying every night or just overall being out every night and traveling. She left the dog for 3 days whe she went to Miami and if I wasn't there it would have starved, she insisted the person who was supposed to watch her bailed last minute and she was already gone. The dog would be crying and begging for attention every night and at first I didn't mind helping her out but it wasn't equal and I wasn't getting paid to do it and their dog is not only poorly trained but it's a Bernese Mountain Dog so it is a little bit much for me to handle by myself with my dog (I have a golden retriever). The dog is also so anxious from being left alone all the time it has destroyed some of my things and lashed out at my dog. The animal has always pooped and peed everywhere, literally does not understand how to hold it and she doesn't take it out nearly enough.

I've lost cookware, food, hair brushes, paper towels, cleaning products, and she still owes me over $1k and I can't even live in my own home because of the smell of dog poop and pee...

She left the dog alone again last night so I told the guy he needs to come get her (it is legally his dog) or I'm calling animal services because that dog needs help. She posts adorable pictures and videos on her Instagram of how amazing this dogs life is and that's literally a rare occasion that she is even giving it attention. She decided she wanted to keep it from him since he ""took so much from her"". He has been too scared to get the dog back because of legal ramifications and since after all the craziness she's done to him he's the one going through the court system and being blamed for things he didn't do. She refuses to drop the charges because she wants to be a martyr and save people from this monster she has made up in her head. The girl is legitimately insane and a compulsive (possibly pathological) liar. She cannot be spoken to like an actual adult. The other night her dog made a mess as it usually does and when she got home she just took the dog in her room and ignored the mess. I texted her 15 minutes later figuring that maybe she was just changing out of her work clothes and she literally didn't clean up the mess for at least hours so I went somewhere else to sleep. I can't keep cleaning up her messes, it's disgusting and unfair. The noise and smell this dog creates because of her has made us receive multiple notices for compliance / pre eviction letters. 

So after all of this, my breaking point has been this: I set up a camera in my room because I wanted to check on my dog while I am at work and also wanted to make sure that her crazy ass wasn't snooping though my stuff when I wasn't staying there. I went to review some footage this mornjng as I just got home last night after staying somewhere else for a week because I wanted to get away from her. I realize that yesterday morning she came into my room naked and looked for my vibrator, when she didn't find it where it used to be she continued to walk into my room until she saw it. She then took it and used it (still in my room) and put it back.

The fact that she knew where I used to keep it tells me this was not the first time. I need to get as far away from this place as possible or get her removed.

For legal reasons, I'm in Florida and we are all on the lease. The guy has an order of protection preventing him from coming back. 

I can't afford to break my lease under normal circumstances, it will literally cost me more than staying and on top of that now owing money back for all of the damage that her dog has caused to the apartment. I can't afford another place to live right now because of this whole situation either and I just really don't know what to do. Now I feel violated and taken advantage of to the point where I just don't know what to do. I feel broken as a person and I need some direct help with dealing with this. 

TLDR;
My insane roommate doesn't take care of her dog making my apartment unlivable and has now come into my room and used my vibrator (all caught on camera). I need help. "
35619,7vux5t,FrequentTop,My father passed away a few days ago and I need help knowing if I am fully internalizing it.,"The whole situation is a long story but it was inevitable and he was dealing with an illness. He was very calm and happy about it and we're happy that he is at peace and no longer in pain. I'm 17 and haven't dealt with a loss in my family before.  
However, it's easy to just say in your head that your dad died and that you understand it, but here there I feel like I haven't really accepted it and here are the reasons why I'm suspicious.  

* I've only cried a couple of times and only for a couple minutes, but I know crying doesn't represent what you understand but it feels kinda strange. Instead I get a sad feeling in my belly and sigh.  

* I find his everyday items and they kinda make me tear up a bit and I could let out a cry but it feels like it doesn't have enough force to make me.  

* Imagining things like touching his chest and not feeling his heartbeat feels kinda logical but I have a feeling it would scare me yet it doesn't align with my understanding. I don't really believe the body that is laying somewhere is my dad anymore, but just some place where his consciousness laid yet you recognize people by their face.

* Sometimes I talk about him in the present tense and it makes me feel like I subconsciously haven't accepted he's gone but it's most likely just be getting used to it.  

My father was probably my favorite person and my brother and I were his favorite things in life but he worked very often and on weekdays I hardly saw him. However I feel like he would've been weirded out if I sat there and stared at him because he was a very rational person who believed you should be busy all the time and focusing on things that interest you. Obviously I haven't started missing him yet but I just wanna know if I am accepting his loss correctly. Tomorrow is his funeral and I'm sure I'll be pretty normal and having laughs here and there. My mind is still kinda blurry though. He didn't want us to worry or cry about him being gone. He wanted us to go have fun and live our lives. We also knew he was ill for 2-3 ish years and this last month he was very frail and acting different due to illness. Any help or advice is appreciated. I wanna hear stories from others also, thanks."

18075,b9de4m,Wild_Daisies,Continuing to get bullied at work. What do I do now?,"Sorry for the long post. TL:DR- being continuously talked down to/ reported by the same doctor. I reported the issue to my boss, and things continue to worsen. What do I do now?

I'm a nurse in a large hospital. I've been a nurse for 5 years. I recently changed specialties and went to a unit that has both medical and surgical doctors. 

For the past few months, I've had issues with one the medical doctors. The first incident happened while I was orientation and made a mistake because I misunderstood the way this unit does things. It wasn't anything major, but this doctor went right to my boss and tried to get me written up.

Since this incident, whenever I have a patient under the medical doctors they get very snippy with me. They talk down to me, or will get agitated if I bring a patient-related concern to their attention.

We had a patient that had a dressing over a wound. It was draining quite a bit of fluids,it was at the point that I needed to change the dressing a few times during my shift. Towards the end of my day, the doctor came in while the family was there and said to me ""Did you even *bother* to change this dressing today? Look at the state of it!"" I was so embarrassed with 1) the way he spoke to me 2) the fact he said it in front of the family and 3) the fact that he thinks I would ignore something like that. 

When we were outside the room, I told him that it was completely inappropriate the way he spoke to me in front of the family and the asshole just laughed it off. 

So I brought the issue to my manager. I am sick of this occurring, we are not in highschool. We're freaking adults. 

Come to find out from my manager, he has reported me 4 other times since I started. I asked her what they were about, and she said that she couldn't even remember because they were petty issues. 

I came back for me 2nd shift in a row, and find out that the medical patients were taken from me, and I was given surgical patients. When I asked why my patient assignment changed, I wasn't really given an answer. I suspect that the medical team requested to have a different nurse assigned to the patients.

Things just seem to have escalated since reporting this issue. Now we get to the part where I may just be being sensitive, but medical team ignores me if I were to say ""good morning"" to them. 

 Does anyone have any advice on what to do now? I starting to think I should find a new job to avoid this.

27498,8rq8k8,sam13324,How do I live down this humiliation?,"I’m a 17M and I was on a school boating trip. We were to bring lunch and a change of clothes incase we fell in as well as a towel. When we arrived we put our bags with our towels, clothes and lunches in them down and we got put into groups and I managed to get into my crush’s group. I was the only guy in the group because the female to male ratio in my class  is about 1.5 to 1. There were 7 people on the boat in total. There was An instructor (F), Rebecca (my crush), Erin, Ashley, Katie, Some girl I don’t know the name of and Me. I sat next to Rebecca.

The instructor drove us out far into the sea where it would be safe for her to let us drive. Erin began to drive and it was actually pretty fun. Our boat tipped and we got absolutely soaked so we drove back to change. When we got there I realised I had left my bag on the bus we came on. The instructor told me I would get sick if I didn’t take of the wet clothes so I reluctantly did. We couldn’t go back out because we had no back up clothes so we had to wait till the other groups finished (30mins!) the instructor went into a hut and left us on the beach. we sat on the beach and just messed around. They wouldn’t stop laughing and joking about me being completely naked. I tried to cover myself with my hands but after a while it just got annoying so I just stood there fully exposed. They weren’t being mean or anything they just couldn’t help it. This was embarrassing but nothing could prepare me for what happened next. When the class got back  another bus came to pick us up. I had to take an hour long bus journey naked! Then when we got back to school i was supposed to walk home but couldn’t because I was naked. A girl in my class Ashley gave me a lift. It was only five minutes but it felt like 5 years. Picture this... Ashley’s mom, Ashley’s twin sister Emily and Ashley all sitting in a car with me completely naked trying to make small talk.

Not my proudest moment.

I go back to school on Monday and don’t think I can face anyone. Help"

I told her that my friend Casper’s mom gives him tea but he doesn’t like it so he gives it to me. She took it out of my hand and opened it and smelled it and then she said I’ll be keeping this. Then she went to her teacher friends and told them and said it seems fishy and that she will call my parents about this. And she gave me 2 detentions as well. WTF??!!

15527,bmk50x,1506892,Failed course,"Hi guys! So I need some advice on what to do/say in this situation. Backstory: I’m in an accelerated masters program that allows me to take grad classes and it counts to both my undergrad and grad program. I took 5 classes (3 undergrad, 2 grad), and had a full time job for the first time in my life last year. 

In the mean time I was depressed and barely hanging on. I felt overwhelmed, tired, sick, and just like I wanted to give up everything but I kept going. Ended up with an F on one of my grad classes. 

This year I’m taking medication (anti-depressants) and feel myself again. This is year two and the rest of my grad classes have been straight A’s. My grades for undergrad is around the B/C area. 

My current situation: I am retaking that failed grade and asked for it to be wiped from my transcript. They said unless extenuating circumstances and I can offer a life event that led to this failure they will not let me retake it for the final grade. 

What do you guys think I should say/do? This is the first time I ever feel motivated in school and want to prove myself. I didn’t care up until now and i want to prove to myself I CAN be a school person. I’m worried mental health isn’t a strong enough reason. 

TLDR:  I failed a course and they need me to give them a reason why. What should I say?"
29393,8hhhxf,MasterReeeee,"(19,M) First Sexual Experience is Haunting Me","TL;DR At the bottom. My first girlfriend wasn’t a very sexual person and both of our first times with each other reflected that.  On top of this she was so nervous, as was I. She couldn’t “open up” enough because of it and although I tried to be accommodating, we were both inexperienced. After dating and waiting for two years we simply couldn’t have sex for months. It tore us both apart. I have vivid images of her, naked, straight up crying as I was on top of her (both from pain and feelings of inadequacy on her part.) of course I stopped. I get off on others pleasure and seeing her cry was the last thing I wanted. 
Finally, in the third and final year of our relationship, we started having actual sex, not pain.
During this year we had some really fun sex. However, in all the three years we dated she never let me make her come. She never even came for herself masturbating. She was scared of it. I would try and try and when she would get close she would push me off or take my hand off. It was so frustrating. 
I asked her what the penetrative part of sex felt like for her. “like nothing. Just like I’m being fucked but that’s about it. ”....nothing? I’m not a mamba but I’m decently average. “Rubbing the clit feels better.” I asked if she enjoyed it and she said yes, being fucked and rubbed felt really good. 
One of our friends was asking sex questions. In response my girl said something along the lines of “oh, well Op can’t go a week without sex, but it doesn’t really matter as much to me. I don’t even think I need it.” I tried to keep my head up through everything but that comment nearly sealed the deal in destroying my confidence. She backtracked it and said she didn’t mean it. Still hurt. Still hurts. Upon reflection it’s clear that this is probably the worst sexual experience I will have and it’s so far my only penetration experience. 

We broke up around 8 months ago. In that time I have been with 3 girls. The first girl didn’t want sex but went crazy for dry humping. She moaned loud as hell. The second girl came on my face (first time I did that.) The third girl, my current girlfriend, came on my Hand. 

TL;DR: As I approach my second penetrative sex experience, I still cannot shake my feelings of inadequacy from my first relationship, despite evidence to the contrary. How can I overcome this?

8112,cmterg,Toot_Toot_Toot93,How to feel clean after living in an unsanitary household,"Growing up, my parents never kept a clean house. It was always referred to as ""the barn"" by friends and family with a tone of mixed humor and disgust due to the overwhelming mess that was always present. The stench of cigarette smoke and animal urine coated every surface with a layer of grime that ensured you would never feel truly sanitary as long as you stayed. 

Once I grew old enough to understand that the situation I lived in wasn't normal, I did everything I could to keep things clean and sanitary. It was a continuously uphill battle, with no signs of it ever getting easier. My parents aknowledged the state of our house for the mess that it was, but never made the efforts to change their behaviors that caused it to get that bad in the first place. 

I've since moved away for school, and have replaced  everything that I had when I lived with my parents. I keep my current place clean and tidy, and make sure to maintain good hygiene. But I still feel dirty. Im always worried that I smell bad, or that I look unclean. I still feel the need to wash my clothes the night before I want to wear them even if they're already clean, and that I can't go outside if I haven't showered beforehand even if I showered earlier that day.

I know it's illogical to act as if I'm still in the same environment that I lived in as a kid, but I can't seem to break these habits and convince myself that I keep things clean enough. I feel like I still need to go above and beyond normal cleanliness standards to appear normal and clean around others. How can I convince myself that I'm doing enough, and that I don't have to live the way I used to?"

It may be totally unrelated, but lately, I also have a hard time saying what I want to say. Sometime, it's because the words just won't come out of my mouth (example, I want to say to my coworker that I'm about to do a certain task, but even though what task I want to do, I'm just unable to say it out loud, sometimes it takes almost a full minute to finally say the single word I was trying to say)

Other time, it's because I have sudden memory blank. Yesterday, me and my coworker (not the one I snapped at, another one) were talking about movies, and I couldn't remember the name of my favourite actresses, despite having watched a movie featuring them less than a week prior)

8952,cit1cw,Diddery-,I Feel Like I’m Being Manipulated,"I’m going to try to keep this summary as brief as I can. 
Been friends with this one person for about three years now. But by this point in time, our friendship has dwindled down to a lot of arguing. I’ll proceed to list at the signs I’ve gotten as to whether I’m being manipulated or not. 
Side note, this relationship is carried out through a messaging app, and the person in question has issues.

Often times, I feel treated unfairly. Just recently, this person got mad at me for not responding for 24 hours, in which I apologized and tried to clarify things. But not too long before that, they had completely disappeared on me for about 2-3 weeks. With their return though, they never explained anything, nor apologized. 
This isn’t even the first instance of this happening. 

Whenever I try to detach myself from our toxic relationship, it either leads to them: guilting, shaming, or threatening me. 
Sometimes even all at once. 
The worst case being when they mention killing themselves. 

Whenever I speak up and note that I feel unfairly treated, this leads to them talking about themselves and how much of a hard life they have. 

I can go on, but I fear for reaching the letter limit to these posts, so feel free to ask me to elaborate down below. I apologize if this is not enough to work with.
Anyways, I just need to know. Am I being manipulated? Is there something I can do to take care of this?"

Like it started out as just 1-2 times a week,but now it's gotten to the point where I'm probably eating fast food 5-7 times a week, almost once a day. Sometimes I'll eat it twice a day. I've gained quite a bit weight in the last few months as well, though the scales say I weigh the same I feel that's a lie. I can clearly tell my stomach has gotten much rounder. I was already somewhat heavy, but now it's gotten worse. It's like I just love the greasy taste of fast food. I love Taco Bell, Mcdonalds, Burger King, Sonic, etc. I'll get hungry in the morning and just crave McDonalds breakfast, or like for lunch I'll want a burger. It's really just escalated into full blown addiction. Really my biggest concerns are my weight and my health. I'm 26 years old, but I'm about 30 lbs overweight and I'm just afraid if I keep eating like this I'll just keep putting on the weight, plus I'm worried about my health. So many things are linked to obesity. Things like high blood pressure, diabetes, joint pain, shortness of breath, heart attacks, etc. It's also really bad to gain so much weight in such a short amount of time. The scales say I haven't gained anything substantially but when I look in the mirror I can tell I've put on a lot more body fat, not sure how that works. I do know that eating fast food at the rate I'm eating it is super unhealthy. 1-2 times a week might be manageable, but 5-7 times a week is ridiculous. I know it's an addiction because it's like I can't control myself. I have a big appetite and I'll order a lot of food to feel sated/full. I really let myself go as well.

This girl, we'll call her Ruby, has a few mental health disorders, and can get INCREDIBLY depressed. My sister was there for her during a few of her episodes, which served to solidify their 'bond'.

 At first I assumed everything was fine. They got along well and seemed to have a lot of fun. But as time went on, things started to get kind of weird. If my sister went somewhere without Ruby, Ruby would find out and get mad. If my sister didn't talk to her for a day, Ruby would spam her phone and ask why she didn't care anymore.

A few times, my sister asked her to calm down and talk through it, but this prompted Ruby to threaten suicide. I feel like it's getting worse, and I don't know what to do. From my perspective, Ruby is just a kid who I don't want to get hurt, but I also want to look out for my sister.

The most recent turn of events has Ruby acting like they're a couple. Now, my sister has a stable relationship with her boyfriend, and they plan on getting married. When she told Ruby this, the response she got was 'Have you even considered what /I/ might want in the future?'
And... yikes. I just don't know what I can do.

16303,bivo6q,forkslice,Would you be friends with a rapist or murderer?,"I’m just thinking about it because to be honest I don’t know how to classify morality anymore. Maybe I’m seeing things in just black and white, but I’ve been trying to remind myself that everything is gray and morality is man made. Like for example, we have issues with the correlations between God, tragedies such as the Holocaust or slavery, and religion’s concepts. 

A person who I share a hopefully mutual bond with is friends with people who are morally out of the social norm, and is okay with any wrongdoings if they were judged because he benefits from them somehow (he finds them funny). And it made me realize that it applies to our current times. We have a lot of celebrities doing things that, if affected someone close to us that we care about, we would seek revenge in some form. But those celebrities get away with it because of the things they provide, especially if it’s an art form that can be consumed.

Meanwhile I have another friend who has stated he knows of people who kill other people for fun. To live a lifestyle like that, as in to be involved with people like those mentioned, I think you would have to be careful with that. It’s hard to describe but it’s similar to close but not too close.

I get anxious thinking about if people who have done wrongdoings deserve to be accepted by the world. I feel that people with certain negative traits are not to be accepted, but because they are human, they get a pass. But by being friends with or associating with people like that, unless you’ve bonded with them only for beneficial purposes, puts the person in the wrong with them. If Person A harms Person B, and Person C finds out what Person A did and is still friends with them, that would be just like enabling Person A. It’s like those cases of frat guys who rape people on college campuses.

But the issue is when you’re a person who’s done a wrongdoing and “passing off” as normal to everyone else. And that is something that deserves to be accepted with love and forgiveness, but that is also weakness taking form.

It’s difficult because people who have done wrong were people before what happened. There are multiple lifestyles to choose from and all of them have their thoughts and opinions. If a person abuses an animal, do they have a right to advocate against it in the future? Them advocating against it won’t change the fact that they’re as bad a person as the people whose side they aren’t on. It negatively impacts victims of certain scenarios. It’s like a snowball that starts from enabling and becomes something else. 

People are temporary but it’s emotionally confusing. I don’t know if eye for an eye is justifiable. It’s like a weird thing but this is all from the scenario of a “secret” abuser being romantically attached to an actual abuser. Meanwhile for everything I’ve just stated, there are people who send love letters to rapists and murderers in prison. I’m honestly surprised I’m not dead yet"
5910,cykzog,Jewpracabra,How do I tell my roommate I'm getting my own place?,"It's a last minute decision, but I'm like 98% sure I'm going to go through with it. The 2% being that I'm not sure if the place we're currently applying for has 1 bedroom units available. We move out our current place this month.

Recently my roommate started dating someone and any time she's here it's like I'm a guest, or at least that's how I feel. I don't like it and I don't think I could potentially do a year of them playing house. I'm pretty sure she has a key to our current place, which is not okay. I don't know her. We've said maybe three words to each other. My roommate and I have been friends for a few years and I don't want us to stop talking because I want my own place. The thing is, this being so last minute he'll ask why and I'm not sure if I should be honest or just avoid the question."

6459,cv7ffx,indiewitchx,Flatmate nightmare,"I need some advice.

My flat mate has been a friend of mine since high school. We aren’t extremely close but in the same friend circle and we of course, live together.

She has some bad hygiene habits. 

She has a habit of doing her laundry and leaving it in the tub and not touching it again for days and a few times, weeks. My partner and I went on holiday for a night and when we came home she had wet washing in the tub, since I needed to do laundry I took her stuff out and placed it in her basket, next to her other basket full with damp clothes. so that’s two baskets of clothes! She leaves this in the laundry for 6days. 

Last night I moved it into the hallway while I was vacuuming and mopping the laundry floor. She came out of her room and grabbed her damp washing and went into her room and hung them up to dry 😩

The hallway and her side of the house now smells absolutely disgusting. The smell of damp washing. 

I don’t know how to approach her about this? She is my friend and I don’t want to embarrass her but this is my house and she shouldn’t be drying her clothes in there because it will make my house damp but also hanging up 6day old washing and stink up my house at the same time ?

Has anyone else had something similar happen? 

Advice please!"

I dont have a problem gaining weight just build mass on my ARMS (I have a very good high calorie diet and see gains everywhere but arms), the rest of my body grows just fine, not my arms? I can gain strength in them, in fact I recently raised my curl and chin up max (27.5lb curl) (7 chin ups). But size is an issue. I hate it because my arms look completely disproportionate to the rest of my body and I obsess about 24/7. So to anyone who has been in this position how do I fix it???"
26745,8vsqty,theTruthrowaway,Wife always has a reason to not have sex and Im not sure what to do,"We've been married for about a year and a half.  We agreed not to have sex before marriage. Both of us were virgins. But we still had heavy make out sessions and several times almost had sex. But as soon as she started her birth control all the passion seemed to go away. She still wanted me but she was almost never horny and if she was it was always at an inconvenient time (I was asleep or I was at work). So we got her off the birth control and switched to a better non-hormonal one. 

She also has a few allergies and we found out part of the pain she experienced almost everytime we had sex was from her being allergic to the lube we were using. So we switched that to coconut oil which has worked really well. 

About 6 or 7 months in I was in the habit of rolling over after we went to bed hoping to start something and almost everytime it would end with either me giving her a massage and not having sex or just us not having sex. We tried to discuss it without any kind of argument and it usually ended in tears about her thinking she was a disappointing wife. She asked me to stop propositioning every night (I admit I thought it wasn't every night but I think in my mind I wouldn't count nights where I tried and failed as an attempt at all) and that if I just let her decide then shed feel more in the mood. I agreed and the small amount of sex we were having stopped for about a month. She never initiated it. Maybe shed give me a handjob but it stoped feeling like she was giving me one out of love and more like it was a chore. 

It clearly hasn't been working but talking about sex gets us nowhere because as a child her asshole grandfather told her that no man would ever love her if she didn't give them what they really wanted. So talking to her feels like Im admitting he was right. Which I love her more than anything, shes my best friend and I hate that I want sex this bad and that it usually hurts her. I thought maybe if I fingered her more often it might help her so it doesn't hurt as much but maybe I do like once or twice but she always comes up with a reason that we can't. 

Weve gone to the doctor but for some reason every doctor weve been to has been an uncaring ass that treats her like shit when she starts talking about the problems weve been having. Like they dont care. We even had one doctor ask her a few questions then when she had to call me about a birth control option the doctor was like ""ok well Ill be back in a few minutes to see what you decided."" she then left for lunch and then charged us $100 for an exam that never actually happened (We talked to the hospital and got it sorted out). 

As for recently in May we had sex early in the month and didnt have any until june 10th. But June 10th only happened because I was so frustrated that I thought maybe something special would get her more in the mood so I planned a special day in the city ending with a night at a couples hotel. Where we had sex 1 time. We haven't have sex after that. 

Last week thursday I tried to start something because saturday early morning we were going on a weekend vacation with her folks but she was just ending a pretty bad cold. So she promised that the next day wed have sex. So friday when Im at work she sent me some sexy texts. I go home and shes asleep so I let her sleep so shes not tired. Soon she comes out half naked and I try and start it but she wants to eat and shower. She eats but notably doesn't shower. We were helping dome friends move and I thought wed have sex before we went over to help, nope. But she says itll only bee an hour then well come back home and have sex. We go and it takes 5 hours. The first hour is actually helping them pack up the truck, then Im sent on an errand to pick up a special dog food while she goes to see their new house. After that Im told to meet at their old house for dinner where we just keep talking on and on. Finally we run one last errand to the grocery store. We get home and in the car in front of our house I try to start something and she wants to go inside. We do but she says how about after we clean the house and do out chores because we have someone staying to watch the dogs till monday (yesterday). So we do the chores and its about 8, I have 1 more errand to run and she says she will shower and get ready while Im gone. I get back at 9 and she is ready we start making out aaaaaaannnnnnndddddd she notices I didn't put a box of beer glasses back on top of the fridge. A 5 second fix. But it takes her so out of the mood that as were laying there trying she starts talking about random very unsexy things. Its like nothing I do is helping her get into the mood but literally anything will take her out of the mood. So I go to sleep pretty pissed off and then we go on vacation which calmed me down.

So yesterday I knew what our schedule will be I had to drive the 5 hours home, wed have an hour then Id have to go into work, but after work shed be doing some art thing with my family which when she gets home for shes going to want to go to bed because she works at night. So I tried to get her turned on a little in the car and we get home start making out aaaaaaaannnnnnnnnddddddddd her stomach feels nauseous and shes really tired. But she'll rest up and take some tums to calm her stomach so after art night we can have sex. And of course she texts me before I get home from work that her stomach still hurts and shes still really tired just to make sure I don't start anything and get disappointed when I get home. 

Its been just over 20 days but if we dont have sex today or tomorrow which I think is highly likely thursday were going on another vacation thing and staying with some friends till sunday, so no sex then. But she hasnt had her period lately so it'll likely start this weekend. So Im looking at the 14th or 15th till we can conceivably actually have sex. 

I feel terrible because I dont want to hurt her. I dont want her to feel like shes a disappointment because frankly shes not. I love everything about her and I love spending non-sexual time with her. That 5 hour drive was so easy just talking to her about anything, and days are always like that. And her reasons for not having sex are always legitimate. I wouldn't want to have sex if I felt sick, and there are chores that do always need to be done. But sometimes it feels like even if everything is going perfectly she is searching for a reason to not have sex. But the only solution I can think of for the pain is more sex. Because it seems in months where we have sex more than twice or I finger her more often it doesn't seem to hurt as much. 

I hate being such a bad husband and I feel horrible that I making such a big deal out of this. I feel like it shouldn't be and that I should be more supportive especially since there's usually a good reason but it just feels like there is always a reason and that its ok to put it off. I dont know what to do. 

Sorry for the long post and if it got to be a bit of a rant there. Im just trying to give a good amount of information. "
29222,8if4gx,ykwchickenthigh,"My mother is always trying to ""help"" me...","Hey there,

I have this issue with my mom and I'm seeking some advice or opinions. I'm approaching 30 years old, married, and have kids and a house of my own. Over my adult life I've never asked my mom for financial help (until recently), and have asked for help with other things on a minimal basis. I'm a self sufficient person and my husband and I are doing well both financially and in life in general. We did recently take a personal loan from my mother to help with a down payment on a house, but we'll have her paid back within a year. It was a one time thing.

My mother is driving me crazy. Any time I try to talk to her about anything, she gives me unsolicited input. Any time I mention the cost of something, she asks me if I'm ok and if we need help with money. She has twice this year tried to insist on paying for services I do not want or need; a moving company when we moved to our house, and a year of housekeeping as a Christmas gift. For both of those things I made it clear I wasn't comfortable with it and felt it was very unnecessary, but she pushed anyways. My answer was still no... She didn't like that.

She's honestly making me uncomfortable, and I'm starting to get mad when she does this, but I don't know what to say to her. I know that if I try to describe why it bothers me, I look like the bad guy because she's just trying to help or is being generous. But it makes me feel like she thinks I'm incompetent, or doesn't respect that I am an adult fully capable of making my own decisions and handling my affairs. I feel like she's treating me like a child or an inexperienced young adult. I'm getting to the point where I hesitate to talk to my mom about anything ever because of how she responds. 

What do you think? How should I handle it? Am I being ungrateful and unnecessarily defensive?"

176,ejeeo3,-keep-it-a-secret-,"How do I (19F) let a guy (20M) I’ve known for a while that I do indeed like him, but that I’m scared of change and being uncomfortable?","The title may seem odd, and if it is then I apologize. I’ve known this guy since elementary school, but we really started being friends in middle school. We went to different high schools but we stayed in contact via text. Last year we texted a lot in the beginning of the year (we texted everyday) but slowly stopped towards the middle. It was my fault as I am the sort of the person who doesn’t feel like they need, or want to, text a person everyday because sometimes I don’t want to talk or I just don’t have anything new to say. 

Last year, when we were still talking, this guy told me he liked me and wanted to see if I wanted to get to know each other more, and I said I liked him too. I did like him at the time, and I still do. We’ve gone to three movies, had lunch/dinner twice, and got ice cream. 

We continued to talk until our conversations via text fizzled out. It’s the beginning of a new year and I feel guilty. I don’t want him to think that I led him on or anything. The reason why I failed to keep conversation going is because I’m scared. If getting to know each other were to have worked out, and we began to date, it would have been my first relationship. I’ve never kissed anyone and I just keep thinking to what all/most relationships require. By that I mean sexual things (if we were to make it that far into the relationship for things to lead to that as I’ve never had sex before either). I’m scared of being uncomfortable, and I’m scared of change. 

This guy and I are still cordial, and I don’t feel like we have any bad blood or anything like that. At this point, I don’t mind if we don’t move forward and see where things went. If he’s moved on then that wouldn’t hurt my feelings. I more so just want him to have answers. I just want to be able to let him know that it was because of me that we stopped talking and not anything he did. Is it a bad/weird idea if I were to text him and tell him that I’ve been thinking lately about things and would like to talk to him about it? I would tell him pretty much what I wrote in the text post. I just don’t know if that’s just too bizarre to come out of nowhere with all of what I just wrote."
13397,bwladb,Justinsthrowaway85,My Boyfriend is dealing with depression and I don't know how to help,"Sorry if this seems rambly, I keep rewording it and I'm not sure how to word it/what to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess to start out with for background info, my boyfriend is HIV+, he's known about it for several years, he's on medicine/as healthy as you can be, but it's probably the root of his issues.  He's struggled with depression in the past, and has good weeks and bad weeks.  A month ago or so he came out about his status to a ""friend"" that he was getting closer to and that friend basically cut him off completely, that sent him in a downward spiral and he's been that way since.  I try to be as encouraging as I can, but he absolutely refuses to go see a mental health counselor and honestly I don't know how to respond when he talks about himself using words like dirty/tainted or says he feels like he's ""screaming in silence"".  Does anyone have any advice on books/articles I could read that could help me out with the best way to help him?  I honestly don't know what I should be doing or how to help."
9541,cg19d5,SadisticSienna,Live with my boyfriend but he spends 95% of his time gaming and doesn't spend much time with me,"So we moved in together about 2-3months ago into a large granny flat.

I have realized he spends pretty much all his time gaming. We do nothing together in the house except eat and even then he seems distracted. When we go out to dinner he often will look at his phone through most of it. 

When we are at home he goes straight to his computer and games and comes and says hi to me every few hours then goes straight back to gaming. He doesn't chat with me much or hang out with me at home, he just games 95+% of the time.

Then he goes to work and I'm back on my own alone again at home.

We don't seem to have many similar hobbies ie I like aquariums and Im more outdoorsy and he has a huge friend circle and likes various pc games and yughioh which I have no idea about.

Im starting to feel lonely and depressed. I've started taking antidepressants but I just feel kinda ignored most of the time. It feels like I bore him and if we arent doing a full activity he doesnt want to spend time with me doing nothing for long periods of time.

I thought we should play some type of card game or something together but havent thought of one so far. I asked him to look into it. Since i have been depressed and now have to study for a final exam.

We went on a walk together days ago to mcdonalds but thats 1 day in all the rest. It doesn't help how he just doesnt spend much time with me at home and the pc addiction is bugging me. Feels like he cares about his friends more than me because he spends more time with them."
12938,bysodm,KingAetherrr,I [18M] find it extremely hard to do things that I NEED to be doing,"I'm gonna start this off by saying I believe I have depression but I've never talked to a therapist/gotten an actual diagnosis.

So I'm 18, just graduated high school and have been in summer break for a few days now. I don't have a job. I still haven't taken my permit test or even been in the driver seat of a car. I even have trouble doing the bare minimum like showering, getting dressed daily, brushing teeth, etc. every day. Instead I'll browse Reddit, watch Youtube or distract myself with videogames until I go to sleep and do the same thing all over again the next day. I haven't even finished completing important financial aid forms I need to begin picking classes in college. This past year my grades slipped significantly for the first time due to procrastination or me just straight up not doing assignments. The thing is, I really do need to be doing these things but I just don't? It's hard to explain, I know why I need to stop procrastinating and ""get my act together"" but when the time comes to do said acts I just push it off for another time. I even promised my favorite teacher I'd try and learn programming over summer but I haven't even done anything related to programming (my passion) for months now. I made this post in some effort to ""fix"" myself before another summer is done and gone, hopefully other people were in a similar situation and can help me out?"
15493,bmpngm,ZachTheApathetic,Dont know what to do with my career since I hate my degree,"I live in the US (west coast). Graduated with a BS in computer engineering. 

A couple years ago I had a mental breakdown during finals on one of my later semesters in college, I was stressed out of my mind and not enjoying the work at all anymore, seriously questioning if I wanted to do this. for the rest of my life. 
I pushed through anyways being so close to the finish, graduated and got my first job. I was bright and hopeful thinking working would bring a new light and reignite my interest in engineering. I chalked up my breakdown to high stress and difficult classes. I figured finishing my degree and then getting my first job would open doors of opportunity and interest.

I was wrong, my first job has instead been the nail in the coffin for my interest in engineering.

On paper it's a fabtastic job. I'm actually locked in to 40 hours a week, no more, no less. The pay is a bit less than average, but the work environment is friendly and my supervisor very helpful and my actual hours are very flexible. 

Problem is I loathe the subject matter. I'm sick of working with code and bits and boards and resistors... I can't have 0 interest in any of it anymore. Another part of the problem is I cant stand sitting at the same desk staring as the same screen for 8 hours a day.

So my question is: Where can I go from here? I have a degree in a subject that I basically want nothing to do with but I don't want it to go to waste... I just dont know how to go about figuring out what Im going to do with the rest of my life. Is there something I can do that allows me to get out and about and not staring at a screen all day?

33842,81x0vu,starlingsss,My dad keeps “accidentally” opening doors on me,"I’m 19, male, I live at home, skipped one year after high school to have a gap year, now I’m re-doing some of my final exams in may, to get into a better university. 

It’s been going on for years, but I just can’t take this anymore, I can hardly concentrate on my studies with all this shit he keeps throwing at me. We have shouting sessions pretty much every day (or I avoid him completely), the latest thing was that he can’t remember his passwords to his phone, and the one I remembered was changed at some point, obviously have to take it out on me very vocally. Whatever the fuck he finds to blame someone else with, he’s never taken responsibility for ANYTHING in his life. 

This is the light stuff, I’m sure this problem is pretty common. 

But he likes to do a few things that I’ve just had enough of for good. For example, eavesdropping on any conversation, especially when I’m with my grandpa(he practically raised me, he’s super jealous of him), it’s not hard since they live in the house next to us. And the door thing. He probably has a big thing for seeing stuff he shouldn’t see, 
when I’m on the toilet, a LOT of times when I’m in the toilet, practically every time I take a shit I keep grasping on the door handle, and wait for him to open(never once been disappointed, though I got a lock, he still keeps yanking the door handle, and when I forget to lock it, he scores)
In the bathroom, he used to do that when I was younger and taking baths, we didn’t have a shower curtain around the bath, and he just came in to do whatever, usually just kept washing his hands for a really really long time, now I got a shower curtain, and this doesn’t happen often but he still comes in. Once he pushed the curtain away to see if someone’s showering because “he didn’t know”(the shower was running, pretty fucking hard to miss). 
2am in my room, barges in, flicks on the light and comes to say some stupid shit to help with(now I don’t mind helping him, but whatever I do I’m always at fault, and even with helping he acts like I’m making everything worse) 
and just casually when I’m getting dressed. 
I have other horrible memories with him, when I caught him cheating on my mom(almost kissing the fucking bitch in front of me, wasn’t exactly hard), and sexting others. He came clean by showing every single chat he had in his account(while the sexting shit still appeared in deleted messages, good job). My room had a computer and he kept watching porn on it(knowing from the browser history I kept deleting) which is okay, we know their marriage is a flop, but please not in your 13 something year old boys room. I don’t remember this clearly, because I don’t want to, but at least once he left his jizz on my carpet and chair, I had to clean it up, I didn’t tell anyone. 
Just some examples. 
He keeps finding some shitty excuse for everything, right now he justifies opening the door on my room with that there’s mold in the corners, and it has to breathe. 
So the reason I’m writing this, the last drop was today, this morning I took a shower, got a towel on, went to my room to dry, and closed the door.
I was naked, obviously, and for a reason I put earphones in, I couldn’t hear outside. Next thing is that I look up at my door, he’s standing there, door fully open, looked him in the eye and then he turned and left, leaving the door wide open. 
I sent some warm hearted words after him, and he felt okay defending himself and then proceeded to victimise himself too, for whatever the fuck completely different reason, all in the same argument. 

What can I do now? I can’t take this anymore, I just want to kill myself to not feel so so violated and disgusted all the time. 
I’m already paranoid, and feeling like someone is watching me, listening to me at all times, seriously there’s no stopping in that, I’m constantly searching for cameras in my room he could have placed, checking the wardrobe, I don’t know what it feels like to be safe and normal.  Not just at home, anywhere I am. I check everything. There’s no chance anyone can watch me like that, but I don’t really think this is normal.

(now don’t be worried I don’t need a suicide hotline, I’m 100% set on trying to keep living, I have solid goals I want to reach before giving in. I guess I’ll just have to live with this, but I’d like it to change some)

Edit: Thank you for reading

Update: after this morning I caught him eavesdropping on us when going home from grandparents(next door). I was talking with my grandpa and cousin(moms side btw), and just casually being outside because it’s a snowy good day, then quickly decided to go home without loudly announcing it, because I thought he would be listening to us. So I went home, and me being quick and quiet, I did actually find him hiding behind the corner. He heard me opening the gate, but because of the hedge he has limited movement there, he barely could go a few meters on the sidewalk. So anyway I was going to our house, and he was just standing there like a dumb fuck, doing nothing and looking away from me. Lovely -1/10 experience today. "

32590,85kadu,19Username95,Roommate hogs the shared bathroom.,"My roommate regularly spends a ridiculously long time our shared bathroom. In the morning, she'll be in there for at least 30 to 40 minutes applying make-up, etc. If she's taking a shower, she'll be in there for an hour, sometimes an hour and a half. 

The obvious solution is to knock and I sometimes do. However, I feel awkward when I do and under pressure to get out ASAP. I'd rather not have to rush brushing my teeth because I know she's hanging around outside the door waiting for me to finish.

Is it reasonable for me to ask that she buys a mirror for her bedroom to apply her make-up (which is what I've done because I don't want to hog a shared bathroom) and cut back on shower times? I've had bad experiences with roommates in the past and would rather not say anything if it was going to become a big thing. "

26760,8vot5j,midimarc,Chickens coming home to roost,"I had a client in 2010 for whom I set up a Google apps account and did a bunch of work for, and he never paid me. I sent him several emails requesting that he pay me for my work and eventually he stopped taking my calls and responding to my emails. So I just let it go. Last week I started getting cc’ed on emails between him and Google because he couldn’t get into his account and I was listed as Admin still. This morning he emailed me directly asking for me to help him recover his account.  I barely remembered that he hadn’t paid me but I had a funny feeling about it so I looked back on my emails and found the email exchange with me pleading for him to pay me for my work.  I forwarded it to him and reminded him that he still owed me $309 from 2010 and requested that he pay me what he owed me plus interest, $500 total. He immediately called me and went off on me saying that I was holding his Account hostage and that he always pays his debts and that he never was told that he owed me anything. Am I wrong for ignoring him and asking that he pay me what he owes me plus interest, a total of $500?"

76,ejytw9,MingledSpringle,suffering from gaming/yt/anime burnout and trying to study by cutting off everything but not sure if it's a good idea,"i used to spend my entire time online; watching videos or playing games. around mid 2018, i slowly started to get exhausted, i really didn't feel any fun in playing games or watching videos, but i kept forcing myself to try and do them so i could enjoy them

so this new year, i thought maybe i should cut back on games and music and yt and shit and even twitter bc i realised it's making me feel more and more tired and everytime i try to study, my brain goes off in about 15 seconds before i can even focus. 

so yesterday i decided to not open my laptop and deleted everyhing from my phone and didn't watch anime the entire day and tried to study (sort of)

i didn't' study much but i realised i wasn't bored the entire time because my brain was so active, i was busy all the time

today i managed to focus for 5 hours and finished 15 pages of organic chem which after 2 years of ignoring studies for the most part felt really good but then my focus started wavering and i felt tired as shit , for the most part,

so now im wondering if it's even worth leaving everything behind for studying, i can't possibly study all the time, should i still use my laptop and play games and stuff? or maybe for the sake of getting over my burnout continue this?

i also don't know about twitter, it's my only source of human interaction besides seeing my mom because i don't go to school these days so i feel really lonely but it's not like i have more than 2 people who interatc with me on twitter sometimes so im really conflicted

i also realised how long this is lol sorry i just haven't talked to anyone in 2 days and needed to let it out"

My friend, we'll refer to as ""B"", has severe depression. I met B 2 years ago, and we've been best friends since. 3 months after I met her, she told me she has depression and has to go to therapy (normal therapist for stuff like this, as far as I know). About 6 months ago, she started to get better. 2 months ago, she started cutting herself. She would have panic attacks on discord calls, and actually once purposefully burned herself on call. Starting 1 month ago, she's started to get worse. B now has to go to intensive therapy at the local hospital. Since September 2018, she's been suicidal, and only in January of this year has her parents taken more action. Her prescription drugs for her depression got switched, and she said that helped. But now, her meds have to be put in a lockbox so she doesn't overdose, and whenever her parents are gone, she sometimes cuts. She told me that she does it to de-stress, and that sometimes she thinks her parents don't give her enough attention so she does it for attention. I've tried everything I can (at least, I hope) and have even texted her mom once or twice if I knew she was cutting on call. I want to help so badly, and she misses class now 3 days a week for the last period for therapy. She is also afraid her parents will get mad at her if she tells them more. A day ago, she rummaged through her dad's lockbox for something to cut herself with (they almost completely baby proofed the house of cutting materials) and he called her out, but B wouldn't admit it. Today she texted me she was getting a panic attack, and she sliced herself with a pushpin. What do I do? How do I help?"

36040,7ub7hj,269berkay,in need of advices,what do you guys do or not do when you have zero motivation to do something you should be doing? For instance studying. Lately i feel like doing nothing but i also know that i should be studying. that makes me  on a guilt trip eventually. 
19094,b3l8sr,Sky-Roshy,One should never eavesdrop on family talks where you’re not invited,"Just an hour ago, at the time of writing this post, I overheard my parents and my younger stepbrother talking about me. They were talking about how silly I was when I was a little kid, you know, the usual cringey stuff kids do. My stepbro even brought up the time when we were kids, I used to bury broken toys and hold little funerals for them.

I didn’t mind all of this stuff because it really is funny, granted it’s a bit odd, but I was a kid! Hahaha
But then they my mom brought up about my schooling back then. How I stopped for 1 year after kindergarten because I hated public school and they had to move me to private just so I could get motivated about school again. Mind you, we’re just a middle class family. Moving me to a private institution was a tough decision for my parents, especially considering that my dad has other mouths to feed (story for another time).

But then there was this one thing that my mom said that really caught my attention. She said that moving me to private school was a really wise decision because the teachers in the said school are mostly focused on special ed students. Upon hearing this, I was like “ok? what does that have to do with me??” Then my dad continued by complaining about how everything about me is always supposed to be ‘fancy’ (again, we’re not rich). I always knew that my parents thought that raising me up is a bit high-maintenance, but I never actually heard them say it, let alone this way.

Then my mom told my stepbrother (trying her best to say it softly, though i can still hear her) that no one in the family should ever tell anyone, especially to me, that I’m a child with special needs. That I’m autistic. And my father added “[my name] IS a special child”. He didn’t say it in an endearing way. Try to imagine a conservative catholic dad telling his brother from church that he just found out that his son is gay. That. There was both disgust and shame in his voice. I couldn’t remember much after that, I kinda blanked out. I guess they just continued sharing stories to support this whole thing about me being autistic.

My dear reader, I’m telling you this right now with all my heart and as tears stream down my face, I’m not autistic. I don’t have autism. I may be a bit introverted but that’s pretty much it. I don’t have anything against anyone within the spectrum, but you have to understand I’m just really hurt to hear it (considering it came from people I trusted and respected the most) because I’m not. 

My friends know I’m not what my parents say. My teachers would also disagree. I just... I don’t know how to feel about this. I know I shouldn’t mind what they said coz I know the truth about me. But it still hurts. I’m already 18 btw, so hearing this now really hurts a lot.

How am I gonna face them again? I mean fuck it was just an hour ago. I don’t know how to feel about it. I really don’t. I’m so lost rn. I’m just crying right now because I really don’t have anyone else rn to tell about it.

Well anyway, with tears wiped and all, and seeing this is r/Advice (first time btw), any advice on how the hell can I cope with this bs? Or at least how to face my parents again when I wake up? "
32412,85zmt5,KINGUBERMENSCH,I feel lost and unmotivated after failing boot camp.,"Its been a month since i got back home from MCRD (Marine Corps Recruit Depot), and i feel terrible. To make it as short as possible, i only made it through 3 weeks of training out of 12, and i got dropped due to Adjustment Disorder and lack of confidence. Over there i felt like i was constantly doing all i can to  keep afloat, i was just miserable and scared all the time. Everything i did over there, i constantly 2nd guessed myself despite being told ""if you fuck up, fuck up with confidence."" I wanted to be a Marine for several reasons:

1. To be free of my parents.
2. Get a job
3. Improve myself as a person (even before boot i was unconfident and a loner.)
4. Get Stronger physically and Mentally.
5. It sounded fun.

Despite all those reasons motivating me and me resolved to not go home in failure despite me being utterly miserable, i failed. The worst part was that my Senior Drill Instructor told me that he talked with a few other DIs and company officers and they all wanted me to stay, but the psychologists said i wasnt fit to train. And then i had to go home humiliated to my parents, who never approved of me going to boot at all due to religious reasons (Jehovah Witnesses), thankfully they never abused me and still love me. And feeling like i wasted 8 months of my life training. Granted over time i gradually felt better due to talking with my friends and even my recruiters, who told me that it was a doctor's order that i get dropped, not me throwing in the towel. But a month has passed and despite applying for college and a job, i feel empty. I stopped working out and all i do is go on my precious laptop and leech off my parents, who i want to get away from ASAP with my own apartment. Part of me wants to go apply for the Navy since im eligible for another branch, but im unsure if thats what i really want in life, let alone if i have the mental strength to make it through despite being easier and shorter than Marine boot camp. At the same time, i feel like if i dont, ill feel unfulfilled my whole life. I just feel lost and tired all the time..."

The day before I'd been sick with what I thought was food poisoning, but the night before the party my kids were also a bit sick. But the morning came and they seemed fine, and I was also better so we went ahead. Six families with kids of various ages came. 

Tonight one of my friends called me and said they weren't happy that I didn't let them know ahead of time that we'd been ill so they could've had the option not to attend (but so far they are all ok), I apologised and then messaged everyone else who came to apologise for not giving them the heads up and seeing if they are ok. 

Another friend wrote back and is (justifiably) pretty upset because their eldest is sick and they are worried their other kids will get it, one of whom has a very expensive, very important trip booked this weekend. I apologised profusely and have offered to cover any out of pocket costs of it comes to that, but acknowledged that it's much more than just money to them. 

Two others have written back and are ok so far, and I haven't heard from the other two (potentially because they are bent over the toilet, who knows?)

My question is, what else can I do to make this right? I feel so terrible for being thoughtless and not sending out a message the morning of the party to let everyone know we'd been ill. How can I make this up to the people who are sick and/or very unhappy with me?

Tl;dr: I fucked up by holding my kid's party the day after we had a stomach bug. People are sick and/or pissed at me. How can I make things right?"

24095,99uf82,RegularMisanthrope,My mother is trying to encourage my siblings and I to engage with our estranged father.,"My father has been out of my family's life for nearly ten years now and before that point he was involved/lived with us sporadically. A few years ago he moved back to the country where he was born. As of now my parents are separated although I don't know why my mother won't divorce him. 

Ever since I can remember my mother has gone above and beyond to raise three children by herself and my father has been reluctantly involved or not at all. He doesn't and has rarely ever helped out financially. This summer my mother and my younger sibling went to our home country to visit my mom's parents. My parents are from the same town so of course my mother met up with him. 

He didn't even come to greet her at the airport...her elderly parents, and some of her siblings came to greet her. She hasn't been back home for almost fifteen years now because all of her finances go to paying rent, her children, etc

My younger sibling has been messaging me upset that my mother is trying to force interactions between them and our father because ""he's your dad.""  This frustrates me so much. My mother is only on vacation there for less than two weeks and they really wasted an entire day (today) spending time with my father. My younger sibling said that our mother was trying to get them to spend time together even when my sibling explicitly said they didn't want to. Not to mention they are the least connected to him because for most of their life he hasn't been there. 

So I guess my question is how can I make my mom understand why it's wrong for her to try to make us engage with someone we have no connection to/ don't want contact with ? "
4081,d8e93m,That_Technician,I was humiliated by my boss and am losing motivation and becoming anxious,"At work my boss came into the main room where the 6 main staff work (it's only a small company, so we all work extremely closely together) he comes in and starts complaining to us about our effectiveness on the previous day, we explained the circumstances and what variables slowed us down but still told us we were disrespecting him by leaving on time without achieving a decent enough level of efficiency.

Immediately after, he proceeded to tell me that I'm causing 90% of the problems that the company is experiencing and I need to be retrained and step up my performance. If the company experiences too many reports then we'll be shut down, he specifically told me that if this happens everyone will lose their jobs, I began to cry while continuing working. 

In front of all my colleagues, I just got humiliated by being told my performance is unacceptable and I'm putting everyone's jobs at risk, then I proceeded to cry in front of them, I can't bear to show my face tomorrow, and be re-trained in front of everyone, I can't help but think they're going to doubt my ability to perform anymore. I can't stand this.

One of my colleagues tried to defend me and asked to see the reports on the problems I caused as they said I know what I'm doing and it might not necessarily be my fault directly. It made me feel more comfortable around that colleague, but I just can't bear the thought of them all seeing me as weak and incapable of doing my own job. I'm terrified of the social pressure and beginning to doubt myself.

I’m so far away from my diploma, it’ll take years to get all credits i need to graduate high school, lost contact with my parents and family and i’m constantly broke. I’m always depressed with no motivation, it’s hard to see all of my friends happily maintaining jobs, saving money, being loved and supported by their parents, and killing time until they go to school.

28177,8o1vps,GanglandMoonchild,I [18M] feel like I wasted high school and didn’t make as much friends as I could have and I’m regretting it big time. How can I use this to better myself and put myself out there more instead of dwelling on it?,"I’m graduating high school next Thursday and I just feel like everything is ending, and it’s making me feel sad. I don’t want to fee sad about it, I want to look back on it and see how much fun I had, because I did have fun, but I keep looking back and regretting so much stuff now. I wasn’t popular but I was friends with all the popular people I just never hung out with them, we just knew each other and a few I knew more than others. I wish I was able to put myself out there, I wish I played football, did ASB, stuff like that where you’re introduced to much more people, instead I stayed closed off because at the time I was lazy and thought I had enough friends and didn’t seem it worth it. Now I’m slowly realizing I could have ended up with better friends and I just never took that chance. 

A lot of these “popular” people wrote in my yearbook that they wish we got to know each other better, and as cliche as it sounds I feel like I wasted so many opportunities to have more close better friends. I never talked much, I’m not too shy, I can talk in front of people without a problem, just in high school looking back on it I’m already regretting not talking a lot, not putting my self out there to make more friends, when I easily could have. 

I also have a super close family friend that’s been with me since I was 3 and they told me they were moving to North Carolina for college (I’m in California). Which is crazy because it just feels like everything is over and it’s scary having it all start again in college, it doesn’t feel right. I’m going to a junior college near my high school for General Ed as are the majority of people from all the high schools somewhat near me are doing. So I’ve been told it’s like a “second high school but without the drama”. So I think I’ll know a lot of people there. 

I would just like to ask for advice on how to turn this feeling of regret in high school into something I can use to better my self instead of dwelling on it and making me feel more sad. I wouldn’t normally say hi to many people in the hallway or when they walk into class, but I want to change that in this last week and when I go to college, I just don’t know how. I want to be happy and smile about us moving onto the next chapter instead of getting sad that I didn’t put my self out there. I want to make a change and then look back on how I was able to use my “closed off” high school self to make me more open in the last few days of high school and through summer an into college."

I get SO OVERWHELMED whenever they speak with me whether it's through text or in person, and I get VERY, **VERY** depressed when they don't. I have always struggled with clinical depression thorough my teenage years, and yet it has never been as bad as it is now when he doesn't talk to me.

Last week I remember not getting out of bed for three whole days waiting for him to text me or call me, just because I took these days off and I wouldn't get to see him again.

34182,80p7r9,swimtheocean,"Do I have a sad life ahead of me? Living with parents, no job, no girlfriend.","I'm 22 years old. I live at home with my parents. I currently have no job. I've never had a girlfriend even though I'm attractive. I've been asked out by girls back in high school but with my social anxiety I've always rejected them out of fear. 

My social anxiety stems from a few things. Mainly from being molested and bullied when I was a kid. I could sit here and blame other people for my problems like I always have but the truth is I am where I am of my own volition. I have no one to blame but myself. 

For the past four years I've been living my life isolated from society only allowing myself to get worse and worse. Now I get anxiety just by having to go out and get my haircut. It's pathetic. 

I have no source of income. Without the help of my parents I'd be out on the streets. I realize how lucky I am. I'm forever in their debt. It's time to make a change and push myself to get a job. No, it was time for that awhile ago but better late then never. 

I'm applying for a part time job in retail. I'm not even worried about getting hired. I know I'll get the job because my dad is friends with the manager and he said he'll gladly hire me. 

I'll be working 20 hours a week making $11 an hour. I've calculated what I'll make after taxes, paying my parents for rent, food, water, electricity, gas, car insurance, ect. 

And I'll have $335 leftover every month to spend on whatever I want. 

My parents house is evaluated at $200,000. The house is paid off. They said the house goes to me after they die which I'm not hoping for anytime soon. Me and my parents have a very good relationship with each other and I love them to bits. I wouldn't count on them passing away for at least another 40 years. So by that time I'll be in 60's. 

Is this a terrible idea? Would this really be a sad life for me? Living with my parents for the majority of my life. Financially I would be set and I would never have to worry about a place to live. I would only have to work 20 hours a week. After paying for all the important stuff I would have $335 every month to spend on anything I'd like or save up for anything I'd like. I could go on trips every year, I could buy my dream PC in no time, I could buy gifts for my family. I would have so much time to do meaningful things. Do volunteer work. Find someone nice to live my life with. 

For how I've been living my life for the past four years with nothing, that sounds like a pretty easy life to me. Perhaps no women would ever want me. But would saving up for a cheap home and moving out really change that? I'd still be socially awkward and then I wouldn't be making nearly as much money. 

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my post and is willing to share their advice. I really appreciate it. :)

16173,bjhyca,YaBoiChiefy,I think I’m fucking with myself,"Hey y’all, pretty new to posting, so sorry for screwing this up or something. But I just wanted to see what you all think. I’ve been talking to this girl for a while and eventually we’d told each other we like one another and I was stoked, we’ve gone on a couple dates and it’s been very easy to talk and I’ve had fun and I think she has too, the dates aren’t the problem. In between these and at the moment I’ve been having extreme anxiety about whether or not she actually likes me or she just feels bad, the thing is I don’t really believe that. A lot of our communication happens over text and she seems engaged and stuff so that’s cool, but I still have this lingering feeling of doubt in my mind and I’m not sure why. A lot of people have also mentioned me overthinking other things and I think that could be happening here.

I’ve had one experience dating before and it was pretty rough on me, there was a lot of pressure by peers because it was a smaller environment than I’m in now and I didn’t actually like the person. There was a bit of pressure by the girl too to be cool or act all couple and it was very unnatural and wrong. I eventually broke up with that girl and I was bullied a while for it. It was just an overall negative experience.

Do you guys think that that bad relationship is putting doubt in me for this new one and how do I calm down a bit about this girl? 

Thanks for anything you guys have to say"

8757,cjv9x0,false-and-homosexual,Boyfriend is making me self conscious,"I'm gonna preface this by saying that I'm pretty sure he says all this shit without thinking, and that he's not intentionally trying to hurt me. He also compliments me more than insults. I just want someone to tell me if I'm overreacting or maybe tips to fix some stuff.

When we first kissed, he immediately pulled back and said I was terrible at it. Three times.

We were talking on the phone 2 days ago, and doing that cringy 'no i like u more' shit, and he said 'maybe you do like me more i dont really know it could be true'. He said he didn't want it to be true, but that it might be. 

Those things didn't make me terribly insecure because he apologized and seemed embarrassed. He apologized for the next things, but they make me feel really bad about myself.

So he was gonna go down on me, and he suggested it. I told him I was self conscious about it, and that I'm fat, and I didn't want him to see my stomach. I went through with it because he complimented me and said that I shouldn't be self conscious. I obviously still was, and I was having a lot of anxiety about it being my first time or whatever. So clothes come off, and he immediately says, ""wow you stink"". And tells me that next time I need to shower. I had showered less than an hour before we started. 

Then, it was his turn, and he couldn't finish. At least, not with me. He went into the bathroom and was done in like 3 minutes. I told him later to show me what he usually does, and I did that, but it still didn't work. He took over and said that he was super good at doing it, implying that I was doing a bad job/he wasn't enjoying it.

I don't know how to get over these insecurities. I feel like he really is sorry, I'm not going to break up with him because he's awkward. I just feel so ugly."
13400,bwkktw,Seankala,How to deal with a potentially schizophrenic friend? I went to the police station because of him and he hasn't apologized or given an explanation. I don't want to lose him as a friend but I don't know what to do.,"Hello. First off I'd like to start by saying that I'm no medical professional, and that's why I say ""potentially schizophrenic"" as my friend (we'll call him Michael) also hasn't mentioned anything.

I'll provide some basic background info as to what happened. There are a group of friends (around 5-6 people) that I hang out with semi-regularly on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Last Friday we went to our usual bar but it was just Michael, another friend who I'll call Andy, and myself.

Things were just normal but Michael seemed quite down. I asked him if everything was okay and he said ""life's tough but it'll get better"" as he's been struggling with his job and he was actually on paid leave when we met. I just told him that if he needed to talk or needed help with anything his friends were there for him.

About half an hour later my girlfriend stopped by and said hi, but she hadn't had dinner yet so we decided to step out to a nearby restaurant to get something to eat. I left my backpack with Michael and Andy and said I'd be back real quick.

At the restaurant, I get a call from Andy. He asks ""Hey, you brought your bag today with you right?"" I didn't like the tone of the question but said I did. Andy proceeded to say ""Okay well Michael just took your bag and ran off. I tried to stop him but he just kept saying 'Tell Sean (me) I'll get him a new bag' and tried to fight me.""

I called Michael and asked him what the hell is going on. He just kept asking me ""Sean, what's in your bag?"" I thought this was some sick prank but played along. He then said ""Are you sure you don't have a grenade in here?"" to which I chuckled and said ""No I don't. Michael this isn't funny please stop."" He said he needed to go and hung up.

My girlfriend and I left quickly and met Andy on the way. I called Michael and he said he's nearby and he called 911 and is with the police. I began to run towards where he is and found him talking to two officers. I found my backpack nearby in the middle of a plaza and ran to pick it up. A nearby police officer stopped me and said to be careful because they got a call saying the bag contained a grenade.

I said that's ridiculous and started emptying my backpack. Police officers and detectives all swarmed me to ask me how I knew Michael, what exactly happened, and if he's done this before.

The police took Michael, my girlfriend, and me back to the police station to fill out some reports and forms. They said that they'll run tests on Michael and see if he's suffering from a mental disease but if not he'll be charged for making a false report. My girlfriend and I spent about 20 minutes writing our reports and left. I tried to get my friend's attention but he wouldn't look at me.

The next day on Saturday I texted Michael asking if he's home and okay. He just said ""I'm good thanks."" The next day on Sunday I called him to see if he's okay. I wasn't too happy though. At one point in the conversation I asked him what exactly happened at the bar when was gone. He kept saying ""I told everything to the police and they're in the process of taking care of it, but I don't think you're in trouble."" I told him that frankly I'm not worried about being in trouble and he snapped back ""Then why are you asking?"" I just said that 1. I'm worried about him and 2. I feel I have a right for at least an explanation because I went to the police station unnecessarily. He just remained quiet.

Andy and I tried talking to our other friends who know Michael and they said it sounds like schizophrenia but they're not sure either. One of them is a psychiatrist and she urged him to go seek professional help either from her or someone else. I told them how I felt a bit frustrated that I didn't get an apology or an explanation and he just seems nonchalant about it as if he doesn't care I went through all that trouble. They told me to talk to him face to face but to be frank I'm not too keen on that idea either.

Has anyone ever experienced similar experiences? What should I do? I don't want to lose him as a friend but I'm feeling at this rate I will.

P.S. if it helps, Michael did mention earlier on Friday that he's on medication and so he can't drink. He also has a habit of recording everything. I thought was for fun at first, but I'm starting to think maybe it has something to do with this incident."
5949,cyfy8u,bitchfromplanetweird,I hate my boyfriends dog,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years. And last year he decided to get a Great Dane. Which is fine because I have a small dog myself. Also last year we decided to move apart because we couldn’t afford to have a place of our own and living under our parents roof was because to much, so we go to each other house often. 

Well every time I go to his house this giant ass dog jumps all over me and barks and doesn’t know how to calm down! It drives me insane! I try to be stern with the dog but every single time I try he intervenes and never allows me to train the dog to respect me! He’s so damn fragile about the dog from how I walk him to house I try to let him potty. It’s ALWAYS SOMETHING. And honestly the dog is such a cry baby it’s whines ALL THE TIME and it can’t be left alone in another room. And sometimes he brings the dog to my house and it jumps on my bed and I hate that! 

There’s times when I want to just relax and the dogs starts whining because it wants attention so he goes,

Anyways I’m close to purchasing my own house and my boyfriend has expressed that he would love to live together which I would have an issue with if it wasn’t for his damn dog! I don’t want him to get rid of the dog I just wish he’d train it better but every time I tell him, he yells at me that his dog is fine. 

I don’t want my new home to be filled with negative energy and arguments over a dog.

Two cubes down from me is a younger, recently hired woman. For privacy, we'll call her Sara. I have briefly chatted with her a few times and she seems very nice. Her boss, we'll call him Tim, is and older man with a loud voice.

 I would say 4-5 times a day, Tim walks over, and stands in Sara's doorway talking to her for a good 15-20 minutes. He talk about his wife, his house, weather, sports, just anything. She always responds with ""Yes"", ""Oh?"" Or a very obviously fake giggle. Seemingly trying to focus on her work while not being rude to her boss.

Yesterday I happened to be walking by when Tim was talking to Sara. I briefly looked in at her, and she shot me a look. She widened her eyes and watched me the whole time I was walking by. She was sat up completely straight in her chair, almost as if in a defensive mode.  She really looked nervous and uncomfortable.

so I have my Venmo on my tinder profile. It started as a joke but people did actually start sending me money. Anyhow, three months ago this one random dude I never matched with sent me $100. I never heard anything from him again. 

Yesterday he came back. He started sending me increments of $300 and gave me his phone number. A total of $1500 he sent me that one day. I texted him (which I’m starting to regret) to ask him why. He said he just likes to see people’s reactions. 

The conversation was just me telling him thanks numerous times. He then asked what I was doing over the weekend, but I told him I was busy. End of story, end of conversation.  Haven’t heard from him. 

Now, as happy as I am for getting the money- I am very scared because my friends pointed out different theories- that he could be a human trafficker, or a crazy stalker that’s getting my info somehow, etc etc... what do you guys think?

I told myself the other day the I would invite her on a date , because recently we started talking more and I really enjoy spending time with her , that day I didn't managed to invite her , I wanted to do it in person but was so nervous.

The next day , I messaged her directly on Facebook to invite her to a place she mentioned she'd like to go (I tough that messaging her directly would imply the ""date"" type of hangout). We usually go out with a bunch of friends , and I dont know if she understood that it wasn't what I had in mind. She's too busy with school this week so , I told her , lets talk about it in two week and she agreed.

Now , I'm not sure how I should get back to her , she hasn't mention our friends in her replies so I really dont know what to think of it. I dont know how to ask if she understood what I had in mind. Without making it awkward if that makes sens.

4111,d87pfw,itsblazequasar,How do I tell my (f)friend that her (m)fiancé is having a gay affair?,"About a month ago, one of my (m)friends from college revealed to me that he has been seeing my (f)friend’s (m)fiancé for over 5 years. The engaged couple is scheduled to be married in 4 weeks. I feel I have a moral obligation to tell her in some way, but I have two obstacles.

1. Her fiancé is a cop in our city. He is very well connected, and I fear if he finds that I am the one who exposes him, he could retaliate in some way. He has a limited knowledge of my drug habits and on any given day there is pot in my house. 

2. My friend has been suicidal in the past, and now works as a mental health counselor. Due to the heavy nature of this situation, I’m not sure how she would react. They have been engaged for two years and dating for 5 years. 

They have also just recently bought a house together, so they are financially entwined. For these reasons, I believe the best way to tell her is in an anonymous letter. But that is as far as I have gotten. I have told my girlfriend and my roommate who are also good friends with the (f)fiancé, and my friend who has been sleeping with the (m)fiancé wants to stay out of it. 

We have basically reached the conclusion that because we know, we have to let her know, else we feel responsible for letting her enter into a marriage doomed from the start. 

The only resources i have are screenshots of his tinder profile. I have received snaps of my friend with the (m)fiancé that showed his face and naked body in the same picture to prove that the affair is happening, but I didn’t get any screenshots, and having those pictures from a specific location would destroy any anonymity.

Please help me, I don’t want my friend of 6 years to unknowingly marry a cheater.


TL;DR

My friends fiancé is having a gay affair, and I want to anonymously expose him before their wedding in 1 month. Please help me! I don’t want her to walk blindly into this situation!"

14044,btm9n0,Matt17908992,Son is obsessed with video games.,"So, my five year old LOVES video games. If given the choice he would play them all day. We aren't too sure what to do about it.  We've seen the research that says too much TV time and games can cause ADHD and we would hate for that too happen.

Our biggest complaints with him playing games: [1] He gets very upset when he can't figure something out. [2] He pitches a fit if we ask him to do a quick chore or anything else. [3] He wakes up early in the morning to start playing. He will play for HOURS if we let him.

Other than those complaints (which are big) it doesn't affect him. He is ahead of the kids in his class as far as his learning in school. He's very sociable with the kids in the neighborhood and loves to play outside with them when they can. The games he does play are problem-solving games that most kids his age wouldn't be able to play anyways. He is involved in basketball and soccer soon enough.

I grew up with a brother addicted to video games so I almost hate games in general besides the ones I play once in awhile.    

I've thought about getting him into computer coding, graphic design or something as he gets older so that he can merge it with his love for games.  I, myself, am a mechanical engineer so I want to push him in a stem related field but would ultimately be ok with him doing whatever he loves to do. I just want make sure it doesnt hurt him in other areas of his life. Should I embrace him in his love for games or should I try to limit as much as possible him playing?"
30451,8df2p4,callofthewylde,Should I have spoken up when I saw a waitress being mistreated?,"Last night I was at dinner with a friend and there was a couple seated next to us that were seriously being so awful to the waitress. She brought them their drinks and the guy looked at her and goes ‘this glass is filthy, is there something wrong with your eyesight?’ and made her take them back. Even if the glass was dirty, he could have just pointed that out and asked nicely for a new clean glass. 

Then when they ordered their appetizers, they specifically said they just wanted one order of sweet potato fries, and when the waitress brought out one they got mad at her and said they should have been given two orders, and when the waitress said ‘oh I’m so sorry, i thought you just ordered the one, I’ll go have them make another’ they replied ‘we did only order one but you should’ve brought two to make up for the dirty glasses, we shouldn’t have to ask you to make things right’. They also kept calling her ‘young lady’ very condescendingly. 

So then when their food comes out they call the waitress back a few minutes later and say that it’s cold/inedible, and I watched them, they literally didn’t even take one single bite, just pushed the food around on their plates. At this point you could tell the waitress was getting a little upset but she said she was sorry and offered to bring them something new, and the guy said something like ‘hey don’t act like you’re doing us a favor here, your job is to provide service and so far we’ve gotten none’. And literally shoved the plate into her hands. 

They send their dishes back and she comes back with new ones not long after and they complain about how long it took (it could not have been more than ten minutes for all new dishes). They eat some of their food and then when the waitress comes back to check on them the woman says (I’m quoting her) ‘we need to-go boxes and there had better be a free dessert or a deep discount because you are an extremely poor excuse for a server. Extremely poor’. She kept repeating ‘extremely poor’ and I wanted to go over there and stuff my napkin in her mouth to shut her up. 

My friend and I were literally speechless. We had a different server and we told him what was going on and said we hoped that the couple wouldn’t be given a discount or anything free because they were obviously just trying to antagonize their waitress. Our server thanked us for letting him know and didn’t say much more after that. But now I’m wondering if I should’ve said something directly to the rude couple or spoken to the manager myself, because these people were seriously awful. I am 99% sure they were just trying to get their meal for free, and also 99% sure they made the poor girl cry. 

So Reddit, what do you think, should I call the restaurant today and let the manager know what happened? It’s too late to say anything to the rude couple but if I’m ever in a situation like that again, I should probably speak up, right?  "
7746,coxk1l,LouTenant6767,"I need help urgently. Call the cops or not? (USA, SC)","Me and abusive ex just got into a fist fight. He started throwing a temper tantrum this morning and it escalated after he snatched my phone out of my hand and threw it.

I have bruises all over my arms, one on my stomach and strangulation marks. He grabbed my head and banged it on the floor so I might have a concussion.

He had me corned and wouldn't let me get away. So I punched him in the mouth and he started pouring blood. Blood all over the towel and his shirt and the floor.

We have cats. I've been isolated so I don't have a job. Any time I've brought up getting a job, it resulted in another fight.

If I call the cops on him, will I go to jail because of his lip? I can't risk my babies not having a way to be fed or taken away. 

He left because I told him I was calling them. 

Side note: I may have a friend who could help me move out and in with her. I'm waiting for a response."
5736,czmfkr,puzzlepasta,How do I go about my boyfriend having a porn twitter account,"In my country, porn twitter accounts are called alter accounts (like alter persona) People here use it for hooking up and videotaping the deed. My boyfriend confessed he has an twitter porn account even after we’re together. But when he showed me his tweets, a lot of it was deleted (google cache takes a while to refresh so I saw deleted tweets) He’s admitted to having posted himself doing solo stuff( google cache suggests differently)

He says he’ll delete the account. I told him I’m okay with giving him freedom to watch porn. But instead he made the account private so i couldn’t see what he’s posting. I asked a friend to send him a follow request and he has only liked tweets of videotaped hookups. 

I feel really bad for wanting to keep an eye on the twitter account instead of telling him to shut it down because I want to immediately if he’s cheating on me. I don’t exactly know how to feel about the situation. I wanna ask for some options I can go for, if you guys could help me"

14881,bposzl,ChipsAndTapatio,Am I going to ruin my kids' birthday party?,"TL;DR right here because this is long: **I have an apparent dental infection, a swollen face, and two more days to prepare for my kids' birthday party on Sunday. My dentist can't see me until Monday. Am I going to incapacitate myself or end up in the emergency room? What can I do to help myself and not ruin my kids' party?**

Here's what's going on: On Sunday, I got a toothache out of nowhere. It's in my upper jaw, up under my molars, which have crowns (and have undergone root canals, so they have no nerves inside). Every time my teeth made contact on that side, one of the molars felt like it was electrified. First thing on Monday I spent half the day on the phone updating our Medicaid application because for some reason our dental had lapsed. Got it reinstated, but it won't be active until June 1st. The dentist says fine, I can pay out of pocket, but couldn't give me an appointment until this following Monday.

As the days go on, I'm barely able to function, the pain is so bad. As the week progressed it spread and deepened to an overall throbbing on the whole lower left side of my face. My upper jaw, my lower jaw, the teeth, the gums, my cheek, all of it so painful I'm walking around with an ice pack and doing warm salt water rinses every few hours. I've been taking Advil and Tylenol, and some Benzocaine (an over-the-counter topical thing for mouth pain). You have to limit the amount of times you use these things per day, so yesterday I ended up also getting clove oil, diluting it with olive oil, and rubbing that on my gums. Amazingly, it really helped. I've also been hydrating like crazy, taking my multivitamin and a B complex (because apparently that's good for oral health?), and eating only soft foods.

So now it's 4am on Friday morning, and miraculously there's less pain - but my left cheek is visibly swollen. I also have a hoarse voice and cold symptoms, which could mean I finally caught the cold my daughter had last weekend, or could be something more sinister. Do I have a gum infection that led to an infection in my bone? Do I have an abscess hiding in there somewhere? Do I have like, cancer or something? I don't know but I'm wondering what in the hell I'm going to look/feel like on Sunday, because...

My two young kids' birthday party (their birthdays are near each other and they share roughly the same friend group, so we have a joint party for both of them) is on Sunday. My in-laws are coming later today to visit for the weekend. All of our family friends and the kids' schoolmates and their parents, and my family, and my wife's folks of course, are going to be here on Sunday.

As you might imagine, there's been a lot of preparation here. I had to cut the grass, pull up poison ivy (!!!), and clean the house. In the coming days I have to buy and prepare food, bake a cake, do more cleaning, decorate, and be hella social the whole time. I've had very little time to get my work done (I'm a freelancer), and could barely function earlier in the week when the pain was bad but I hadn't yet figured out how to get on top of it.

So now I'm sitting up at 4am wondering: Am I going to look like a monster by Sunday? Am I going to go into septic shock or something? Is the pain going to come back even worse? Will I be able to function or will I be in the ER? Or am I overreacting, and the swelling is going to go down, and everything is going to be fine, and I'll get through this and get some antibiotics on Monday?

Oh, and if anyone has seen my daughter's stuffed puppy toy, let me know where it's hiding. I've turned the house upside down looking for it and it's still missing in action.

Has anyone here experienced similar dental issues? How did it turn out?  Is there anything I can do that I haven't done to help make sure I don't utterly ruin my kids' birthday party that they've been looking forward to for so long? Thanks for any advice, and for reading my long-ass post."
3220,dcxp07,throwaway1248248,What to do about my mom not taking my potential OCD serious?,"**TL;DR** at the bottom if you don't have much time.

What I am writing here literally happened just minutes ago.

I was browsing reddit out of boredom, then I stumbled upon [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dcnq7e/what_is_an_odd_behaviour_of_yours_you_think_only/) post, I realized, that I experience many of these things myself, some guys commented under a thing, that I personally do as well, that this could be a symptom of OCD. Some weeks ago, I did an autism test with my best friend just for fun, turned out I am unlikely to have autism, I just told my mum and my sister about this test at lunch and they did one as well out of curiosity.  None of us are likely to have it, like I already expected. 

But lets get back to what happened today: I kinda  am into these psychological self tests(not these generic, are you an introvert or similar, but rather these like the autism or OCD tests) I found one online, (let me  know if you want to see the specific test) The scale was like this 0-7pts -&gt; OCD is unlikely; 8-11 -&gt; possible; 12+ -&gt; likely, I scored 25. I found the result pretty interesting and sent the test to my sister, she only got 2 points, however, she told my mom and she took a look at this test herself. The questions were a bit disturbing to her and she got quite concerned and talked to me about it. She thought, that it was only some puberty stuff, mind that I am 16. She began to tell how she had some of these thoughts about death herself when she was my age. I do often see images of death, etc. in my mind, these aren't really terrifying for me and I somewhat like thinking about it(sometimes). 

My mom thought at first, that I get these images from video games, I reassured to her, that the games I play don't involve death, which  is true! Then she began talking about movies, ok, so when I was way younger, I got pretty anxious from a scene in a movie, but now this is completely gone, my favorite movies are now heavily driven by violence and it doesn't scare me at all anymore. These images of  violence aren't bothering me. 

I randomly think about death and so an, for example, when I am standing at a balcony I think about what would happen, if I/we would fall off, the only thoughts, that really bother me , are when I start thinking about, what would happen, if I pushed someone off there, now I would NEVER do this, but I still have to think about it.  Or like every day, when I am at school, I think about what would happen, if a school-shooting occurred and I just think about a way of what I could do to defend the class room/ eliminate that guy. Or when I am walking along a street I am constantly looking for any kind of melee weapon, if someone was to attack me. There are many other examples, but I am cutting here, since I should already be in my bed and I don't want to be tired as hell tomorrow. I didn't particularly tell my mom about any of these, she continued saying, that I am fine and that she thinks, that this is because of me being very sensitive(I am very sensitive, but I don't think that this is the cause for my thoughts) I  realized, that I don't experience thoughts like I mentioned earlier, when I am distracted or at least less frequently(If that matters).

Another thing that I wanted to mention is the problem with ordering things, I always put my phone on the edge of my table and perfectly align everything else, because it makes me feel weird, if something lays off. I also count many things and feel the need to mirror events, like when I am scratch myself somewhere, I sometimes, have to repeat the same thing with my other had.

I want to note, that  I know, that you have to always take these self-test with a grain of salt, but this time I really feel like it could be right, my mom thinks the test is garbage because of the questions and she  got a pretty high score as well.

I am also  to anxious to tell her what some of  these thoughts really are(especially the ones involving family)

Sorry if this was difficult to read, I just got a pell-mell in my head and I had to let it out.

**TL;DR**: I experience symptoms of OCD, but my mom believes, that it is just a phase of puberty(I,m 16). What can I do now,  given this situation?"
24188,99eo0s,Joostski,How to explain to my parents I want to quit college and join the Air Force,"Hey, first post on reddit, I normally just lurk.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago I decided to go to college due to being pushed to do it, and to make my parents proud. This last year of classes I have been unhappy the whole time, but haven't told anyone. I've been thinking about quitting for the past few months and to join the Air Force instead. I've already spoken to a recruiter and found out I'm more then qualified to do what i'm interested in, other then being slightly underweight.

The issue I'm having is I went to college to make my parents proud, I don't want to quit and disappoint them, especially as they helped pay for it. My dad was in the Air Force as well but constantly tells me how proud he is of me going to school before starting work. He's in his mid 40s and is finishing his masters, and keeps reminding me he doesn't want this for me.

I have no clue how to bring this up to my parents, I was planing to today after work. I don't want to disappoint them and get kicked out, as I've always been told if I;m not in school I'll be kicked out. I'm 20 and I want to make my own decisions in life, but I don't want to let anyone down. At some points I've felt obligated to go to school for my parents as they are helping pay. 

Don't really know how well I worded my feelings, as I'm not the best at explaining. If anyone has any ideas on how I can bring this up to my parents and explain my reasoning, that would be great! "
39364,7jyara,xBTGx,Trouble with mentally wanting to get a drivers license,"Hi everyone,

I am currently 23 and live in a suburb of Philly. I went college in Massachusetts that had a great public transportation system and even lived in Dublin, Ireland for a semester where public transportation was my main means of getting places.

Even at the age of 16 and having a permit I had a hard time of even wanting to get my license. I was never in a bad accident so there is really no direct cause for this. Outside of school I didn't do much, as for a job I did work around my neighborhood throughout the year for money. 

As I'm now starting to get into a professional life and looking to being a career, I keep facing myself as my issues with not wanting to get a license. I've always felt that I had trust issues towards people on the road just because I don't believe they even know what they are doing most of the time. I also feel like I get distracted too easily while driving and I would seem to have a fear of something bad happening because of this. My parents always had SUVs and I never felt comfortable behind the wheel of them just because I felt they were to big and was in complete control.

The solution that I seem to believe in right now is with a smaller car like a small sedan (hell I've thought of a mini cooper) this might negate some of my fears and allow me to mentally accept driving.

Any input, advice, or personal experience would be greatly appreciated."

27406,8s6lqa,rtky1265,How to get over losing a friend due to choosing different life paths?,"
Hey Reddit I'm having a problem. My childhood friend doesn't want to know me. We used to be joined at the hip, we did everything together. We were both very hard working and I was very proud of her when she got into one of the country's top law university. Everything was fine until she met this guy who sponged off his parents and had never worked for anything in his life. My friend became very isolated not just from me, but from all of her other friends apart from one. When it came for everyone to go off to university she decided not to go last minute and instead move in with her boyfriend and his parents. Since then, she hasn't worked or gone into further study, hasn't made an effort to contact her friends or family (apart from the ones who clearly like her boyfriend) and has adopted a snobby-like attitude towards people who are achieving things for themselves (was told by the only mutual friend who is still in contact with her that she mocked me for getting a year long internship at university) .
I've tried my best to stay in contact. I've asked her how she has been and attempted to meet up with her on several occasions. A couple of months ago I came to the conclusion that I shouldn't keep trying to do this when she is clearly not interested and after messaging her last night with the last of my messages being left on read, I knew I was correct.
I'm upset over the fact she has changed so much. We have so many memories together. We grew up together and I'm disappointed she has chosen her boyfriend over her friends, family and individuality. I know that people change and we can't stay friends with everyone forever but how do I get over this? I know I shouldn't do this but I do blame myself for what has happened- maybe I should've done something? Any useful advice is welcome.
TLDR: Childhood friend clearly doesn't want me in her life, how do I get over this?

Note: Due to multiple reasons, I know this person is not being abused by her boyfriend."
3120,ddgsb4,Owenwilson666,How do I get over my doubt/insecurity in relationships?,"I (20f) have been dating my partner (26m)  for a bit over half a year, and we are living together. It was a decision that happened quickly in our relationship but made the most sense for us both financially and because of how we were feeling about each other. 

Overall, when I think about our relationship, it is great. It is better than I could have imagined for myself, he is supportive, caring, intelligent, and driven. He is loyal and dedicated and even though we have our issues he is always willing to work through them. 

For whatever reason though, I have recently found myself overcome with doubt about us. It’s a fixation at this point, almost every day I think “what if this doesn’t work out? What if how I feel is wrong and he’s going to hurt me eventually? What if he isn’t the ‘one’? Should I just end it so that I don’t get hurt? Why do I feel this way? Is this my intuition or just anxiety?” And it continues to spiral. 

For some background, I grew up with an alcoholic, mentally and physically abusive father. My main friend growing up would every year or so decide she didn’t want to be my friend any more, and would spread rumors among the friend group so that no one would talk with me, and then after a few months of isolation, allow me back into the group. I have been to therapy for years for all of these things, and live with depression and anxiety. 

I think that these feelings and thoughts are because of my anxiety and abandonment issues. I’m so used to people hurting me that I expect it at all times. I’m worried that I’m creating a self-fulfilling prophecy by feeling this way. 

How do I get over these feelings? Should I talk to my partner about this, or would that make things worse? It just builds and builds over time, and we talk about other things but I haven’t been able to bring up this feeling directly. I’m at a place where I realize that I am not feeling fulfilled with my life because I let go of what makes me happy and dont stay grounded and centered and in touch with myself. I struggle a lot with self love and acceptance, and plan on doing what I can to change those things, but this has been immensely distressing for me and I feel like I need to address it in order to move forward in my healing. 

Does anyone else struggle with feelings like these because of abandonment issues or something similar? Is this my intuition or my anxiety trying to self sabotage me? How do I let go of these feelings?"
325,dsjey9,Rose_Ariana,I keep attracting the weirdest people and I don't know why.,"For the last several years, I have been attracting the weirdest people. I could list so many examples.

This girl at the mall once came to me and told me she liked my shoes. I said thanks and she asked if she could take a picture of them. I was flattered and said yes. She gave me her instagram and I one day checked and saw she'd been posting that same picture of my shoes over and over again. It was so fucking weird.

Another guy once once emailed my sorority asking about me and one of my sisters. We thought it was a prank until we learned that you can trace IP addresses. It was a guy from my hometown 300 miles north of campus. And I also learned who it was one day at a family friend gathering when a 45+ year old guy - with no connection to my school or sorority - kept asking me about me and the same other girl. I straight said ""wait a minute, are you the guy who emailed us?"" and he said yes. It wasn't even anonymous.

I could list so many more stories like this. I really could.

I'm not claiming to be so attractive that people are trying to reach me left and right. It's quite the opposite. The people I want to attract, I actually have a hard time attracting. Many of the people whom I have wanted to date or be friends with have been really really busy and I've barely had the chance to get to know them. But weirdos come to me like flies to sugarcubes.

I don't know what it is about me that calls for this. That guy who emailed my sorority could have emailed anyone else's. I would have liked for him not to do this with anyone, but why me? Could it be that I give off subtle cues that I would likely be ok with this?

I know we're anonymous Redditors and you don't know me in person, but do you have any advice?"

13187,bxpzvq,Ttthhhrowaway154,Is there ever a good time to tell your parents you're not who they think you are?,"Let me start this off by making something abundantly clear: I love my parents. We have a semi healthy relationship and it's something I cherish. I'm very lucky to have all the support they've given me through the years... but... I'm not who they think I am.

Both of my parents are extremely religious and extremely Republican. I see nothing wrong with that, but they seem to think any other way of life leads you down a detrimental path. Like any kid, in my early years I held their beliefs as my own. That soon changed when I started high school though. As I learned more about the world from teachers, students, and many other people I started to sway from my parents traditional views. That was about 4 years ago. Now, I'm the exact opposite of how I was raised. I'm an agnostic liberal (I know, edgy teenager) who doesn't agree with their stance on many, if not all, political issues. 

This is where the advice comes in. I'm heading off to college soon. I'm attending a liberal arts college where the majority of students clearly lean away from the Republican side of things. Every time we've visited the college I'm reminded by my parents that ""Liberals will destroy this Earth"", ""All Liberals are heartless bastards that will burn in hell"", ""Now son, don't let this school change you. You wouldn't want to be a Liberal"". It's so disheartening to hear my parents talk this way about people like me. 

So, r/advice, is there ever a good time to confess my changed beliefs? If so, how? I'm genuinely terrified to find out how they'll react and what they'll do. I would honestly rather keep up the lie than tell them the truth, but I don't think it'll last much longer."
34196,80lbdh,throwawaygirl229,How to cope with being pregnant and alone?,"I’ve decided to keep this as short as I can. I (21) am pregnant with my (ex)boyfriend of 3 years’ child. In a matter of months I’ve became essentially jobless (long story) single and evicted from my apartment and being back to living at home with my mother. My boyfriend didn’t leave me however he is abusive towards me (not while I have been pregnant thankfully) and my entire family hates him so I’ve come to the realization that, for the sake of the baby, we cannot be together anymore. It’s the right thing for everybody but I still can’t help but feel saddened by it. I feel as though I’ve failed my child by giving her this man as a father, and failed at life in general. I can’t help but still want him even though he’s not a good boyfriend. He wants to be in the child’s life but my entire family is trying to get me to cut him out completely. 

Back story on the abuse; he has been violent towards me multiple times, although I’ve been told by a few people that I push people to want to inflict violence upon me. Idk. Doesn’t make his behavior right but I did push him (never hit him tho) and could have prevented it every time probably. Dude just has mental issues and anger issues. Never any serious injuries but enough to leave bruises and definitely frighten somebody in the moment. 

I love my baby and she is the only thing getting me through this but it’s still hard.

How do I deal with getting over this man who I shouldn’t even want to have anything to do with yet I do, dealing with the fact that I’ve failed my child by giving her a bad father and a broken home, and being pregnant and not having the baby’s father here with me to experience the joy of it? Also I have no idea how to deal with his involvement with the baby. I don’t believe he would harm her and it’s also not my right to take her father/his child away, but I still worry. I don’t want her going alone with him. Not to mention my family would be extremely unhappy with me if I let him in, even tho I’m an adult I can’t help but worry about their opinions. I do want my baby to have a father though.. "
1791,djxv9u,AACA23,Should I stop baking treats for my coworkers?,"I’m the new receptionist at my work for almost 6 months. I’ve been trying to make the front more inviting since most people avoid it like the plague. I brought in a keurig, which was on my desk for the past 3 months. It’s out of site from visitors and doesn’t take up much space since my desk is abnormally large. Then I started baking treats to bring in every week for everyone. I display them on a really nice cookie sheet and everyone can vote for these treats with a voting box I decorated. I’ve been doing this for over a month now. Lots of people have complimented me on everything I bring and have at the front desk and they praise the treats I make. It’s an exciting office thing now I guess. 

A few days ago, I got a call from my boss who said that I couldn’t have the keurig at my desk because someone might complain. I also needed to remove the voting box and I can’t use a cookie sheet to display the treats. She said she received a few complaints. I need to keep it more professional and if I wanted to continue to do this I need to get a nice tray to display everything and I needed to get a different voting box. I removed all the things my boss asked me to immediately. 

My boss was really nice about it but I know who was complaining about it. This person, let’s call them Stevie, has constantly had some problem with me. Stevie makes snide comments and talks down to me constantly. For example when I help her with stuff she says I’m doing it wrong in a demeaning way in front of everyone to embarrass me. Most of the time I wasn’t doing it wrong, she just decides she wants it done differently that day. I’m always very nice and helpful. Today she brought me a tacky plastic tray and a sign holder (which doesn’t help with voting) for me to use. She was being overly nice and was bothering me while I was trying to do my work. She seems to always do this right before or after she complains about me. 

I was deeply hurt by what happened. To the point I started crying at work. I couldn’t understand why it was a problem after doing this for over a month. I would understand in the first week or so. Anyway. Some of my coworkers are encouraging me to keep doing the treats and just roll with the punches. But I don’t think I can handle another issue if Stevie complains again."

Lastly what has cost me my last 3 jobs is not being able to sleep so i either just am a zombie at work doing awful or i sleep in too late and get fired for that. 

I cant even seem to get hired anymore the last 3 jobs i only got because of friends, even places like McDonald's and Walmart wont hire me, any advice?"
11623,c5nepw,imnidades,How do I kick someone out of a team?,"This post could also be ""How to fire someone?"" but we're in college.  I have a group thesis and we're 4 members total. The thesis spans 2 semesters (so it's like thesis 1 and 2) and this one person hasn't been pulling their weight since thesis 1. He wouldn't respond to messages, his outputs weren't up to standard, we meet 8 hours a week to work together whereas he only comes in 4 hours a week. We tried to be understanding with meeting up because we can work over the internet but how can he work over the internet when he doesn't respond to message. He doesn't even try to make effort to communicate or offer to help. I've pulled him aside once before to talk about his communication but not much has come up. I IG storied a passive aggressive story about ""being useless"" and he sent the group chat a very insincere 'apology' or 'excuse'. I showed my therapist and some friends and they agreed that that wasn't sincere. We wrote him back messages and he didn't even see them for days. He started responding to one of us and doing a bit more work now but he's acting like nothing happened. Also there's not much work for him to do because we're near the end of the thesis. It's like 90% complete.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my thesis advisor and the dean said we have to call with him tomorrow. We have to tell if we'll kick him out or give him a chance. The thesis advisor will be there to mediate. 2 of us feel like we should just kick him out. We already carried him through thesis 1 (with the highest grade in our batch!) so that's enough.

&amp;#x200B;

My 2 groupmates are shy so I usually do the talking for us but it's just, where do I begin? How do I start this conversation? I just want to be professional about this. I'm worried about laughing or crying out of nervousness. I've never had to stand up for myself before."

36491,7sv2bv,typicaljay,I think I am getting bullied at college. Please help.,"Hello, reddit, I am a college freshman. Currently I am attending a local community college. School life was ok, until this guy recommended me to take an online class with him. He just recommended me because this class is pretty easy class and I thought it would be ok to take it with him. I was not thinking of doing collab with him, because I always study alone unless there is a lab for my lab science courses. Anyway, at some point, he literally forced me to collab with him. I accepted it, but I started to feel like I am getting bullied. I set up all the clients for the online course (we have to install a certain program to take that course). Not only that, I was pretty much forced to send every quiz answers, although grading policies were ridiculously forgiving. I told him that I don't think it is not ok to share the answers. A week later, he said, as a compensation, he will give me all the homework and essay from the other courses that he took. I was going to say no thanks, but I felt like I had to take it because there was no way to escape this however. Later on that day, I told him that ""it's ok not give me the other courseworks that you've done. Let's not cooperate and let's not share the answers as well. I do not need your works and I can handle these by myself. And, If I copy all of your works, what's the point of taking those classes then? I don't think I will be picking up anything from that course. Even if I transfer into 4-yr college successfully, I don't think I will survive at all. And according to what you have said, this is your last semester. Why don't you do it by yourself then? You won't have any problem transferring outta here? No offense, but let's not collab at all."" And he started to yell cuss at me said ""You are pretty damn good at making an innocent person look like a demon. You listen to what I say and answer property you fucking faggot. (Yes, he literally said this.)."" And since that day, he's been calling me a few times a day and this is giving me an anxiety. Similar thing happened for psychology as well. He (same person) suggested me to cheat on it, so I was going to drop it, but he bullied me just because I was not willing to cheat on that course. And then I dropped it, then later on he apologized to me. Now this does not work. It's his last semester, I don't even know campus police's gonna take this issue seriously. According to him, he thinks I am obligated to follow his ""order"" just because I am younger than him. What do I do now? I can't even sleep because of him. Recently I received a phone call from him at 11 -ish pm. Please help 

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 1 - I reported him to the school deans. Not only that, I am willing to send a written discrimination complaint letter to the district as well. I was not going to send the written letter, but he kept calling me middle of the class. This is actually traumatizing. I've never thought of visiting safe space in my life. I had to stay in the school's safe space for quite awhile because he is literally camping in the library for 24/7. 

tl;dr - Currently attending a local community college. Taking an online course with a guy. Constantly bullies me whenever I refuse to collab with him. 

ps - scantly typed this. Please understand grammatical / structural errors. 

edit - minor grammatical errors / added Day 1.

Also due to my baggage I took childish actions 2 years ago and broke up with my true love because I couldn’t deal with our problems on top of my feelings of worthlessness. She comes from an oppressive society which made it difficult for her to be with me because they don’t allow sex till marriage there, and we were having sex but she was never able to truly feel comfortable. I made her feel like shit because I was childish and stupid and impulsive. I broke up with her, while we both knew neither of us wanted it it seemed like the only option. We remained best friends. Our connection is deep. About 6 months after that, someone asked her out and we were still a maybe, but I tried to be selfless for her when we asked if she should go out with him. They broke up a few weeks later because of more of my childish actions and it hurt everybody. Because of me. I moved to a different city and we started to lose closeness, even though we still love each other. But I recently found out after a year she has been dating the person from before and I feel like shit, like I lost her.

10690,caaega,whosmansisthis24,Attention law enforcement officers of reddit. I Think my FIL is impersonating a officer I want to find out for my MIL sake.,"So i mean absolutely no disrespect and i am EXTREMELY thankful of you guys but im certain something wrong.

Recently me and my fiancee moved back in with her side of family and her FIL is a police officer (street) or so he claims. The reason i am doubting this is the SHEER amount of time he has off.  I am familier with the fact that they get extra time off if they work a holiday but ive only seen him work 1 easter, a new years and a memorial day. Hes been a cop for 3 years and i he has took of atleast 8 months of that time off in month/2 week intervals. This isint even talking about the random day here and there he takes off for any excuse he can come up with. For example he just had a whole 3 weeks off of ""holiday time"" went back to work one day and already took his next 2 days off. Btw i know how they have split weeks and how they have 12 hr shifts and shift change is 7 ( i know this because a friend of mines dad works the city next to mine and all shift changes are the same here)

Theres several reasons besides ALL the time off he has.
1)  He used to leave the house at 530 to get there on time now he leaves at 6:20 which is strange
  2) he once left the house and was gone from 6-11 and popped back up because he forgot his gun
3)i walked in on him selling sun screen over the phone.
4) he is ""the boss of his castle"" so my MIL questions none of this and says ""i trust him"" 
5)she is not in charge off the finances so that makes me think hed be able to move money around and make it seem like hes getting paid. My MIL is super nice and makes 50 something an hour so shes the bread winner because. I know police do not make as much as they deserve she commented about how ""he doesent make much but hes always wanted to be a cop""

I know hes capable of lying and has lots of narcissistic tendancies because 5 years before me amd my fiancee got togethor he was having an affair with the lady at the church he was working at  (thats another thing, he hates work. My MIL has mentioned several jobs hes had that ""werent what he thought is going to be. He also had a whole meltdown where me and my fiancee and newborn moved out for a week do to the fact that he took a month off work to cut down trees and had a 4 man crew but was screaming at my fiancee because we didint help with the trees the weekend he finally decided to cut down after taking 30 days off because she was getting induced friday and we were setting up all the baby stuff and getting set up as new family.

I really want my MIL to know the truth because she is a very sweet lady but i know she is naive and doesent pay attention to whats going on

Im sorry if this post is crazy to read. Im on mobile and scatterbrained connecting a bunch of dots.

Once again i have nothing but respect for law enforcement officers i just want to know the truth. My friend who works in the jail is the one who put the idea into my head after always hearing about my FIL always being off and saying ""that guy cant be a cop"""

Neither my mom or my sister helped me when I was younger and got bullied in school and high school or when I was stressed for some work it was always my friends and some teachers that helped me, I'd that's why I have extreme anxiety, but look!

Honestly I don't know what to do, I've been patience all my life and I always swallowed their bs and be like “ok, it doesn't affect me”, talked to them on how they hurt me and how we could change and they don't give a sh*t, talked to my father to help me (they are divorced) and all he does is give me “God advices” which is useless he is an adult and could be helping but instead he is a workaholic, I'm not very religious but I swear, I've prayed like a million times to God to end all of this bs, help my mother or do something, if he exists he seem like the most useless thing on existence, things are still the same since I have memory.

We had done long distance for one year of our high school but he's already expressed the distance being too hurtful. My parents and 2 siblings are all I've got making me stay as I feel my time with them is limited before they go back to their home country, I'm not certain leaving Minnesota for (as everyone sees it) a guy would be in my best interest. The toss up is that I am not very certain about which direction I'd like to go for schooling, although it is cheaper in FL. I'm extremely indecisive(100x more than women normally are) and I see positives in both.Minnesota hits everyone with seasonal depression and the sunshine state would be lovely. I'm also Latin so I'd be able to experience my culture better than in the midwest. One thing people keep telling me is that it's over-saturated and difficult to find a job.

He’s helped me through all my hard times but i’ve always felt like he’s used me for money whether it was for food or alcohol or for my house to sleep at. I’ve never really felt like i was as great of a friend to him as other people and like that i was just there when he wanted something yet he always told me i was.  On a few occasions he’s pushed me to a point where i’ve wanted to stop being friends with him cause of how much he takes the piss out of me or lets me down but he always manages to be nice enough to me to make me feel like i’ve meant something to him when low key i don’t think i do.

Well recently we went to this party and i got too drunk and passed out at pres and he decided to put gum in my hair and cut it. I had no idea he was doing any of it and when i got to the party i realised how shit it was. My hair was patchy. Some parts were at a level 1 shave and some was as long as it was before. So i decided to shave it all off just in an attempt to look a bit  better and while still being very drunk i asked my other mate to shave it with a size 2 shaver and there he was again taking off the size 2 and making the other guy shave my head with a 1. 

The whole walk home i was depressed and just wanted to know who cut it and who stuck the gum in my hair and he continued to tell me that it wasn’t just him and that multiple people did it. It wasn’t till the next day that one of my other mates let me know that he was the only person to put gum in my hair and cut it.

He’s not the most well off kid he lives with his mum and lives in a house about the size of my living room. He always manages to convince me that it was somehow my fault or that its not as bad as something is, depending on the situation. I honestly want to shave his head back in frustration but now that i’ve been typing this i think it might be a jealousy thing because i’m a bit better off than him and was about a 7 with hair compared to him being about a 5. I honestly dont know what to do in this situation, he’s so funny to be around and always manages to make me smile, but then he goes and does this shit that makes me feel shit and just unwanted.

So i’m looking to you guys to help me.
What should i do?"
12711,c013cs,CourageousLiquids,Elderly In-Laws need help with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Kid!,"Backstory: My wife's parents are in their late 70s.  All of the kids had moved away and about 10 years ago they decided they were going to foster children.  To date, they have fostered 60+ kids and they've only ever had one rule and that is that they would only foster kids less than 2 years old because it's easy for them to manage feeding, diaper changes, and dropping off at daycare, and not as easy to discipline or chase a kid around. My FIL doesn't sleep very regularly, so it wasn't a big deal for him to take care of night feedings or crying.  
   
 Most kids would cycle through to the parent after they had gotten their act together or to a family member that was finally notified and would become the legal guardian after so much time in foster care. Except for two children.  My in-laws at the age of 70-something decided to adopt two 2-year olds (unrelated to each other).  My wife has a brother (no kids) and a sister (3 kids).  The brother and his wife both said early on they would be responsible for the girl. She's very nice and essentially they care for her 24/7/365 now.  


This brings me to the boy (now 6 or 7 years old).  He's very hard to manage. Whenever we visit for holidays with our children, he's always fighting. He gets hyper upset on the drop of a dime.  My MIL is a saint and very easy going. My FIL only has one way to deal with anger and that's to scream and spank.  The type of behavior that shuts down the entire house whenever everybody's around.  He has no patience for the boy.  The boy has fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and from the research I've done from reading about it, every box that can be checked off about fetal alcohol syndrome symptoms has gotten checked off.  A 6-year old literally ran away on Christmas day. He doesn't know the area at all, but he just went and we found him a half of a mile away.  The mom took some of the kids for a walk and the 6-year old took off and being 70-something years old and having a few other kids with her, she couldn't chase him. She brought the kids back home and then all of us went on the hunt. He's extremely stubborn. He's gotten suspended from school leading to expulsion. He's bitten teachers and principals. He just doesn't give a fuck.  Other than the father having zero patience, the mom makes so much effort into providing a nice life for the boy: karate classes, soccer team, boy scouts, school. She tries very hard.    


This leads me to a text I read this afternoon from my SIL to my wife (who used to be a social worker) Paraphrased because I'm not reading the text to say something along the lines of: ""Do you know of any group homes for BOY? Mom is having a very hard time with BOY.""

  
More backstory: I have seen this exact scenario coming around the bend since the day they said they were going to adopt. FAS or not, two seventy somethings raising a 2 year old and being in their early 90s when he's going through high school was not a smart idea and they essentially were adopting children on their biological children's behalf.  NONE of the biological children would commit to adopting the boy because they all have their own family and even at 2 years old, they knew he was challenging. As part of the adoption process, they had to get somebody to sign a letter saying that they would be backup guardians should something happen.  Those folks have bailed.   


I'm so angry. I'm angry at the in laws for putting the rest of the family in this situation and I'm angry at all of the siblings not willing to talk about the giant FAS elephant in the room.  Up until reading all about FAS, I had told my wife that we should take him (we have a 2 children ourselves), but it would have to be soon to get him away from the never ending cycle of shit that is my FIL. But then I read all about FAS and it turns out I had an acquaintance that was 70 years old and had adopted an FAS child when he was younger and I changed my mind.  


What are our options? I have no idea what to do.     We only visit them twice a year and my wife only speaks to them once every month or so and the stories keep getting worse and worse.  This can't continue like this."

Even if I was further away, our eyes met. It was all fun with her, and the last day we walked to the train station together, and at the end I was like 'hey, do you feel like doing something fun soon?' (not in a weird way), and she was like 'Yea, sure! (smiling and enthusiastic)' and then we went our separate way (I would contact her soon).

10243,ccod1a,CheesyDutch,How do I respond to the suicide attempt from a friend?,"This is not the first time, she's had depression for years now. 

A bit of history, we actually met through our depression online about 8 years ago. I got better and am very happy nowadays, she still struggles every day. At first that was fine, I could relate to her and we really helped each other. But the  feeling of black despair, those memories have faded for me and I can't really tell what she needs from me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

We usually talk through whatsapp and we can say anything to each other. The last six months her condition has gotten worse, she has done several serious suicide attempts, she was found on time and brought to a hospital every time, now it has gotten even more frequent and I've gotten a message that she's in the hospital again.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to respond anymore. She has a team of professionals around her and is on medication but nothing ever seems to help. I feel like I've reacted in so many different ways I'm repeating myself now. My reactions don't feel sincere anymore and I feel like I'm giving up on her. This is of course not something I want her know or notice, so what is the best message I can send her now after this attempt? I hope reddit can help me out here!"

24203,99axdj,InMyFeelings19,I can’t talk to any of my friends about this so I’m going anonymous to ask you for help about my relationship,"So this is probably the only post I’m going to place on this account. I just want advice and can’t get this idea out of my head. Essentially, this girl and I have been friends for 3 years now. She is a year older than I am. She had transferred to my school when I was in grade nine. We have both mutually had on and off feelings toward each other but have never acted upon it. When she was about to graduate grade 12, we began to date. I didn’t know how serious this relationship was going to be. I thought maybe it would be a summer thing or something. I quickly grew attached to her and it was unbelievable how much we love each other. We have grown to the point where we know that we want to marry each other in the future. Now I know that if I were to get married to anyone it would be this girl. It has only been a three months and it is almost time for her to leave to university. She is headed up to a university that is 4 hours away and I’ll probably only be able to see her twice a week. Now the real issue I have. She has had a “interesting past”. I am just going to be blunt about everything from this point on. She was a hoe. She easily fell in and out of love. Thinking hook ups were real and what not. Now, I understand everyone has a past but I can’t bring myself to accept this fact. We have talked about it and the only thing that she can tell me is that she has changed. If I were to honestly continue and explain the whole story, it would take pages. What I’m getting at is that I feel like she will cheat on me. I don’t know why I get this feeling. I have suppressed this feeling multiple times in the past but it just has been flourishing this week. Please, anyone’s opinions are helpful. If you can, and I would really appreciate it, dm me so I can provide a more in depth story so you could fully understand.

14094,btf55u,Sharpless104,Harassment through phones. What to do to stop it?,"Harassment through phone calls and text? I as well as my other family have experienced calls being listened to for no reason. Calls forwarded to my phone. People would call my mother's number and it would be forwarded to my phone when I am on my own plan I pay for. Phone calls from all types of real numbers. Calls cut when I try to talk to someone about it. Things became worse when I received a text from my father that was not him at all. But came through as his number.

&amp;#x200B;

It first started happening to my mother. They got new phones, didn't help. They changed their numbers. Didn't help.  Then when I spoke to my mother about this situation over the phone it started happening to me. Almost as soon as I acknowledged that it was really happening since some odd things happened to me that I mentioned. Started being called from weird numbers I don't know. Answered the phone once and some guy was obviously trying to scare me and then hung up. I didn't believe my mother. Now I do of course. I started ignoring it and getting some security apps on my phone to make sure I am not being tapped into or whatever. It seems to stop, the calls and such become less when I ignore it all. But my mom and dad got to the point of not using their phones. My mother is hysterical over it. Maybe that is why it persists so much for her? Who ever this is is getting a thrill out of my mother losing it over this happening to her.. Perhaps?

She was the first person in years I could say that I loved. Except, this time I actually felt something different. I felt for the first time, unconditional fucking love. It made me happy to see her happy. It made me happy to know that she knew that I loved her. It made me happy when she’d tell me she loved me too. 

It felt so fucking real. I was willing to put my heart on my sleeve for this girl. I never once wanted anything in return.

Then came the day she moved away. We would only be able to see each other like once a week if we made plans. The night after she moved we had a really intimate text conversation in which I told her how much I loved her and stuff and she replied with her cute replies.

The day after, she stopped talking to me without explanation. It’s been a week since. I’ve just felt so fucking empty. I’d sent her small texts to attempt to initiate a conversation but she’d only one worded replies and in general, didn’t seem interested anymore. It’s gone to the point that as I’m writing this, I’ve decided to stop trying. She obviously isn’t interested anymore. I’ve been trying to forget about her but it’s so fucking hard.

We are both married, no children, and we both have three dogs.  Also, we are both plus size. I was closer to her size when I met her but recently over the last year I’ve dropped quite a bit of weight and sizes. We have some similarities but more differences. My husband and I get along with her husband, no questions asked. A lot of the times when she is out of town her husband will come over here and have dinner with us, have some beers with us, watch a movie, just hang out. Other times when she has been out of town he invites us over to do the same at his house or some other activity. We have gone out as a couple a few times but I feel like there’s a big elephant in the room. She is a very different person than I’m used to dealing with on a personal level. I wouldn’t pick her to be my friend but I try to stay as neighborly friendly as possible but she is always acting annoyed, or makes gestures at her husband like “I’m over this. Let’s go”.  &lt;—- mid sentence while I’m talking. Something I feel like saying something like “do you realize I can see you? That’s rude”. I don’t say anything because I don’t wanna start any drama. If it wasn’t for her nice husband, I couldn’t care less if we ever interacted with them. I tried talking to her on personal level one on one and it went south quickly. She was on her phone 97% of the time I was talking to her. Fast forward to the next week, I texted her and she never ever responded. I asked her a question about the dates she needed me to watch her dogs. Nothing.  I ended up asking her husband to get me the information and you better believe maybe five minutes after he got home I got a response from her.  Her husband hangs out with us alone pretty often. My husband and I privately talk about how she’s always gone, how he complains about her, and we wonder what’s really going on next-door. We don’t really ask any questions when my neighbor is telling us stuff, we just listen and give advice where it fits. Personally, I feel like she is selfish, and just needed financial assistance in order to live in a beautiful brand new home.  She’s constantly interrupting him when he speaks, she can’t ever be wrong, she has an Instagram account as a blogger and fashionista 😳. She brags about being sponsored by companies and all the perks from being a “public figure”. I sit back and observe her and I’m trying to figure out why all of that is so important to her instead of her husband. I would never put social media, sponsorship, driving 7 hours to meet a celebrity, or anything of that matter in front of my husband. I would like to know how you all would handle this situation.

4102,d88x0u,anonymous095674,I cheated in college and feel very guilty now.,"Hi, so I made mistakes. I cheated in college, and I feel very guilty about it now. Let me tell you what is going on with me right now. Long post ahead.

So, it is in physics class at a community college. Originally, I was doing it legitimately, and I was doing ok. (I had to do worksheets, in-class quizzes, online quizzes, exams, and lab reports.) However, my online quiz grade was struggling. I would not do it open book or look online for the answers. Same for my worksheets. Worksheets were like homework that the students can work together on. Mostly, I would be getting help from others who were picking up the material faster than I was.

Eventually, near the end of the semester, I ask the professor if the online quiz was open-book and such. He said yeah, since he cannot stop the students from using it. So I saw myself as sabotaging my grades. I asked some fellow students what they did, and some said that they even googled stuff online for the quiz. One of the those students was one I worked with on worksheets and labs. So, I started using the book and even googling the answers to some of the questions on the online quiz. The main stuff the professor worried about was the in-class quizzes and the exams, so I did not see myself in the wrong.

I pass the class, and Physics II is next. Now, I saw myself knowing what strategy I had to do in order to get past my professor's (horribly taught class in my opinion. Seriously, a lot of students hate how he ""teaches."" He doesn't really teach, and he grades harshly too.) class. So, for worksheets, when I was really unsure of what to do, I would google the problem online, and sometimes find the exact same problem with someone else solving it step by step. I would use it. For online quizzes, I found Quizlet, which had all the questions on those quizzes with the correct answer. So, what I would do is answer the question first, see if I got it right, and if I did not, I would change it. As a result, I would get perfect scores on the online quizzes. I thought I was in the right.

I passed the physics class, because I did well by legitimately doing well on the exams and in-class quizzes. I got an A (even though according to my calculations I should have got a B still). Now, I messed up my transfer and I end up taking another semester at the community college. To complete some major courses, I am taking Physics III (I am a computer science major). I started to do the same practices on the worksheet until it occurred to me, isn't this wrong? I googled what cheating was, and I realized yeah, I am in the wrong here. In fact, if the dean were to see these behaviors without any context of the professor, I could get suspended or expelled! So, for one problem I left what I found online since I mostly was on the right track, just forgot a detail, but for the other problem, I left it as what I had, and I got it completely wrong. So, I ask the professor if it was okay to use sources such as Chegg or Quizlet even if they have the questions and answers of the worksheets and online quizzes, and he said it was fine if I was learning. Despite that, I felt a huge amount of guilt. I read about one timers cheating on exams, but me, I did that for many problems on worksheets and all my online quizzes of the past semester! I felt extremely awful that I did this, and I am ashamed that my conscious kicked in after I did it multiple times. Instead of studying like a hard working student, I took the lazy and unethical route, and I violated what I originally stood for. I am a mess.

So, now I wake up with this guilt gnawing at me from the back of my mind as I try to do things more legitimately in my classes. This guilt caused me to think about what I possibly did wrong years back. This guilt caused me to think about what I did in my online classes 5 years ago (I was concurrently enrolled in the college at the time), where I treated them as always open-book (which they could have been, but I do not know for sure, and probably never will.). I also feel guilty for this one time in a computer class where I shared most of my code to a student who was struggling in hopes that he would learn from it. He didn't, so I stopped myself. Thankfully, the professor didn't seem to mind since the homework can be worked together in groups, so I do not feel as guilty for this. I talked to my mother about this, my step father, and my brother, and they all think I should move on from this and to stop thinking about it, while not doing it again. But my mind simply won't. I asked my God to forgive me, and to give me peace so I can get through my day, but this guilt hasn't been completely eliminated. Now, this is where I am, still asking God what I should do about this while trying to get through my Physics III class legitimately. However, the professor changed things up that made the grading even harsher, so now while trying to be legitimate, if I make one mistake, I already get a 75% on the assignment.

Now, I ask the reddit for advice. I have heavily considered if I should confess to the professor, but if I do that, I am afraid that my academic career is over, and my hopes of being a computer scientist are destroyed. I would probably have to work retail for years before something good happens, while feeling ashamed of myself. If I confess and the professor decides to report me, and while I may feel less guilt about what I did, I probably will feel guilty later that I blew my chance to change things while I was still in the system. I constantly put shame onto myself for being a 3.9 GPA student in phi theta kappa that did such unethical actions. I am trying to leave the past in the past, since I have a tendency to overly beat myself up over smaller things (but this time, it definitely isn't small).

Reddit, what is your advice? Christians, what do you think I should do? Any advice is appreciated."
26451,8xefay,stop_beinganidiot,"I’m incredibly arrogant and it’s ruining my life, I’m looking to change","I use arrogance as a coping mechanism for the fact I hate myself and the way I live. I spend almost all my time alone as a social recluse and am afraid of trying any new things. I’m incredibly dishonest with everyone about almost everything about myself because I have an incessant need to pretend I’m not as fragile and pathetic as it might appear.

I’m here, because I’m sick of this.

I don’t want advice on how to change my mindset, it’s a good thought but it won’t work, I know it won’t work because I’m too stubborn to let words affect me. I need advice on action to take. Im willing to grit my teeth and try anything, but I’m so close minded I can’t think of a single good idea of ways to get out of this self piteous loop I live in.

I have 3 (real) friends. 2 of which I get incredibly bothered by. I get bothered by them because I consider them less “cool” than me. This is obviously my arrogance talking, as I’m not cool at all, I’m just very good at pretending I am. One of these friends, I get this itching feeling whenever I’m with them that I don’t want anyone to see me with them, due to this profile I’ve built through my life as someone who wouldn’t be hanging out with someone like them, but when we’re alone I do genuinely enjoy their company.

My final friend I adore. I adore her because she’s a social butterfly who goes places and does things that seem like so much fun to me, but I think I wouldn’t enjoy them because I’d probably overthink all of it and have a bad time. Or at least that’s what she thinks, so she’d never take me along with her.

I hope this is a good view into how shallow I am, it might seem like these facts make me a bad person, but I don’t think I am. I’m able to honestly admit these flaws and I want help overcoming this, because this has all sent me into a horribly isolated depressive lifestyle. It may be quite obvious what I should do to some, but I just want to hear it from someone else, as I have little enough self confidence to not trust anything I think.

Please help me change my life for the better.

Not only that but he also said that if my dad took his severance whenever my dad tries to apply at a new job, if they call this school, the headmaster is going to say that they fired him and 'wouldn't re hire him again'. My dad is really stressed out at the moment and not sure what to do. He's 50 at this point and employers these days don't like hiring people above the age of 40 no matter how much bullshit they say about not discriminating against age or race or sex. 

My mom is a computer science professor but she her contract lasts two more years (she had to work there because she got a 'government scholarship' which is basically indentured servitude) and if she leaves now she'll have to pay back a large sum of money (50k+). 

My parents are really conflicted and don't know what to do at the moment. I have two younger brothers and we've lived in this country all our life so moving is not going to be some small hurdle that we come across. Any advice at this point is appreciated."
33157,83x6ub,midtwentydirtbag,26 and still unsure what to do with my life / can’t let go of my childhood,"Hello everyone, so as the title says I’m going through a little bit of a “quarter life crisis” here. I’m hoping to get some advice from people who are my age, or have just been in my situation, or are older, more experienced; hell anyone really lol

So recently, I turned 26, and I am totally unhappy with where I am in life / totally scared for my future. I currently work at a bank (nothing fancy, just basically a teller with some other responsibilities mixed in), and I absolutely hate it. I hate the business model, the shallow socializing, pretty much everything.  Due to this (which I acknowledge is my own fault), I have no hope of being promoted (not like I’d really want to, anyway). 

On top of working full time, I am currently enrolled in school full time, pursuing a bachelors in Economics.  I already had an associates degree (Liberal Arts) that I got right out of high school, so I transferred in as a second half sophomore.  Originally, I had planned to continue onto law school (something I had flirted with in the past), but after noticing the abysmal job market, I decided to shelve that idea for now. 

Since I’m majoring in economics, I’m learning about data analysis and the like, which seems pretty interesting to me, but the way I entered into my present school I’m missing internship opportunities going into the summer, but even if wasn’t, I wouldn’t be able to take advantage of them anyway - due to me already having a full time day job - and needing the money I make from said job to pay the bills.  I also find it hard to quit this job because admittedly, the benefits and pay are decent for someone with my experience (which is not much).  This makes me stress even more because I feel like I’m missing out on experience that I will need with future jobs regarding my degree while wasting away here. So all this just leaves me feeling stuck. 

I also keep reverting back to childhood activities of mine - playing old video games (Pokemon, Diablo 2, CS 1.6) and rereading old books (Harry Potter), watching old shows (Dragon Ball, Jackass, Viva La Bam, etc). I haven’t thought much of this up until now, but I’ve recently realized that I probably do this to cope with my current issues - which makes me feel even worse. 

I feel lost and unsure. I see people like my S/O, 
majoring in something she loves and is on track to getting a job in a field she loves, while I have nothing that interests me as much.  I’m so happy for her, but I feel so upset with myself. 

I’ve tried to make it a point to make changes in my life (for example, as mentioned, I enrolled in school and I’m actually doing really well for once), but no matter what I do I don’t feel any closer to being content with my life.  I basically feel like a huge loser. 

Has anyone else felt like this and seen the light? Is there any glaring improvement opportunities with the limited information I provided you guys see? Any and all help is appreciated - nice stuff, tough stuff - anything. Thank you. 

P.S. didn’t realize how long this was lol, so extra thanks to everyone who made it this far"
19409,b1n33h,AppyPitts06,Insane school anxiety,"Took my first class in a couple of years, failed the pretest (like 2 out of 70 fail), and absolutely lost it. Shaking, trouble breathing, torrential sobbing, all of it. How the fuck do I get over my school anxiety?

14293,bsnk6w,goddessmayari,Is there any way I can get a breast reduction surgery cost reduced or covered through insurance? (US),"I got 99 problems and my huge tits are the main two that cause the rest. Seriously, they’re huge. And they’re causing back, shoulder, neck pains, migraines, etc that I feel I should not be experiencing as a 24 year old in otherwise alright health. 

They started growing bigger when I was in high school and I feel like they just haven’t stopped. It’s gotten to the point where I stopped doing martial arts because the uniform wouldn’t cover my cleavage and I felt really uncomfortable. I have to stretch out my back countless times in a day because it just HURTS. 

I’m interested in getting a reduction, but my work insurance doesn’t cover breast reduction and a good surgeon where I live will charge up to $20k, which I also don’t have. 

Are there alternatives? I’d go to a different country if I had to. At the very least, is there a way to convince insurance companies to cover the cost of surgery?"

23095,9esjz6,xX_Metal48_Xx,I’m trying to get a dorm for college but my parents are intentionally fucking me over.,"Hello guys. I am in the twelfth grade and have just turned 18, and will be graduating with honors from my high school. I want to get a dorm at the colleges that I’ll be attending. Problem is, my parents don’t want me to and are actively fucking me over and acting like they aren’t doing anything. 





Before I get into anything else, I’d like to give you a little insight into my home life. (**If you don’t want to read it skip ahead to the last two paragraphs**) I fucking hate it. I have to share a room with my brother. I swear the only reason that little shit was conceived was to make my life hell. He eats fucking EVERYTHING, and he does it for fun. I play soccer at school, and usually I’ll store leftovers in the fridge to eat after practice or before/after a game. My food is always fucking gone. I can’t do shit to make him stop because my parents protect him. I can’t even raise my voice at the little cunt lest the iron fist quickly strikes me down. He’s constantly making some kind of noise or running around that house shaking a book between his fingers, so I literally cannot do homework or anything else requiring quiet inside my own parents’ house. He lies, cheats, steals, tries to annoy people for fun, and even dabbles in bullying. One time a girl that he was bullying went directly to my dad to tell him what a little shitstain my brother was being. My mom convinced my dad not to do anything because the girl “knew who to go to to get him (my brother) in the most amount of trouble” (referring to my dad’s well-known reputation of being a disciplinarian). He got away scot-free. The kicker? He’s fucking 12. In seventh grade. 




The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. My parents are a special case. Manipulative, borderline abusive, narcissistic, the whole package. My mom spends her time playing the victim and then throwing tantrums akin to a child’s if that card doesn’t work, and my dad is also special. He’s from the Caribbean (so is my mom) and absolutely despises Trump and Republicans in general, but he’s the most conservative person I know. Hates gays, thinks that everything that he dislikes/disagrees with is bullshit, thought process stuck somewhere in the early nineties, fell for MLM bullshit and is now enjoying his boxes of “natural” essential oils, toothpastes, and lotions, the whole entire package plus additional religious DLC that causes his behavior to become erratic based on his love of religion (“What do you mean you just came from soccer practice two hours ago and just want to unwind? It’s a Friday evening! You have to be at a church service that barely has an average attendance of 15 over the past 5 years and none under the age of 25!”






I’m not allowed to go anywhere with friends because according to them every kid is a smoking drinking lowlife who’ll peer pressure you into doing the same. They’ve made sure that I can’t go out anyways with the Friday evening church services mentioned above (none of my friends’s churches have Friday evening services) and some bullshit that they need help with on weekends and holidays. I used to play soccer and was one of the top 10% of players in America in all four of my positions, playing for one of the best academies in my state. If I kept at it, I would probably be living it large under a professional contract with a big European club right now. Of course, my parents pulled me out one day due to missing church services on Sundays. So I eventually picked up videogames. Even though I’m really good and make a bit of money on the side, with these type of parents everything’s wrong with videogames, whether it be the “violence” or the “waste of time”. When I am playing, suddenly there’s a whole laundry list of things to do in the house that requires me to get up immediately to go take care of. I can never just relax. My parents expect me to have my nose buried in a book 24/7, doing nothing else. They won’t let me get a normal job, only giving me the option of working 9 hours at my dad’s job on Saturdays for a grand total of 20 fucking dollars. For 9 hours. Once in a while they’ll buy me something super expensive (the most recent one being an iPhone 8+ in August that I’m typing this in right now), and then use that as justification for their bullshit. Recently my dad has been putting pressure on me to put my name on his bank account, effectively having a joint bank account with him. I’ve also been studying the stock market and how it works, which is one of the few things that still brings me joy, and now he wants a joint stock portfolio account, too. I know that if I say yes to either they’ll be able to control me financially, too but I have no reason to say no.







Living in this house is slowly killing my sense of self. I used to be absolutely crazy for soccer, never missing an F.C. Barcelona game. I used to dream of one day stepping on the Camp Nou pitch in the blue and red-striped jersey. Not anymore. I had to force myself to watch the recent Champion’s League draw. I used to love going to school, but ever since my parents started breathing down my neck every time my grades dipped slightly below an A, I just could care less. My grades haven’t been the best in high school and I know I could be a top academical student if I would put more effort, but I just could care less. I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD, but when I wold my mom that I wanted a test for it at my yearly doctor’s check up, she threatened to not bring me at all. I’m not depressed, but I feel like I may be soon if I keep living in this house. 






Now back to the main story. As I said before, I’m trying to move to a dorm. As soon as my parents caught wind of that, they started to do everything in their power to stop it. My dad drives me to school, and now every time he does so I get a story about some guy who moved to a dorm, flunked out, and then got busted for being part of a sex-trafficking ring. How his arrest or even his flunking out of school had anything to do with him living in a dorm is beyond me. How in his experience, only two kids out of ten who went to go live in dorms actually graduated and went on to get a good job. Also, I’ve decided that in Saturdays, I would try and learn to cook food at home so I wouldn’t have to survive on Ramen like other kids and do other household chores such as using the washing machine. Suddenly, my dad needs help at his business on Saturdays even though he managed just fine for years when I played travel soccer on Saturdays. My parents were also planning on buying me a car, but once they heard that I was going to a dorm, they gave me an ultimatum, either going to school from home and getting a brand new Dodge Charger or living in a dorm and not having a car, but still expecting me to somehow visit them every weekend.







How can I get out of this place? Every second I’m under my parents’ control is a second I have wasted in my life. They have me under their thumb. This may be the only opportunity that I have in a long time to finally get out, but I would most likely be dead broke if I do move. I just want my freedom. I just want balance in my life. I want to be able to go to school and pursue my own interests at the same time. I just want to be normal. I want to go out with friends and be a social person and have a good time. I can’t do any of that in that house, but I also can’t do any of that as a broke college kid. What do I do?

31238,8aqs3j,Pola890,Friendship Boundaries,"Hi Reddit. I was wondering about a friendship situation. I have an online friend for 1,5 a year now. Because of my social awkwardness and years of domestic abuse from my parents, I find it's extremely hard to find a boyfriend, so I never had one, and I'm already 29.5 years old. It's killing me inside and causing great deals of suffering daily. That person was in love with me for a couple of months, but I never wanted to be with him and I told him many times I'm not interested in relationship with him. He said he still wants to be in my life and be my best friend, going through life together. Thing is, when he was in love with me, he said he won't actively help me find a boyfriend, even though he knew how much I suffer because of my loneliness. It was brang up today again, because he said he can do it now, since he's not in love with me anymore. We had a fight, because I think it's selfish that he's ready to help me find it only when it's interfering with some imaginary benefits he was hoping for. I find that friendship, especially wanting to be someone best friend, comes with some expectations and first one is not letting someone suffer on purpose. This is the screenshot of part of the fight, that made me awe in disbelieve. https://i.imgur.com/IHzZzB7.png"
1009,doa3sy,crimson_hunter01,How do you politely tell someone to leave me alone?,"Im in college right now and just got a girlfriend. Theres this dude that also likes my gf and every time im not around he would try to get really close with her. 

He would start drawing doodles on her book with cute message on it. My girlfriend even told him not to sit at my place which is beside her. But he doesnt leave until I arrive. I even told him both of us are dating but he plays dumb acting as if he doesnt get the message. He follows us everywhere whether it be lunch, at the library studying or in class. I guess class is somewhat unavoidable..

Another reason why we don’t like him around is bcuz he fked over with my gf’s friend’s feelings. Btw my circle of friends is my gf, me n hers friend. All of us dont want him around. 

Dont wanna come off as a asshole telling him to get lost but dont want to spend the rest of college with this dude around us... Any advice ?"
31276,8anf69,concernedmobilegamer,I am dealing with a potential pedophile. What do?,"**Brief summary:**
My friend and I are undercover in a Discord server owned by a pedophile who actively hits on children in the server. I have logs of this activity, as well as some of his personal information. Can I, and how do I, report him? 

**Detailed explanation:**
I will be keeping some details, such as names, vague on here just so the man in question cannot possibly find this thread. 

A few days ago, I met a guy in a mobile MMO game. I will refer to this guy as ""Peddy."" We went into a dungeon together, had a good time, and then he invited me to his Discord server. I joined it and very quickly learned that I was getting in over my head. 

Peddy's Discord server has about 120 members, with maybe 20 who are active. They are all his friends or people he invited off of mobile games, like me. Of particular note is that Peddy had a bot, written by himself, on this server. I also met his ""wife"", who I will refer to as ""Bloom."" I held a few conversations and logged off for the night. 

The following day, I skimmed some of the overnight logs and discovered that Bloom was not actually his wife; it was simply a title he used for her. She was not reciprocal or encouraging of the title. I also learned that Bloom was 14 years old. This was a bit concerning, but I initially made the logical conclusion that Peddy was around the same age. It would easily explain his mobile game habits, bad grammar, and his seemingly one sided infatuation with Bloom. Still, a bit concerned, I double checked with him and asked for his age. 

He said he was 20. 

By now, I was getting creeped out. One of the commands his bot possessed was the kiss command -- this command would post a gif of two anime characters intimately kissing accompanied by the message ""[command user] kisses with many love for [command target]"". When he talked about his ""wife"" Bloom, he would often use this command, naming her as the target. She would respond with a simple ""*runs*"" or ""nuuuu"", but nothing more. He would then play it off, saying ""jk"" or talking about how cute Bloom's reaction is. Soon after I discovered the age gap, Bloom actually mentioned it, stating, ""teens cant date adults it's against the law :V"", to which Peddy responded, ""nope. It's fake. USA [allows it]. Canada date with young teen."" 

To add some context to his response, he lives in Quebec. Bloom lives in Texas. Peddy originally came from Cambodia, but moved to Quebec. 

I feel it is important to note that I am also a 20 year old man. This group believes me to be female. This begun as a misunderstanding, but because I had noticed Peddy's creepy behaviour I decided not to correct the misunderstanding. I figured Peddy would underestimate me if I kept up the facade of being an airhead woman, and Bloom would be more willing to confide in me, for similar reasons. I tried to skirt the line between discouraging of Peddy's behaviour whilst not being an antagonistic force. Since he owned the server, he could kick me out of it, so I did not dare to call out his creepiness. Instead, I lightly protested to instances of it when they occurred, so that Bloom at least could see one source of support. (None of the other server regulars points out or batted an eye at the age gap.) 

I quickly contacted Bloom in private to ask her if Peddy's behaviour made her uncomfortable. She was unsure. She was clearly uncomfortable to me, but she couldn't tell herself. I was not too surprised by this, as a 14 year old is hardly the most introspective being out there. In effort to assist her, I let her know that I thought Peddy's behaviour was inappropriate and that I was willing to talk to her about things if she needed an ear. She thanked me and I let her be, as I was still a stranger to her and I did not want to make her uncomfortable. 

I told some friends about the situation around this time. One friend, who I will refer to as MetaMan, wanted to join me. I got Peddy's permission to invite a friend and let in MetaMan, who also posed as a teenage girl for similar reasons that I did. 

MetaMan did some log searches and found another instance of Peddy's creepy behavior from January/February. In these logs, he talked about how much he loved this girl I will call ""Ichigo"", but laments the ""8-10 year"" age gap them. One of his friends responds skeptically, asking if Peddy is a pedophile. Peddy simply denies it and no further discussion occurs. 

I also did some log searching, and found the point when Bloom first joined the server. It was the last week of February. She was much more talkative back then, as well as much more vocal about her discomfort with Peddy. Over the next week, every time she pointed out that he was an adult and she a child, Peddy would come up with an excuse for his behaviour or simply provided examples of couples with the same number of years between them. Notably these couples were adult couples, but being in over her head, Bloom never made that point or commented further on it. 

I have taken screenshots of these incidents, counting more than 50 incriminating screenshots throughout, though I haven't read the entire chat history yet so there are likely even more. 

The final moving part to this is ""Cloudy"", an 11 year old girl who started being active around the time I invited the MetaMan. She, like Bloom, is often the target of Peddy's affections. Unlike Bloom, she is completely reciprocal. She soaks up all of Peddy's attention and returns it. When he asks her if she loves him, she enthusiastically agrees. When he uses his bot's kiss command, she uses it back at him. Just today, he said to her ""I will probably push you in my head and sleep with you"", followed by a crying-laughing emoji to ""lighten"" the statement. She even responded ""do it"", but he then said, ""I won't. too much incest."" Since his english is very poor, I assume he misunderstood adult-child relations to be under the incest umbrella, as his next statement was, ""it's a pervert who do that to a kid. but if it's a kid who want to do that to an adult, it's another story. even having babies."" 

I am detailing these examples so you all understand what type of behaviour I'm dealing with here. If people want, later I can try to post name-censored versions of the actual logs. 

The events I've mentioned here are only bits and pieces. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. 

**What I've pieced together**:
It seems as though Peddy is using this Discord group of his as a sort of ""screening"" to meet young girls, and then, he grooms them in order to make them return his affections. I dont know if his end goal is to sexually take advantage of the children or not, but at the very least, he seems invested in taking advantage of them emotionally. So far, I know of Ichigo, Bloom, and Cloudy, the latter of which is the target of most of his affections as of late. I dont know how many young girls he actually has in this server, as the gender of the ~120 members are fairly evenly split, and the ages seem to range from 10 to 25. To my knowledge, no crimes have been committed yet, but just because I dont know doesn't mean something hasn't happened. 

Some information on Peddy. As I said, he is 20 and lives in Quebec, though he is from Cambodia. He is a narcissistic person. He often brags about his accomplishments, such as the bot he programmed, or his 250 subscribers youtube channel. He almost always will make the conversation about him if it goes on long enough. Additionally he is tactless, talking very openly about his most depressed thoughts and his feelings for these girls. He often talks about Quebec's ""racism"", attributing himself being fired from his first job and a breakup he had to asian racism. He uses his life's woes and his accomplishments as conversational siphons, turning all the attention and everyone's sympathies to him, but will refuse to hear out other's problems. I witnessed Bloom talking about her deceased mother and distant father, and all Peddy responded with was ""rip"" before changing the subject a couple minutes later. 

I have managed to keep a relatively cordial relationship with him. Using this, I have obtained from him his real name, though searching it yielded nothing so I worry that it is fake. 

**Why I've come to /r/advice**:
I have logs. I potentially have his real name. I have his province, though not his city yet. In the interest of protecting these girls, I would like to report him somehow, but I have some issues.

First, *can* I report him? I have no evidence he is actually performing any crimes. My friends have told me just his treatment of these young girls is fishy enough for investigations to occur, but I want to know for sure if that is true.

Second, where can I report him? Is there a website or place I can go to? I live in Canada, but not in Quebec, so should I be looking for something online in Quebec to report to, or is there a general Canadian report process?

Finally, are there any other warnings or advice I can be given on this situation? I feel like there is much more wisdom in numbers than I can possibly think through on my own. Please, if any of you have anything that can help, let me know.

That's all for now. Thanks for reading my long explanation on the situation. "
713,dq8z2j,___idk_,Should I ask her for help?,"So my girlfriend and I have been living in our apartment for a couple months now and I’ve been pretty okay financially up until recently. My old living situation ended and I had to scramble to find a place I could afford and I’m doing so blew through most of my savings on this place. 

I hadn’t been saving for very long so it wasn’t too much for savings and now I’m saving as much as I can from check to check. My girlfriend hasn’t paid a single bill because I told her it was okay and she didn’t have to, she buys groceries and gets us food often because she feels bad that she can’t pay bills so she makes up for it in those ways which I do appreciate. This month pretty much my whole paycheck and what I have left in my savings will go towards all my bills (which fall on the 1st) because my HR shorted me some hours on the previous schedule. 

My issue is that my ex left me because I was going through tough times with money/depression/etc. and even though my current girlfriend would never leave me and is always very open and willing not to mention happy to help me, I just feel terrible for asking because of how I was trained to feel in my past relationship. If I asked her if she’d pay half of rent this month to help me out I know she’d say yes and wouldn’t have a problem with it because she currently only pays for her car and has tons saved up in the bank. What should I do? I know she won’t treat me the way my ex did but after being made to feel awful asking for help for years has me wanting to avoid asking at all costs and just having no money at all until I get paid again."
19568,b0su8a,05Vette,"21 and payed off my Corvette, found a salvage Lotus Elise I can afford, but would make it difficult to go to college at the moment as well. r/PersonalFinance keeps deleting my post","I just turned 21, and payed off my Corvette after two years. I've always loved the Lotus Elise, and almost bought one before my Vette, but bought the Vette since it is a much better car to use as a daily driver. I paid it off early so that I would be able to apply for college this fall with minimal Bill's, but just recently found a rebuilt Lotus Elise at a price I could afford. I'm well aware of the risks of buying a salvage car, and also well aware of how to go about registration and insurance since I worked in the insurance industry. The one for sale is supercharged, has a full exhaust, tune, racing seats and 5 point harness. It wouldn't be a daily driver since I have my Vette, and I have a heated garage with extra space I could park it in, but buying it now would hinder me going to college. At the same time, cars have ALWAYS been my hobby, and this is the cheapest one I have EVER seen listed at $22,900 (with thousands of dollars in upgrades). That's less then I spent on my Vette, and could easily afford it if I held off college.

I'm feeling like this is a heart vs. Brain decision right now. If I held off going to college I could afford it with no problem. But both college and that would be very hard. I'd have to work full time and go to college."

I'm worried it will intrude and change the nature of my friendship with them. Or that anytime I want to go hangout with the guys alone she'll be there.

22971,9fecw4,illP0etic,"I called the cops on someone across the street at work, now my manager is mad at me.","So a little back story, I work at a gas station in North Carolina. As I'm sure some of you are aware, Hurricane Florence is about to hit the Eastern coast. So people have been going a little overboard and buying gas/water/milk/bread/ect.  
Yesterday, we were absolutely slammed after just receiving a shipment of gas, beforehand we were out the ENTIRE day. Directly across the street is a small trailer park and some of the people who live there often frequent my store for beer/cigarettes and such. Around 7pm I had two customers come up to me at my register and tell me they were stopped by a couple of men in the road before turning into my store and were offered gasoline and gas cans for $9/gallon. This is SUPER illegal and can cost you up to $25k in fines where I live. After the second customer told me about it and how sketchy it was, I made an anonymous tip to my local sheriff's department. 

Long story short, nothing happened in terms of arrests, however, the sheriff's told the men that someone from the ""store across the street"" had called in to report them selling gas illegally (they were, just didn't get caught).
I told my co-workers I called, they told me to mind my business and to forget about it 

Now today, my manager calls me into the office and is fuming that I had called and that I cost the store 2 long time customers. No one told them it was me, but they somehow seemed to figure it out. She was on the verge of firing me over it. 
""While you're here, you do your job, and your job isn't to police the neighborhood, it's to help customers"" is what I was told. 

The two men who I called the cops on are ex military drunkards who would constantly come in with dogs(no pets allowed) and swearing in front customers particularly little children with their parents. I have no remorse for what I did but I don't want to lose my job over it.

What should I do/have done?

24704,96np4f,WiseRegret,Girl possibly faking pregnancy,"Hi everyone, I created a throwaway account for this, but I could use a bit of perspective.

I had anal sex with a friend with benefits on the 30th of June this year, and received oral sex from her on the 7th of July. On the 29th of July she contacted me saying she thought she was pregnant, and I asked if she had a blood test, which is where it gets weird.  
She said yes, she had had a blood test and the result was that she was not pregnant. I thought it may have been possible that my penis was inserted into her vagina on the 30th of June by accident, so it may be plausible.  


Starting to think something is a bit off with her mentally, I said that I would take her to the same doctor on the 30th of July to confirm (I basically just wanted to see this negative result with my own eyes.)   


The doctor said she was given a quantitative blood test a few days prior, and the results were negative. He assured me that there was no possible way she could be pregnant as she would have a higher HCG count than she had (I don't remember the exact number.)

Directly after the doctors appt, she still insisted on being pregnant, so I dropped her home and ceased contact with her, as I was beginning to think she had mental issues.  


Fast forward to Wednesday the 8th of August, where I look at her Instagram and Facebook, where she is posting photos of her ""baby bump"", which I can't tell if it is her pushing her stomach out, telling her friends she is at 8 weeks pregnancy and having having twins, and that her due date is March 23rd 2019. I'm able to provide links to pictures in DMs if anyone can help me confirm whether this is just a girl pushing her stomach out, or a baby bump at 8 weeks due to twins.

I immediately make an appointment with the doctor she got the blood test with to see if anything had changed since the last time we spoke. The doctor obviously was careful not to give any information away about a patient while she was not there, all she said was ""that the situation had not progressed since the last time we spoke."" She also indicated she had not seen the girl since the time I took her there.  
I really don't know what to believe, a google search for ""False negative HCG test"" indicates that sometimes the test can be wrong, which according to my doctor is such a small probability if the test was done that far into a ""pregnancy"". I don't want to contact her, as she's been seeming as if she's obsessive with me in the past, however I had no idea that her mental state was this bad if she's making the whole thing up. However, it's really been staying on my mind, and if anyone can offer some advice that'd be great.

Thanks in advance

3532,db5gzn,mylifeisinshambles5,My parents found out about my belly button piercing and they are REALLY mad. How can I earn their trust back?,"I’m F20 and today I went out and got my belly button pierced and lied about where I was. I’m a really bad liar so when I came home they knew something was up because I was acting jittery and nervous. So I came clean and told them what I had done and my mom reacted way worse than I thought. A little background my parents are very traditional and conservative and HATE piercings. And to make things even worse, they trust me a lot before this and always told me how they’re so proud I’m such a good kid and don’t go behind their backs and they thought I was super innocent and a good kid. So imagine their shock when I told this about this. My mom told me she has now completely lost all trust in me and that she’s never been so disappointed with me in her life. She said that I can forget about ever going out again besides to go to school and that I can forget about going out with friends for my 21st birthday (which is in November). She got so mad and I apologized profusely but she just said “I can’t even look at you or talk to you right now. You’ve ruined my day. Don’t talk to me for the rest of the night” and then stormed off to her room. I haven’t seen her this mad in a long time. I know what I did was wrong, but I can’t take it back now. I feel like they are never gonna look at me the same and now they think I’m a bad person. How can I earn their trust back? I’m sitting here crying because I feel like I’ve just ruined my relationship with them."
23274,9dtuzi,assnavocado,"My husband insisted on naming our son something ridiculous, 2 years later he still calls him that name","I could really use some advice on this. I'm at a loss. 

Background: My husband goes by nickname he was given about 15 years ago by some guys he would hang out with (party buddies) in his early 20s: Columbia. He's Colombian. When we met he introduced himself as this. Everyone he introduced me to called him this. 

When we got to know each other I found out his name is Antonio.  He insisted that Columbia is his middle name and that he hasn't used the name Antonio in over 30 years. I found this to be untrue, his family calls him Tony (as do many older friends) and his birth certificate doesn't have that on it. Regardless. I respect his wishes for what he wants to be called despite the fact that I really like his ""first name"". He insists everyone call him that name. 

Before I got pregnant my husband and I would lay around and talk about baby names. Some were silly, but it was fun. He said if he ever had a boy he wanted to name him Columbia. Our second is a boy. 

Right when we found out the gender, he stuck with the Columbia thing. I said no. That caused a fight. He thought it was selfish that I knew it was important to him and I say no. For months, we danced around the conversation. Anytime I would bring it up he had some excuse for postponing it. I compromised by saying Columbia could be the middle name. We never really had the names nailed down but basically we agreed on Antonio Columbia ""Jr."" 

As soon as I went into labor and was admitted to the hospital he was announcing the name Columbia to anyone that asked. He had it written on the birth board and crib card. It was infuriating. I was in labor and didn't want to deal with this. I followed up whatever he said with, ""we haven't decided yet."" When he came out my husband kept demanding that name. I kept saying no so he left. He went home and dismissed his parents from watching our 6 year old. I was really heartbroken and torn. When he came to pick us up the birth certificate was blank. We sat there bickering back and forth and finally I said here, have your way name him Columbia! My husband must have felt bad and we ended up naming him Antonio Columbia. 

The first night home I put a picture on Facebook with the name ""Tony."" My husband flipped out and said he's not going to be called Tony. He hated being called that and wanted it removed and for me to tell my family not to call him Tony. So I call him Ant or Antonio. My family as well as his calls him Antonio. Sometimes he would say something but usually he yells the name Columbia while talking to our son so everyone can hear. Whenever people ask the name he would answer first and say Columbia. It wore me down. I stopped chiming in.  I usually call my son baby boy or Buddy. I hate fighting over it. 

2 years later, my husband got more stubborn and gets angry when people call him Antonio. He will say it's not his name, he's not going to use it, why can't people respect his wishes, and so on. He does NOT care how I feel about it. He doesn't care how our families feel. He says he is going to insist that our son's teachers call him Columbia. I'm dreading the day I enroll my son in school or meet with any teacher.

My husband is my best friend, I love him. This is causing a lot of resentment and issues. I probably could have done a better job at asserting myself but this is where I am. I have tried many times to get him to see my point of view and gain some empathy as a parent. Nothing. If I call him Antonio, we fight. If anyone calls him Antonio he bitches to me about it relentlessly. Do I divorce him for this? Am I being irrational at all? He's open to counseling but we have different schedules and going through a tight financial situation so we need to hold off for now. 

Tldr; my husband wanted to name our son (in my eyes) a ridiculous name. He refused to budge and although it is my son's middle name he insists everyone call him that. Anything else causes fights and anger fits. He doesn't care about my opinion. Other than this he is my best friend. Where do we go from here? 

I'm going to add that he has always been a stubborn person. There are certain things he's set on and will fight me on. But for big things and decisions we can usually find a compromise. Except this. I have sat him down on multiple occasions and tried to talk about it but he will not budge. When I was pregnant he insisted on the name and was stubborn but we seemed to agree on Antonio. When people asked he would say Antonio Columbia. The minute I was admitted he started with this. I was really upset that he got so angry over ""Tony."" According to him, he hates the name Tony but likes the name Antonio. He just doesn't use it and neither will our son. "
20940,au3idr,getasnorlax669,Please help. My sisters husband cheated on her and wants her and their baby out of the house and he is refusing to help pay for anything.,"We live in Indiana.  He abandoned their house for weeks, apparently staying with his mom for ray timeframe...was always gone for “work trips.”  He cheated (I don’t know the details or for how long) and decided he wants to divorce her immediately.  When she became pregnant with their baby, he insisted she didn’t work and raised the baby herself.  My sister was scared of a divorce because of certain things happening and started searching for a job, which was next to impossible because she hadn’t worked in so long.  She finally got accepted for one that pays below a living wage...she won’t be able to afford an apartment.  He made it clear he doesn’t want full custody of their baby.   I went over her expenses with her and she would need to make more than twice the amount of money she will be making at this job to BARELY afford a living wage.   What can she do?  Living at a Section 8 property is definitely not going to happen.  If she moves back in with our mom, there is no job opportunity there and she will not be able to save money.   She is feeling very emotionally unstable at the moment.  I absolutely don’t know what I can do for her.  I’ve been talking to her often and keeping her calm.  He said if she refuses to move out of (their) house, he will stop paying the bills...which are all in her name.  He wants to keep the house on his own...even though he won’t be having their baby.  He said he would pay her CAR bill if she moved in with our mom.  That’s it.  They were together for fifteen years and none of us saw this coming.

But ever since I fucked up and confessed too early that I liked her, everything went downhill.

We started to talk to each other less often and my self confidence took a large hit. My personality changed from being talkative and sociable to introverted and quiet. Even after graduating high school, I still do remember vividly about what she said, and I just can't stop thinking about her. 

I just wished that I could turn back time and be the best friend she wanted. So, I feel that i have grown person wise, and I would like to reconnect with her again.

4118,d8593x,louisana-94,Having a hard time getting over breakup. Feel like I’ll never find a connection like that again,"Loved this girl more than anything I just pushed her away. Being an asshole to her sometimes, criticizing her for small insignificant shit, and being controlling due to anxiety and worry about the future/money drove her away. I regret it terribly, but I learned a lot. I’m also in therapy working on anxiety and controlling emotions. I just didn’t know how to act and how to treat her. It was my first serious relationship and we moved in together quickly after and were so wrapped into each other it felt like we weren’t our own person. She was perfect throughout the relationship.

We were together 3 years and have been together since we were 20. I’m scared I’ll never find a bond like that again. I really don’t mean to be self absorbed but I’m at least a relatively good looking guy and should attract other girls but I’m just really scared I’ll never enjoy being around someone as much.  I’ve been with a couple girls since the breakup trying to get over it but it just makes me sad it’s not her. 

She wants nothing to do with me at the moment but she said she’d be open to trying again in the future. 

Are these normal thoughts to have? Will they go away?

Also isolated myself from most of my friends during our relationship so I only go out once or twice a week. It’s hard just sitting at home sometimes. I just don’t get how she can be completely over it when we cared so much about each other and were with each other everyday 😩"

When i get there we aren’t really friends or smth but my dumbass liking her had something else in mind, so i start casually flirting which let s say im a 5-6/10 at and it s seemingly working. I’m a much better at a full fletched conversation. Eventually i get there and i “interview” her as a game, immitating david letterman of sorts, and ask her some really great questions about herself and she gets really excited when she s talking about it, she liked this, we then later smoked some weed in her room then just sat in bed close to each other listening to frank ocean and stuff like that which i also showed her and really liked it. Then at the fest we were dancing but then pur friends got hungry, and left us alone. Something that never happened before. She focused on me rather than the festival, she danced with and it was great. But the thing and the issue is, she gives me all these signs and when our group of friends arrive it s not there anymore(need to mention she had no previous relationship with the 2 boys that were with me and the other 6 girls or smth) i talked to a real good friend of mine about it and she said do something while her friends are there, so i did, she turned around  and i grabbed her hands and danced with her, and she had a genuine smile, then she goes over to her friend and starts dancing, like that didn’t happen. (Also the body language was there, we stared at each other smiling and shit) i really don’t know, it feels like i had something slowly building up but now the festival s over and it s weird for me to hit her up, since last time when i sent her a meme on ig and she left it on seen(we were both on the train but she didn t react to it)

My husband, on the other hand, has a tendency to get so immersed in them that he will play through the night and sleep all day, essentially messing up his sleep schedule. This also impacts our weekends because he sleeps in and all the activities we agree to do (i.e. hiking, shopping, going to the aquarium, etc.) Require us to be there early in the morning.

His latest addiction is Fortnite. He also streams, and I know it's something he's always wanted to do. But it becomes a problem when it runs our weekends and I don't really get to hang out with him one-on-one because he is antsy about getting back to the game.

I've tried talking to him about it, but he'll spend time with me as for a few hours then go right back to it. I just want an entire day of no video games and to get out of our apartment.

876,dp4ro3,throwaway301019,Should I tell my mother I'm suicidal?,"TW; Mental abuse  


**TL;DR:** Should I tell my mother I want to end my life because we live with my abusive father unless we move away?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 27 year old living in Europe. I live in a very dysfunctional family, nothing new under the sun, everybody has had their troubles. The problem is this has been going on for all my life. The root of the problem is my father.   
Ten years ago I broke contact with him because of how he treated me. He never understood why and he still can't wrap his head around it. My big sister and little brother still have contact with him - shaky but contact nonetheless. He belittles us, never remembers our birthdays, don't know our age, bullies us, tells us how bad we are, don't believe in us etc.  It took years for my sister to respect my decision but now she understands because she knows how messed up our father is. My little brother is estranged from me thanks to our father thanks to all the hate he spews in his ear about me.  


Now to the problem: We all live in the same house. My sister moved some years ago, but my brother still lives here and lives off of our father, for example he doesn't work and don't have to pay his own bills. Our father does that for him. My mother lives here, she's my safe port. And our father lives here. He lives on the lot but in his own quarters he built decades ago. So not part of the house. Thankfully.   
We never have people over because of the tension in our family. In our home town everybody loves our father and thinks he's the best so they think we have a lovely life here inside our walls. If you ever tell someone who knows our father beforehand how abusive he is they will not believe you because he's such a good sport to everyone else - except us.

  
I avoid him every day because he's caused me so much trauma. If he's inside the house and I've been out walking my dog I wait outside in the garden until he leaves so I don't have to face him. When he comes into the house I leave and lock myself in my room. Whenever he's present I exclude myself automatically. It's unbearable but more bearable than actually having to face him.  


Which I did a couple of days ago. He was screaming at my mother and being nasty so I stepped between them. I told him to leave the room because he was being so awful. He proceeded to threaten me and told me very sarcastically 'good luck in life'. My brother heard all this and said that I should watch my mouth. My brother has threatened me with violence before.   
The other day our father spoke to my sister and blew up in her face, calling her an alcoholic bitch and that he never wants to hear from her again. (because she's sided with me. He sees it as sides in a game of sports)  
Needless to say this broke me because there's something incredibly heartbreaking about being hated by your own family just because you want to protect yourself + your mother. It's an odd feeling and it hurts me.   


I have struggled with a deep depression for years and suicidal thoughts. I have nightmares about my father and my little brother hurting me and my mother. Mostly me. The problem is that for my mother it's just her unruly son and her ex husband. They are tied together in the mortgage for the house and unless she coughs up half a million to pay her side of the loan she can never leave or move. She's tied down.   
Me? I have no education thanks to my decade long fight with depression and anxiety. I have no income at all. I am aiming at finishing my college degree next year if my mental health is ok.   


**Which leads me to my question;** because I am so fundamentally scared and tired of life I have no will of living if it's in this house among people that hate me for just existing - I want to end my life. My mother can stand life here, she just says ""If we have each other it will be all right"". Which is true but for how long? 

I am faced every day with torment and hate. I am not wanted here. It is so difficult. I have no future. I see myself dying in this house. Is it wrong to tell my mother that I will die here if we never leave? Is that wrong to say or should I be honest? I know her hands are somewhat tied because she works minimum wage and she's nearing 60. We have no idea what to do. Neither my father or brother pays any rent or help with the electrical bill. I'm asking for help from some outside eyes peeking in at this mess. What am I to do?"
20097,ay1bsi,vinnbet,paying for the ex-wife of husband's funeral?,"I need some advice as to if I am being unreasonable. My husband has 2 kids with his ex, ages 14 and 18. They are great kids and have been my stepchildren for 4 years. Their mom had a substance abuse problem that took her life accidentally. She didn't have anything in her will other than some sentimental items for the children.

The exes family has no money to put towards the funeral, but they feel she deserves a good send-off. They have been contacting my husband to ask him to contribute. They feel $5-7 thousand is reasonable as she gave him 2 beautiful kids. They have just been sending bills to our house and telling him he needs to pay it. The thing is, we  have about that much saved up.

If I am being honest, I don't want to spend any of our savings on this funeral. I don't like the anxiety I get when I think of the insecurity it will cause. I am the main financial contributor and I handle the bills. It took us over a year to save $5000 and the kids are talking about colleges. My husband is helping with the kids grieving and says it is my decision if we take this on.

I am wondering if I am being heartless. I might be jaded because this woman hated me. She felt her and my husband would have eventually gotten back together if I hadn't existed. She definitely wouldn't have contributed to my funeral even though her kids can me ""mom"" too. 

What do I do? HELP please."

Regardless, how have you just moved on? Talk about “letting it go” doesn’t make sense to me. HOW Ado I let it go? I have been thinking about it all morning, even though I don’t want to."
13379,bwnyfo,spongebopbop,Random girls are making me uncomfortable by approaching my boyfriend while they know we are together.,"We are at uni, me and my boyfriend are together since few months. Few days ago I was sitting with him in the library and two girls (one of them is a friend of his best friend) came and the other one (not his friend) started saying “Oh myboyfriendsname I’m your biggest fan!” and both of those girls started laughing trying to get his attention. My boyfriend just said “okay” and got back to reading his notes. I was there all the time, staring at them. When finally they’ve noticed me they run away laughing. My boyfriend said that this one girl that said that tried to follow him on instagram but he deleted her request. After the situation those girls called my boyfriend’s best friend and told them that they were talking with him and they didnt notice I was there. How should I feel about it?

It happens a lot both of instagram or in real life - my partner ignores it every time, or blocks but I don’t know if I should react somehow to that? Should I call them out?

35291,7x2y8s,_The_Walking_Man_,"My best friend, who I’ve had a complicated relationship with, won’t talk to me anymore because her boyfriend doesn’t like us talking.","I already posted this to r/offmychest but didn’t get any response, so I thought I’d post here as well:

Alright, the title is definitely over-simplifying it, so I’ll just tell the whole story, I apologize for the word wall. I’m probably giving wayyyyy more detail than necessary, but I feel like everything needs to be said so you’ll understand the situation. I’ll try to make a TL;DR once I’m finished. I only have one friend left to talk to at this point and I’ve already talked to him about this more than I think he’s cared to listen to, and he’s too close to me and the girl, who I’ll call A, to really give me unbiased advice, so I’ve come here. 

So I might as well start at the beginning. I met A at the beginning of 11th grade (last year), and we hit it off really well, like, really really well. I’ve never met someone who I connected with more naturally in my whole life. After talking to her once I knew I wanted to be friends with her, and soon after realized I hoped for more. We texted day and night for a week and a half/two weeks every free moment we had. We’d be up until 1 or 2 in the morning talking and it was great. But after this, we decided to hang out together with my friend and his girlfriend. She seemed really excited and I was really happy that we were gonna get to hang out outside of school for once, but she never showed up. After about 20 minutes of waiting, she finally texted me and told me she had a migraine and couldn’t make it. I had my suspicions that it was just an excuse but I wasn’t sure. That night, I told her how I felt and asked her how she felt about me, and she told me she liked me but didn’t have time in her life for a relationship. She said there was too much chaos in her life. This was a real bummer but I thought maybe it was more of a “no for now” than a definite no. Then, a few weeks later, she started dating another guy, who we’ll call S. After this we still remained friends, and I eventually put my feelings behind me (sort of). 

Last semester (12th grade), we had a class together and we would always joke around and have fun. There kind of seemed like there was something between us, but I pushed those thoughts out of my mind since she was dating S. Nothing too eventful. 

Now, here’s where things started happening. With the semester over, I wasn’t going to attend high school anymore, so I wouldn’t get to see her anymore, and I had a week off before I started college. We ended up deciding to go see a movie with my buddy (B) and his friend (K), who is now his girlfriend. B drove us all there, and me and A sat in the back. During the ride, we were joking around a lot and having fun, and we kept inadvertently touching each other on the hand or leg then quickly pulling back. At one point, B saw an abandoned barn and we stopped to check it out, which A was very opposed to. But we went on nonetheless, and once we got in, A started acting scared and clutched my arm and put her head against me. Then she dragged me back out and to the car, still holding me. It seemed weird but I wasn’t sure what to make of it. 

After this, we finally got to the theater. During the movie, we leaned very close to one another and whispered back and forth a lot, still joking around. (Don’t worry, there wasn’t anyone around us and we were quiet. We’re not those annoying people at the theater.) And I noticed her texting her boyfriend during the movie. At this point, I realized this upset me, but tried to tell myself not to get upset. I was still trying to convince myself I didn’t have feelings for her. Anyway, after the movie finished, we headed back, and it was much the same as the way there. There was one thing that happened that was very awkward though: she had leaned in to say something to B up front, and I leaned in to whisper something in her ear as a joke, but she turned toward me at the same time, so we were a couple inches from each other’s face. We just looked at each other for a few seconds then pulled back. I tried to explain it wasn’t what it looked like, but she didn’t seem bothered, so we just moved on. After we got to B’s house, me and A stood outside talking for quite a while, and I told her to text me whenever she wanted to. 

As soon as I got home, she texted me and we proceeded to text until 3 in the morning. She asked if I was trying to kiss her in the car, and I told her I wasn’t. Then she basically seemed to be suggesting that if I had, she probably would have gone with it, but didn’t want to say it outright. She told me she still had feelings for me sometimes and that was why she had been so distant for a long time. She also told me her boyfriend was very angry about her hanging out with me even though he told her it was okay. 

For the next few days, we texted and called nearly nonstop from the time we got up until 3 or 4 in the morning. On Thursday, we started to discuss some very serious issues. She had been sexually assaulted by a female friend a few years back, even though she hadn’t ever thought of it that way. (She got her drunk and left hickies up and down her whole body while she was passed out and the friend was 18 while she was 15). While we were talking, A came to the realization that this had caused her to be very bothered by sexual contact. Then she told me how her boyfriend didn’t care when she told him she didn’t want to do anything, but he made her have sex with him anyway and would get very angry at her when she was on her period and make her do other things instead (which she hated doing and told him so). All of this was very hard for me to hear because I care about A so much and I can’t imagine anyone treating such a sweet person like that, much less two. She told me she would talk to S (presumably to break up) and also told me how thankful she was that I listened to everything she had to say and how important our friendship was to her. 

Before I talk about Friday, I should mention that she was subtly trying to hint that I should talk to her friend, E, because she thought we’d be good together. I found this weird because I knew she had feelings for me and she had to know I did too. I think she was trying to push me off onto her because she felt like she’d just hurt me. Anyway, we had decided to watch a movie together Friday night because she loves Moana and I hadn’t seen it. A was going to E’s house that night, so we planned to watch the movie sometime after I got off work, but E wanted to invite me to eat dinner with them. Somehow I let A talk me into this, which led to a very awkward couple hours. When we finally finished up and I got home, A slipped away from E’s house and came over. While we watched the movie, A kept leaning in toward me and eventually leaned against my shoulder. I wasn’t sure what to do at first but I eventually put my arm around her and we started cuddling. We sat like this silently for a long time. Once the movie finished, she jumped up very quickly, and I assumed it was because she realized what time it must be. She left and later that night, we talked again. She told me that she wasn’t leaning in to cuddle, she was just exhausted and falling asleep because she had stayed up so late the night before. I felt awful when I heard that because I realized how uncomfortable I must have made her. Then she tried to convince me I should give E a chance so I told A how I felt. I told her she the only girl I wanted to be with, and if I couldn’t be with her I wasn’t really interested in anything else right now, certainly not someone she’s friends with. I told her I knew it wasn’t the right time but until it was, I wasn’t ready for something else. 

The next day, she was at S’s house for a few hours, which I thought seemed strange since I assumed she was breaking up with him. It shouldn’t take that long. That night, she didn’t seem to want to talk about it, so I left it alone. She convinced me to watch a romantic movie and tell her what I thought of it. We talked about that and she was flirting with me a little. Then on Sunday, I decided to ask her what happened with S. She said she talked to him about all the stuff she told me and that he felt really bad and told her he would do whatever he could to help her work through it. She said she understood if I didn’t want to talk to her anymore, and I told her I needed some time to think things through, so I waited until Tuesday to talk to her again. That week, we texted some, but not nearly as much as the week before. On Saturday, me and B went out to eat and coincidentally ended up at the same restaurant A and S were at. A told me S was very angry that I was there. 

The next day I told her how I thought she needed to break up with S. I made it very clear I wasn’t saying these things to get him out of the way, I said it because I was concerned for her. I reminded her how she told me he would get angry at her over everything and would get jealous anytime she hung out with anyone other than him. And, most importantly, the issue with him not taking “no” for an answer. She then told me that it wasn’t like that, she said she pretended to enjoy it and he had no idea she wasn’t into it. Which was totally contrary to what she had told me before. I tend to believe what she told me originally more. Her response this day seemed very prepared and not genuine, whereas she seemed very honest and emotional before. She said she “owed him a chance to change” which I think is a stupid reason, and told her so. But, to be fair, he’s given up weed (which he was pretty much addicted to) and is going out and doing more stuff with her now. I’m just afraid he’s just doing it temporarily to keep her. I hope I’m wrong but I can easily see him going right back to the way he was. 

She didn’t text me at all that following week. This week (the next week), I decided to text her about it and she told me we couldn’t talk in private text messages anymore because S doesn’t like it. She said we could only talk in a group chat we have with E and B. I also found out from E that A has been very distant with her lately as well. 

Now I don’t know what the hell to do. I care about A so much but I don’t know what I can do for her. I want us to still be friends because I can’t bear not having her as a friend. She was one of my best friends. She was the only one I have other than B. I don’t want to see her get hurt again, but I feel like S will. I want her to be happy, and if being with S makes her happy, I don’t want to ruin it, but I don’t know how we can be friends if he’s so opposed to me being in her life. I’ve tried to think about what I should do. I’ve thought about telling her I want to still be friends and see if she’s willing to do it even though it makes him mad. I’ve thought about just leaving her alone and hoping she comes back on her own, but I doubt that will actually happen because she’s going to basic training in June. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to date her right now, I just want to be friends and make sure S treats her right. 

As a side note, she borrowed a couple books from me and I want them back at some point. I hate to ask for them now because she hasn’t finished them yet, but I’m afraid if I wait for a couple months until she is, it’s gonna be really awkward asking for them back. 

TL; DR
Girl who I had mutual feelings for dated another guy instead of me. Recently she admitted she still has feelings for me, and told me about the way her boyfriend has been treating her. Now he’s angry about us talking and won’t let her talk to me. 

I know this reads like a teen drama, but I just need someone to talk to about what I should do. "
31339,8aho6o,pizzamargerita,How do you not get annoyed at a friend who is dumb?,"I have a friend who is really a nice person but the things she say are just really, really dumb. At first, I thought she might have high-functioning autism but now, I think she just lives in her own world (I'm not saying all people with autism are dumb; it's just that she wouldn't get the social cues). The comments she make are so dumb and she would talk about unrelated stuff to the topic (because she misunderstood the topic). For example, she would say stuff like ""your eye color looks different in this photo"" when I was clearly wearing colored lenses. 

I have a YouTube channel and she's mentioned that I should stop laughing/grinning in my videos because it shows lack of confidence. She's said this several times and I already told her it's not welcome and it's stupid to expect YouTube to be like TV. She would say stuff are just really annoying and she just doesn't understand why saying such a thing is bad. 
How do I accept that she just thinks things in a unique manner and not to get annoyed at her comments however stupid they are?"
4238,d7kp1b,oxras,Feels like I haven't lived up to my potential and now it's too late,"Hello everyone,

The title pretty much explains what I'm going through. I hope this doesn't come across as tooting my own horn, because that's really not my intent. Basically, ever since I was younger (and sometimes still) people always bigged me up about how I am one of the smarter people they know and I'll do great and all that.

About that, I personally never felt that way, I believe everything could be achieved with sufficient amount of effort, and I simply think the reason my peers think of me this way is because I'm extremely competitive and if I can't solve something, I could go at it for an entire day until I figure it out.

All things considered, this made me believe that life would be somewhat easy (financially speaking) and I would find a way to generate a decent income as soon as I started focusing my efforts on it. (this thought was between me graduating highschool and me graduating university pretty much)

Now I'm 26, been working an office job for the past two years, and very unhappy about how things turned out. It feels like the years passed me by while I did absolutely nothing.

At the same time, after spending a year in the industry, I don't feel like I could've changed much through my own efforts either. I got some extra work that I'm absolutely not qualified for just because of connections, and had to pretty much figure it out on the spot (the jobs went well since I feel comfortable with this sort of thing like I explained earlier, but there's no way I would've got these jobs without the connections.) I work as a developer for a decent amount of money in my country, but since I live in a 3rd world country, it's basically peanuts anywhere else.

For the past few months, I've been trying so hard to be able to compete with the salaries of better countries by taking almost every side job possible. I don't mind working the long hours, but as you all know, these types of things aren't stable, which leaves me with an income that I'm not comfortable with. I even resorted to gambling since I had absolutely nothing else to do with my time and I wanted to make money desperately (didn't end well - lost around a month of pay after series of very unlucky streaks)

I feel like I failed and I have absolutely no idea how to turn it around. I'm living a decent lifestyle, I can buy most of the things I want and save some money almost every month, but it just doesn't feel good enough (mostly because of how low my income is in the global economy).

Leaving the country sounds like the most viable idea, but I also feel like it's too big of a risk and there's no guarantee that I'll be living a better lifestyle elsewhere at this point (too late?).

There's so much more I would've liked to talk about and give details, but I didn't want to extend the the post for too long. My DM's are open to anyone who'd like have a chat with me.

I appreciate every bit of advice you could give me."

21684,9k0a2e,kierkegaard1128,Girlfriend is cheating on me with best friend who is also my roommate.,"This is actually my first ever post on reddit and I'm VERY new to reddit so I'm unaware of how this all works. Here is my Story:

It is hard to say that ALL of the blame falls on my girlfriend or my best friend at this point, and I admit I am not the perfect boyfriend or anything. My Girlfriend has been my best friend and my next door neighbor since we were literally babies. We have always been friends but would be ""on again/off again"" type of friends. But we were always very close when we were friends. In the summer of 2015, we actually decided we were in love and we began dating. At the time, we both decided to that our relationship would be polyamorous. We decided this because we had both just gotten out of long monogamous relationships and just wanted to be free. We did make one specific rule though: At the end of the day, we would ALWAYS come home to each other. Fast forward 2 years later, and through an acquaintance of my brother, we met a couple who I will call ""Candy"" and ""Eric"". Basically me and my girlfriend be-friended these two and we became close to Eric. We even included him in our polyamorous relationship (had threesomes and my girlfriend slept with him), which I was cool with at that time. But soon after he became part of our relationship, Eric and Candy broke up in a really bad way. Candy even left the country and left Eric with HER dogs to take care of and the apartment and all the bills. Soon, my girlfriend would begin to lie to me and spend the night over at his place and say she was with friends or family. I caught her one time by accident when she said she was at her parent's at the same time that I was at my parents house (because our parents are still next door neighbors. I then proceeded to go to his house because I had a feeling and her car was there. After I confronted her she justified it by saying he needed company since Candy left. Even though she broke the one rule that no matter what, I allowed it because all the while Eric and I WERE really good friends. We played video games together, smoked weed, went out to bars and just chilled. Then after Eric's lease was up, he moved in with us because he could not support Bill's on his own, was emotionally unstable from the bad break up, etc. And I thought I was doing the right thing. Since he moved in, me and my girlfriend started having sex less and less often and she was never as intimate with me. I soon learned via accidentally walking in on her and my roommate doing sexual things that she was cheating on me. After that I explained to both of them that I didn't want them to see each other because my girlfriend stopped having sex with me when he was around and they would both lie to me so I was just uncomfortable with the whole idea. But now, they have both cheated on me many times since then. At least a half a dozen and the issue is that we NEED him to pay rent in order to survive. He also helped me get a job with him and he's kind of my boss so that's difficult too. Now I tell my girlfriend I want to kick him out but she's mad at me and saying that I am basically blowing all of this our of proportion. I am scared and this whole debacle has sent me into a deep state if depression and anxiety. Please help me."
15819,bkyijg,GavRhino,How to get over an embarassing moment that has happened multiple times.,"It's happened several times, and it's really annoying and embarassing when it does. At school, occasionally my head blocks people's view of the whiteboard etc, so they ask me to move it. The issue is- I never know which way to move it, so end up looking like a complete idiot.

For example, once this kid told me to move my head so he could see the board, however instead of ducking my head (which it became clear later was what I wanted me to do), I very stupidly tilted my head to the side, as I didn't understand what he was asking me to do.

On another occasion, someone wanted me to move my head to the left, however they didn't specify this, so I ended up making a complete prick of myself and moving it to the right, which many people laughed at.

Now, this has happened a couple of times since, and many people make fun of me whenever it happens.

This is probably a very stupid question, but how can I make sure that a) I know which way to move my head if people ask me?, and b) to forget about all the times this 'incident' has occurred?"

38142,7nkvbx,imnotfunnyhelp,How do I stop being so possessive/jealous over nothing?,"Hi

I am a kid who has a girlfriend who is a bit of a tomboy, so it's expected that she has a lot of guy friends. Her guy friends are people she met before me. Honestly, I'm fine with this. As long as they're on friendly terms, it won't bother me. But she has this one guy friend(they're on friendly terms, but they used to be a thing for a short while) who I just can't ""trust""(?). I mean, I know we could be good friends, but it feels like he's not very fond of me.

I know I'm just overreacting because of my low self-esteem, but I just feel off when he's around. 

Also, she mentioned that he asked her a question before that seemed kinda off. ""Our group of friends or us?""
She asked him what he would pick, and guess what? He chose the latter.

She just went with the flow and answered the same. I mean, would you ask a friend that you're not into that question? I know I wouldn't. Btw I get that people are different, but he's a regular guy, it's not like he has no social skills. So he understood what he said when he told her that. When she tried to ask him who he liked, he said that he wasn't interested in anyone atm. Pretty sus.

Anywho, because of that, I guess I unconsciously became more possessive and easily jealous. So whenever she talks to a guy and it seems like they're having fun, I just get jealous. 

I really want to fix this problem of mine. It's causing even more problems. Help me.

36082,7u6s1h,mistyboth,Lost in life... need help finding the best path if there is one,"Throwaway acct to hide from SO.

I am so sad with where I am in my life. I'm recovering from a week of spiraling depression and suicidal thoughts. Maybe I need a therapist but I don't think I can afford one. I don't want to be stagnant in life forever.. working shitty, stressful jobs after shitty, stressful jobs JUST to survive. I'd be happy to abandon my college ""career"" to take a job to make actual money. I hate stressing about making enough money just to make rent. I want to be at peace in my house and not have to deal with drama. I want to have a healthy relationship. I want to retire before 98 yrs old! 

I'm not sure how all my choices ended up leading me where I am... but I need guidance.

**My SO**: 

The good: He's a sweet guy, genuinely nice person, thinks of his friends and others before himself for the most part. He's fun, nerdy, cute/adorable. He does occasionally take me out (like twice a year....).

The bad: He's lazy, doesn't contribute to household tasks or important paperwork (taxes/insurance) without having to be asked/reminded 1-50 times, and just a general manchild. We've never been in sync with money or saving for goals. It barely feels like a relationship. He doesn't offer to help me financially (like my car repairs, even though he albeit rarely uses the car), and when he does, he seems to be regretting it the moment he asks. On top of me having to be a mommy, I also never feel like #1 in his life. He JUMPS at the chance to hang out with friends and talk about or play games, but whenever I ask if he'd like to go out with me - ""It depends"". 

He's not a terrible person AT ALL. There have been moments and memories we've shared that prove to me that he does love me through and through. If he would just grow the fuck up, it would be so much easier to live with him. Sometimes I wonder if being with him is holding me back from going forward with my life.

**Financial**: 

Aside from SO, I live with another couple near Seattle, WA and we share a ~$2000 2-bedroom in a safe area. These are my monthly financials:

* Food: $150-200
* Rent(and various utilities): $500-530
* Car Insurance: $60 (couldn't find it cheaper)
* Car Savings (for annual repairs): $100
* Cell phone: $22
* Shopping (for non-foods, work related stuff, or other things to just enjoy): $50-100
* Gas: $50
* Student Loan: $0(currently because lender put it on forbearance during investigation of school. Normally $20-50 IBR, or $500/mo standard)

I want to be able to live on my own, but I can't afford it (also still working out the emotions with the SO). I want to go back to school for computer science because I want a salary I can actually do more than survive on. More debt sounds very stupid, and working FT/PT and paying off school+rent sound impossible!

I can only think of a few options:

***Option #1***: Save up with my current shitty (stressful) job, till I can afford 1 or 2 classes then take those classes slowly throughout the years and graduate with an AS in maybe 4 years... Stay with the SO until I can afford to leave (unless he matures by then...)
**

*Option #2***: Move back in with my sick mother (fighting cancer), live rent free and go to school full time. I'd work with any free time, but I'd also have to break up with my SO and I don't know how I feel about that right now. I'd also be extremely stressed out because while my mother would be kind enough to allow me to live with her again, she is also a narcissist, pathological liar, expert gaslighter, manipulative, and mentally a child. My father, who lives far far away, is a deadbeat who would rather never be reminded that I exist.

***Option #3***: And this option is hard for me to say because it is cold. My mother told me today that her doctors have ""one more trick up their sleeve"" to help defeat this ever-growing cancer. But in the case it doesn't work, and she does pass on in a year or less, I know there's probably a good $150-200k inheritance I may receive.

I'm so confused.."
17567,bc9qlm,Amd2449,Am I best off to go no contact with my sister?,"Hi,

I've (F 21) been struggling for a while now with the whole situation with my sister (23). We haven't gotten along well in years since I was probably 11 or 12. We have small moments when we get along briefly but for the most part not so much. While, I know that I have not always been the perfect sister, the way that she treats me and other people I just do not agree with.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up, she was always the mean big sister to me and we didn't get along at all but things improved when she moved away and we didn't have to see each much anymore - in fact we went two years without seeing each other (we spoke on the phone occasionally) and it was the most peaceful two years of my life - family wise.  Two years ago she moved to the city where I'm studying at college and she couldn't find a place to live so I moved out of the residence hall so she would have a place to share with someone. Since then it has just been one big downwards spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

Since moving in together she has threatened to ruin my relationship with my parents during fights, told me I have a bad relationship with my boyfriend even though we are perfectly happy and functional, yelled at me for not spending time with her but then yelled at me for never having space and saying she hates living with me, she has said she hates me and she can't wait for me to be gone, she slept with a close friend of mine and then tried to hide it and claimed she felt so guilty when I found it but then continued to do it behind my back for another month until he told me after he called it off because she wasn't nice, she has kicked me out of the apartment when I have had major essays due and had her friends over or her boyfriend over, banished me to my room when she has had her boyfriend over, ate my food many times, told me my degree isn't hard, told me I can't do anything right etc. etc. you get the picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's to the point, where I don't even know if this is what siblings should be like anymore? I feel like it is all too much and living with her has really taken a toll on me emotionally. I am anxious to be in my own house and only go to the kitchen to cook food when she is gone. I hide in my bedroom at all times. I am anxious to interact with her and most of her interactions involve her yelling at me or pretending I don't exist and slamming doors.

&amp;#x200B;

I am moving out in a few months with my partner and I don't know if I should just cease all contact with her when I move out. I really want to because she has made me just miserable for years on end now. However, I don't want to hurt my parents or my brother in doing so. I have no interest in her as a person anymore though - we haven't had a single normal conversation in over two months. She only is nice to me when she wants something from me.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Also, has anyone ever cut off a sibling and regretted it?"

10427,cbpla3,throwawayperson1399,How do I tell my friend he’s in an abusive relationship?,"My friend is in an abusive relationship with my best friend. I can’t tell my best friend she’s abusive, because when I do, she gets super pissed at me. 

She hits him, spits on him, calls him names, ignores him for hours, manipulates him constantly. It’s awful to watch. 

Me and my friends want to help this friend out, but we don’t know how. They’re both in our friend group, and they think they’re in love. 

He’s so much quieter than before they were together. He used to make jokes, hang out with us all the time, be himself. Now, we never see him. She won’t let him come to group hangouts, and is always so quiet now. I haven’t heard a joke from him in forever.

We don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. I’ve known my best friend is abusive. She always is in every relationship. I’ve tried telling her she doesn’t treat her spouses right, she thinks I’m wrong. I feel so bad for my other friend. Advice?"
3396,dbvq17,dlv9,How do I break it to my best friend that I can’t afford to attend her bachelorette party?,"My best friend is getting married next May. We have been friends since middle school. Our friendship has weathered so much, and she is like a sister to me. She’s one of the most kind and selfless people I know. I am one of her bridesmaids.

Last week, the maid of honor (the bride’s sister) emailed all the bridesmaids to tell us that the bride made a decision about her bachelorette party. She wants to have it over a 3 day weekend in Charleston, SC.

I just graduated law school last year. Although I’m fortunate to have found a decent job, I just haven’t been working very long and have not had enough time to save up very much money yet. I live in a very HCOL area, and rent takes up over 50% of my paycheck (despite living with a roommate). I am a public interest lawyer so I don’t make very much to begin with. I have managed to save up about $2,000 so far, but I know I will need that money as an emergency fund.

In contrast, the bride has been out of school for 3 years now (she is a chemical engineer). Her parents still live in the area (unlike mine), and by living at home she has managed to save most of her earnings for the past 3 years. She has well over $150,000 in savings. 

I don’t know if she realizes the financial burden the bachelorette will place on me. Paying for the flight, the hotel/Airbnb, and the food/activities will deplete my emergency savings.

I just don’t feel like I can afford it at this point in my life, and I need to find a way to tell her. I should just tell her outright, but 2 things are holding me back:

1. When she first got engaged, the bride told all the bridesmaids that she didn’t want anyone’s input on anything. She is a people pleaser and has a hard time making decisions on her own, and she didn’t want any of her decisions to be influenced by anyone else’s opinion. She didn’t want to take us dress shopping or talk about anything related to the wedding, like venue, colors, etc. I’m worried that if I tell her I can’t go to the bachelorette, she’ll feel like she’s being influenced to change the location. While I quite honestly wish she would change the location because I would love to attend, that is not my intention at all. I simply can’t afford it.

2. When she was in the process of choosing bridesmaids, the bride told me in confidence that she was strongly considering not asking one of her good friends to be a bridesmaid because she knew that friend would likely be unable to attend the pre-wedding festivities, including the bachelorette. Ultimately, the bride decided to ask the friend to be a bridesmaid anyways, but I know from this conversation how important it is to the bride for us all to attend the bachelorette.

I feel sad that I can’t go. I also feel guilty and like I’m not being a good friend. I also feel frustrated with my friend because I feel like it was presumptuous to assume that everyone would easily be able to afford a trip like this. I know for a fact that, of the 6 bridesmaids, it will be a huge financial burden for 4 of us. It feels like she’s asking for a lot. 

How do I break it to her that I can’t go without making her feel like I’m trying to influence her decision? Am I a terrible friend for missing out on this important event? How can I make it up to her (without spending over $1000 on a trip)?"

A few weeks ago we had an argument because “Sarah” was ignoring me and completely being a bitch while I was walking her home like I’ve done 100 times anyway we’re both really stubborn and today it the first time we’ve spoke since. I have my suspicions she is talking to another boy called Harry but I’m not 100% sure. However there is another girl let’s call her “Tilly” she is supper good looking and really sweet. Me and “Tilly” have met 3 times now and each time has been great but I’m not sure if she’s into me or sees me as a friend. She keeps asking to FaceTime and we do often, she’s even told her dad who I am.

23073,9evn2o,DiscombobulatedEye9,My friend broke my $350 headphones,"A few months ago me and a few friends were at another friends house and one of them didn't have headphones, but wanted to listen to music. I offered mine, it was supposed to just be for the time we were there, but I guess she misinterpreted and took them home. I asked her about it and she apologized and said she'd give them back to me as soon as she could. Every time I pestered her about it she would have another reason she couldn't get them to me at the time. Finally she gives them back to me, beaten up and moldy. She casually mentions ""Oh yeah, they don't work unless I shove the cord in in a certain way"". While I was a little mad at the state they were returned in, I figured if I just bought a new cord they'd work fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few weeks, the cord arrives and when I put it in, only one side works and it BARELY works. I try to get a replacement under warranty but I can't because I bought them from Amazon and the company only fulfills the warranty if they were bought from their site. So I message her telling her this, she says ""that's unfortunate"". I ask her ""So, you're going to help me replace them, right?"" she says she can't afford it, and she doesn't know what to tell me. I mean I get it, I'm broke too, but shouldn't it be a general rule to not borrow something you can't afford to replace? It's all well and good to say you're sorry but you're not the one down $350. 

&amp;#x200B;

We used to be really close friends but even barring this she's been getting on my nerves more and more lately, and this is just another annoyance on top of all of that. I don't know how to proceed. I don't really want to take legal action or anything like that but I don't feel like it's acceptable to do something like this. "

I'm 18 y/o and feel really down recently. I spent almost my entire highschool playing computer games and don't have a close friend group or any close friends that I hang out with other than online. I'm not out of shape, I workout regularly now and have a job but nothing to be happy about since I'm not in really good shape and my job is pretty lame. I have never even really had a relationship in my life (partly because there wasn't really anyone I was attracted to who wasn't single), let alone kissed a girl, which I find pathetic about myself. I know it isn't that big of a deal but it feels like it is to me. I just feel that everything I do is nothing special and that there are thousands+ who are better than me in any aspect of my life and was wondering how you guys keep such a high self image even though there are much more people better than you. I've tried not comparing to others but it just doesn't work very well because I always find myself doing it, mostly for people who are younger than me and doing better than me."

- 28 yo

- Graduated with top grades in Computer Science

- Always had excellent job reviews/feedback

- Seen as a leader in my team at work

- Most people who knows me think I'm smart

- Deep inside, I know I'm not smart but hard-worker.

- I'm highly competitive with others. Not in a harsh way or making it public, but I constantly compare myself with others. (Huge explanation of my scores/skills/achievements).

- I'm constantly trying to adquire new skills to keep being different from others.


I'm starting to realize that I'm constantly improving my skills to keep holding the image other people have about me.

Even when I think I'm learning things I really like, most of the time I'm struggling with high anxiety of achieving mastery.


So, in escence my feelings are:

- I'm really unhappy about my behaviour.

- Even though I know that what others think about me shouldn't be a huge deal, somehow I can't control it.


I can't figure out what should I do. This doesn't seem to have an easy fix, and it seems that I should commit to some kind of new habits or ways of thinking to start finding my true self.


I'd appreciatte any advice to change the situation I'm in.


Thanks.

I've been told I'm not allowed to in anyway lay a hand on a intruder even if my life is on the line, I am to comply. Now under normal circumstances I'd simply quit walk out the door myself, accept I need the financial assistance right now.

I wouldn't be posting this if I didn't feel like I'm simply fodder for the  depraved wolves to feed on. I've expressly asked NOT to be placed on ""door gaurd"" after the first instance I was warned not to defend myself, which seems to have had the exact opposite effect on things. As I am here now.

This is the first time I actually feel in danger at a job and it's becoming daily I get assigned to this position while once a week I have a run in with a unreasonable  daranged man or woman. Management seems completely unconcerned with my safety or the fact that I'm supposed to be""a first casualty""  if a interaction turns violent. I'm seasonal if this helps for reference, and constantly reminded of that , An told my job is expendable. Management consists of all fairly decent people but some how I continue to end up in this undesirable position.

If you fail on either step that's ok you can try again.  If you get turned down on either step that's also ok, you can stop wasting your time pining for this person and start pining for a new person.

Secret bonus tip:  Most people like talking about themselves so in step 2 try talking to the person about themselves.

4301,d7c4jm,throwawae5,"I am desperate, lack confidence and probably suffer from social anxiety or something (m15)","So first it's important to know that I'm right now on a 3 month long exchange in France and I obviously have some problems with understanding the locals, even though my French is quite good. I go to a school and am in a class where they're also all new and they (for the most part) don't know each other, so I think that's good. The problems I list here are referring to my current situation, but they also exist at home in Germany where I go to a boarding school for gifted children. 

A few years back I was EXTREMELY focused on school, my parents made me visit half a dozen psychotherapist, which I all hated, they told me I was borderline depressed. I literally woke up at 3 am to study Italian, I had extreme lack of sleep and was extremely stressed. (Just want to note here that my parents had nothing to do with this, they told me that my grades wouldn't matter to them and they did all they could) Logically, I had virtually zero social interaction outside my family and one close friend with whom I often talked in the breaks. In my class there wasn't a single person I liked, I looked down on them (for I thought I was smarter than then) and was annoyed when they tried talking to me. 
This study obsession somehow just stopped when I realized that grades don't matter in the earlier school years (in Germany at least, I don't know much about the American school system). I still didn't meet any friends or anything and disliked the people in my class.

I am afraid this state of depression will return when I write my ""Abitur"" (graduation from high school) and my grades will actually be important for life, I'm so fucking anxious and have high expectations. 

Next up: I don't know if this is just an introvert thing or social anxiety or something else. I never feel comfortable in groups. Not back in Germany, not here in France. People genuinely like me and I also like the people in the group but I just can't enjoy myself. I love hanging out with one or two of my close friends at home, but with more people that aren't like best friends I feel myself zoom out of conversation and not know how to participate. I try to do more and more with people improve my social skills (also to find a girlfriend but more on that later) but I just hate it. 

Next insecurity is my height and face. As far as height goes, well I'm short. I hope and think that I'll still grow, as for my brother it was the same, and he is know like average height. The other thing is that my face is really round and child like. I'm not ugly but I feel like puberty just hasn't really begun for me, despite my age. (Also genital size will hopefully still increase lol and I don't have like any hair under my arms, little facial hair development). This makes me feel like I am not ready for dating/ that it wouldn't be appropriate even though I feel mentally ready (i am NOT talking about sex here just like boyfriend/girlfriend stuff) 

I feel like my lack of ""visual age dependant development""(idk how to call it) and social capability is really unattractive and I have just been lowering my standards now until I'd be willing to go with virtually anyone. 

Over the last few days I've been reaching out to a girl friend in my boarding school and think she might be willing to be my gf. I really like hear, but I feel like I am not in love with her and would only do that to boost my ego and out of desperation. Also I don't want to toy with the girls emotions and be an asshole to her. 

So that's my story. I had three ""relationships"" when I was younger, two with the same girl where it was actually like a relationship where we would go out and kiss (just like children, without tounge or anything) and the other doesn't even count as we would just like write and we went out ONCE in a break and like talked and that's it, we didn't even hold hands or anything. 

Also I don't have a problem with some ""feats"" of confidence like dancing vigorously as literally the only one on school partys (I told you I go to a boarding school, nobody would invite me to an actual party), but afterwards I feel really ridiculous and as if everyone laughed at me, what they do I guess. 
I have one really close friends (and others that really like me, and for everyone else im sympathetic I guess(but I don't feel like I can talk to anyone, my roommate and best friend always gets annoyed when I talk about more serious stuff and tells me to shut up. 

(Also what does it mean if girls tell you your cute?)

Thought I might post this here, would appreciate some advice from y'all but I'm already glad if anybody even reads this. I don't want to see a psychotherapist. I have made extremely bad experience with numerous ""professionals"".

I have only one week to deadline...,"I am a master student writing my thesis in quantitative finance field and I am not sure my thesis supervisor is technically able to follow my thesis? I mean, I understand that not all thesis supervisors are experts in all fields in finance but am I really expected to dumb it down to a level that a high school student can understand it? I could have finished my thesis a week ago yet I keep watering it down to completely ridiculous levels. I feel like I am writing a textbook and not a thesis as I constantly explain terms and processes than any master student should understand. He is telling me that my thesis should be readable by general public? But i feel like that is b***hit? What part of general public reads quantitative finance papers? only people who are into it, who probably know what I am talking about or can at least google and do a bit of self study to understand what I am talking about. I mean i dont go reading a Journal of Biomedical Science or Physics? of course i wont understand anything. 
Am i being unreasonable? If not, what should I do? i am really scared that he is going to grade me down because he cant follow it which is such a shame as i spend almost a year on my research :("

About a month ago, our downstairs neighbor left a note saying we were too noisy and that he has to wake up at 5 am everyday and we are disrupting his sleep, potentially endangering him at his construction job. My roommates and I were sympathetic and we started playing tv with headsets, wearing slippers, dragging our feet, etc. We also wrote back a note with all our numbers so he can contact us if we were noisy so we knew exactly what caused the noise. The issue is, all of my roommates and I are students and work full time, so we all get home at like 1-2am. So we are making dinner or studying or getting ready for bed at later hours of the night. He has messaged me a few times now complaining about me walking around at about 3 am (I’m usually making dinner and showering at this time). We already have carpet for our floors and have no speakers on the floor and have limited how often we walk. I just don’t know what else to do. 

TL;DR: My downstairs neighbor and I have opposite schedules so I get noise complaints from walking because he’s sleeping when I’m awake. I have carpeted floors and wear slippers and drag my feet."

27446,8rzmtv,trhnwy,(Relationship) Should I break up ?,"I have been going out with this guy for the past year and I honestly don't know what to do anymore. 

We are from different nationalities and I moved to his country to live closer to him and keep the relationship going, since we met during summer vacation last year. It began as a back and forth relationship but with very strong feelings, which is why I decided to move here. In the other country things were not going well and I didn't have more study reasons to keep me there. And I love this new city I'm living in. 

About my boyfriend, he's not the most boyfriend material kinda guy. He's 28 and apparently I'm the first person he's actually dated longer than a couple of months. The problem is he's really immature and selfish sometimes. I'm starting to realize he's not as into me as I am into him and he's not ready to make efforts to show love.   
We've had a lot of fights, our whole relationship is based on fights since I've tried very hard to explain to him certain relationship aspects (that you would expect from someone who's 28) but he's absolutely clueless about. He's left me down so many times and whenever I tried to explain it to him, or how I felt, or how I think we could work better, he turns defensive, childish, generalizes behaviours and yells. 

Thurday we had an argument, he was talking about doing stuff for my birthday and travelling to a place he's already gone with a friend in the past. He has a past with this friend and we've done some trips that he said the same thing, how he's done that with her before. I didn't mind it before because she's actually our friend who introduced us, I'm not going to be jealous of their past, but for my birthday I wanted to do something new with him, not something that he has already done. He got mad at me, we fought and that was it. I tried to come and see him saturday to lighten things up and hang out, he was moody and nothing I did made anything better. Sunday I was feeling bad, because I'm currently doing treatment for an infection and I have some liver pain and was feeling down a bit. I asked if we could meet up and hang out, he had a lot of excuses and we didn't see each other. This morning I asked if he was ok, and wished him to have a nice week. He said that he feels better but he was still mad at me for the fight. I just can't do it anymore.

How can you approach someone who doens't open, who doesn't try to understand you ?

Is he really immature and inexperienced or he simply doesn't care?"
8002,cnhzf1,anothernafwthrowaway,I can't stop sleep depriving myself,"Help. I don't know why but for the past few months I haven't been able to bear going to sleep unless I'm on the verge of passing out from exhaustion. And I have no idea why. Whenever I try to go to bed early I'm reminded of a million things I need/want to, and stay up till 4 or 5am, sometimes even later, doing very few or even none of the things I wanted to do. Even if I force myself into bed and don't have my phone or laptop in the room I feel an overwhelming urge to do literally anything that ISN'T sleeping. Something to note is that the more sleep I get, the worse I feel in the morning, regardless of where in my sleep cycles I wake up. I'm not sure if it's me being accustomed to sleeping 15 hours a week or if I'm subconsciously craving feeling less groggy for a few hours after waking up, but I really need to fix this. I never cared about potential health impacts but recently I've begun microsleeping pretty heavily when I'm in boring situations (one or two classes at school, in particular.) It's starting to affect my grades in those classes, and my ability to cram the night before is getting less and less effective. 

That being said, even if I force myself into falling asleep early, there is another dilemma: I'm a chronic procrastinator. Although my sleepless nights aren't very productive, they are still by far the most productive hours of my day on average. Often I'll keep myself awake literally by doing stuff that otherwise I would have no motivation to do, such as playing video games I've been thinking about playing for a while or doing some programmimg (not schoolwork though, cause I guess some work is just worse than other work?)  This has made it really rough to try to go to sleep early as I feel like I achieved nothing that day (which I have). Is there anyone struggling with anyone similar, or has any tips on how I can overcome this?

Thanks."
83,ejxixl,socialskills100,Boyfriend pressures me into meeting his family,"I told him from the very beginning that I did not want to be introduced to his family and I did not need for him to meet mine. I just have bad experiences, have struggled with social anxiety, and I like to think that we nearing that age where we pull away from family a little. He even said that he didn’t plan on telling his parents of any future girlfriends, that’s just not something he did (due to bad experiences).

Well a couple of months goes by and now we have been dating for more or a less 2 weeks. He’s been pressuring me to meet his family for at least a week. He did say hi to my mom like 3 times because I live at home still (he doesnt) and sometimes he has picked me up or dropped me off. He claims to have met my brother, but I don’t really remember that happening. 

Today his sister (who he has cut off) is throwing her birthday party and he went. I don’t understand why he went, considering he actually cut her off? But he pressured me into going for a few days and we even had a minor fight about it. There are gonna be 20 family members there. He said that he had met my mom and brother so it was only fair. Also he said “you wanna put our relationship on Facebook, but not meet my family? K”

I feel like it’s only fuck boys who don’t put their relationships on Facebook? Which he confirmed me in like an hour later by showing a message he got from his fuck boy friend. But I never forced him to make it public, I just said that I would like to, and he agreed after a while.

So what do I do about this situation? He visibly looks hurt when I say I don’t want to meet his family, and I don’t need him to meet mine. But it’s been 14 DAYS. I don’t even feel like he’s my boyfriend yet, because it’s so early. But I’m 20 and he’s 19, I don’t see why I have to meet his whole family? His family even has a rule “no meeting of partners until the relationship has lasted 3 months.”

How do I explain that it’s way too early for me? He’s pushing me away."

Whenever I do or say something that makes him really really angry, he usually uses physical reprimands. They don’t happen very often at all, before tonight the last one i remember is when he was 17 I think. 
He spilled a gallon of milk and it seemed like just left our mom to clean it up because he walked away without explanation (apparently to get towels from the closet). 
My mom went off at him and he yelled back, I can’t remember exactly what he said but I do know he was belittling her intelligence. 
At this point I do something very stupid and tell them that the only he calls her an idiot is when he is trying to cover for his own embarrassment over his mistakes. Immediately he turned and slapped me across the face.
This time it was because I wouldn’t pet our dog when she was whining and started barking to the point where he had to pet her to quiet her down. He hit me hard across the side of my head and that’s pretty much that.
I think I’m overreacting but I also feel so belittled and small and like I’m less than nothing whenever it happens. I feel frustrated and angry and upset but there’s no where for those feeling to go so I’m putting them here. 
Is this normal? What should I do if it’s not?

31560,89mb8w,cooldawg11,Will I be single forever?,"I am 21F and my boyfriend of 5 years recently broke up with me pretty unexpectedly. For the first couple weeks I was feeling fine and was able to see all of the things that were wrong with our relationship and come to terms with it. Now, I feel like I am really starting to feel the pain. A week or so ago I made a tinder account, which was a big deal because I never ever take pictures of myself so I never thought I would use the app. I originally wanted to use the app to maybe find someone for casual sex because I was with my boyfriend since I was 16 so I never got to experience anything of the sort and always thought I was missing out. 

I met up with a guy from tinder and we hooked up. I am almost certain that he won't contact me again just because I could tell he wanted it to be a one time thing - he had just broken up with his long term gf.  Basically, I am realizing that I could never do a friends with benefits/hook up arrangement because I get way too attached to people I meet. Also, it makes me feel totally worthless afterwards. I'm having a hard time thinking about how I will ever find a relationship again just because I do struggle socially (social anxiety and just introverted-ness). I don't have many friends. 

So, now that I realized that I cannot handle flings and hook ups I just want to know if there is any hope for me to actually find a serious boyfriend in my future (next few years) because I am really feeling as though most guys are only looking for sex and nothing serious. I'm feeling hopeless because I am super shy and I don't have friends to set me up with anyone etc. I just want to know if there is hope for someone like me. "
3625,daqhb1,UnadventurousHaida,"My mum who doesn’t have a great deal of money consistently buys me, my husband and our animals gifts that aren’t necessary or useful. How do I ask her to not just buy gifts for the sake of gifts?","So my partner and I (both 24) work decent paying full time jobs. If we require something we can generally afford to get it for ourselves.
My mum (54) and her husband (50), on the other hand both have survivable, but low paying full time jobs. They have enough money to go out for lunches, regularly buy random home items from shops like Kmart and Target and also more specialty gift shops. They at least once a year require personal loans to make some bigger purchases or to pay off other personal loans and they are not making any solid plans for their future retirement.  (They don’t own a home, limited superannuation, regular spending on eating out, gifts, home decor, cars etc) and I am seriously concerned for their future. 

My mum is a beautiful, genuine person who obviously loves her friends and family, but I don’t know how to ask her to stop gifting us random useless items without hurting her. We appreciate the thought and  her wanting to gift us things, but we would prefer just time spent with her rather than what feels like spending money for the sake of spending money. 

The last few years my mum has put together gift boxes for special events/holidays. These gift boxes, while bought in love, miss the mark completely on what we need or want. 
We don’t need regular animal toys/treats, woolly bed socks, razors/personal hygiene items, face masks, creams, trinkets, snacks/chocolates, PJs, T-shirts, etc. 
I also do not live locally currently so if we aren’t around for the gift giving she spends $20-25 per gift box on postage to send these random gifts to us. 

Personally, the items gifted aren’t overly useful to us, so they become clutter and dust gatherers. I am also genuinely worried about what her future will look like in retirement at the current rate they spend money. 
I also want to try and nicely put a stop or lessen this gifting to us before we have children too, because I can see her very regularly buying gifts for the child that aren’t necessary or that become clutter. 

Any advice on how to discuss this without sounding ungrateful and with minimal hurt feelings would be appreciated."

I do not have a quick thinking, dominant personality. When I communicate my goal is not to prove others wrong. She corrects, chastises, critiques and challenges others when she communicates.

Anyway, I don't do any of that and some of my co-workers seem to hate me because of it. Today, for example, during my break I wanted to buy food, so I order and then added a drink to it.

8192,cmhbfe,GageDaRemixer,I feel like my personality sucks... How do I fix it including overthinking problems?,"So, I’m a sensitive teenage guy who doesn’t personally seem to care about anyone at one point, and turn out to be loving in the other. Love always comes first for me and one of my family members. I have a good sense of humor,  and I have a girlfriend who seems to love and care about me a lot. I’m getting the feeling that she doesn’t say anything nice about me and talks to one of her friends about some shitty moments I’ve had with her. I love her to death and all, but from what my mom told me was that she always runs her mouth as usual. Whenever I make a least favorite point about her, she gets so defensive over the fact why my mom and I don’t like the things she does and crap. 

Hell, I’ve seen some other girls who talk about their boyfriends a lot: “Oh, he’s so nice, you guys should see him!”. I never in my life got that. Before my girlfriend ended up preventing being “sisters” with her best friend, they were joking about me and shit, and she thinks that I have anger issues (which I fucking don’t). I like the idea about them joking with me, but I take that sort of shit as offense. Me and my girlfriend have four fights over bullshit since 3-4 months back, but that’s all in the past, I guess. 

I have gotten 80s in all subjects except for science, which was in mid-70s. When I started as a freshman in my new private high school, I didn’t get the honor roll. But I somehow surpassed my English final after when school is done. Before the finals, I told my girlfriend that I wasn’t smart, and she got in the finals. I’m not jealous or anything, but I’m honestly really proud of her. She said that I didn’t need to get the honor roll, and that I tried my best. I was so pissed to hear that last sentence, but you know. Live and learn, right? 

I feel like things are normal for every boyfriend and girlfriend, and there’s just me not knowing what to say, except for the fact I keep complementing her about her looks and everything else. I don’t socialize really well, and I don’t speak right either which sucks fucking ass. I feel sort of awkward whenever I’m around with her, unless we go in a conversation on FaceTime to talk about our summer or shit. When I asked her if I’m awkward over the phone, she says she doesn’t. But in the inside, I’m getting the feeling she’s bullshitting me.  I have low self-esteem and I’m not sort of an upbeat person towards everyone. I get happy all the time, my mom says I don’t have any problems. It’s just that I am really shy and overthinking too much, just like what my girlfriend says to me over the phone one day. Im getting the feeling that she doesn’t want a guy like me, but she will always love me. I don’t know why but I can feel that nobody’s gonna take me seriously at all, but it’s all in my head, you know?

Am I overthinking too much? What would i do? Is it hard to have a good upbeat personality like the others and try to change? What do you think guys?"
3237,dcu1i7,Irisveile14,I (F21) was harassed by a male coworker (M35) and now I’m scared to go work. What do I do?,"So at our organization we have had a lot of new hirees in the past month. This new guy, Rafeal, has been peculiar. He isn’t really friendly, has had multiple complaints against him, and I found out Monday has been harassing the other female employees. How? He gets in their personal space, yells at them, and he even grabbed one girls purse to keep her from leaving. A female employee caught him forging documents last week and it was reported. Rafeal got in her face and grabbed her purse. 

When he confronted me it was when I was supposed to talk with the girls about him to both our managers. The girls (4 in total) have reported him. My bosses boss was actually there because the girls and I planned to talk to our boss about the incident before Rafeal got in a confrontation with me. 

Then, this past week, I had an encounter with him. I was asked by my boss to help assist him with an assignment and I told him I was. I tell him the work is good and it’s a good job, then he goes off on me. He says, “don’t talk to me like I’m stupid you think I’m stupid or something”. I’m stunned and I tried to explain and he kept on, raising his voice, “you think you’re so perfect, but you’re just a fake. Quit talking to me like I’m 10... you’re not the boss of me... what did I ever to do make you hate me, tell me”! He also said, “you’ve had it out for me since day 1”. At that he got in my personal space and tried to grab me and I ran to my boss. 

My boss told me to go home and honestly, I’m embarrassed to say, I cried about it. I’ve never had a coworker yell at me or even talk to me like that before. I don’t understand what I did wrong. Sure I don’t like that he has harassed the other female employees, but I have never been rude/mean to this guy.

My mom had me (23m) at a young age (14). From what I’ve known she’s always had reckless, risk-taking, careless, ruthless personality, but for a small period diring child she did care to my emotional needs as much as she could, but as time went on she just lost it.  
In these last 23 years of my life she’s manage to have 2 more kids, my little brothers (12 &amp; 5) and countless abortions due to her sleeping around. She’s been to jail numerous times, for months and years at a time and has put me, my brothers, our family, and others lives in risk while being under the influence multiple times. (Driving while high, leaving little brothers alone as babies, doing drugs with them while pregnant and multiple other painful things) so due to that she lost her custody of them and they are now under foster with my grandma (her mom)..

So as you can see I’ve had a pretty wicked life. Now my issue is as of recently she’s been stealing money from family members and me to get high, using drugs more heavily, smoking it in our house with her drug friends and just  has been overall unstable. Just recently she put Reese’s cups into my grandfather’s car fuel tank because he wouldn’t lend her $20 which caused his car to get totaled. 

Just this morning we got into an argument because she decided to come into the bathroom and smoke PCP while I was in the shower. I told her to please put it out yet she insisted that “she wasn’t bothering me” so in response I smacked it out her hand. In return she per usual snapped on me and told me I’m going to pay for it someway or another, and by that she went in my room, into my wallet and stole my $100 to go buy it. When I noticed what she did I left out the house to go find her and get my money back (which resulted in a scuffle between us) and unfortunately cops were rolling by and seen me on top of her so they decided to handcuff me.... after running my name they seen that I was clean and a good guy and let me go. But what’s so sane is that even after seeing the cops wrestle me to the ground she lied and said she didn’t steal my money, which she’s done.

Honestly I’m just tired. She’s ruined my childhood from her drug addiction, from showing up to parent teacher meetings, birthdays and graduations high. She’s ruined my little brothers from drug addiction from smoking with them giving them behavioral issues . She’s ruined jobs, financial situations and lost houses from it ... and idk... I’m just tired. Unfortunately I have to be in the same house as her until me and my girl get our living situation right which should be by February, but as of now I need something to be done. Every family knows about her problem and gave up on her and could give a shit about me so I have no where to go to. Please help with your most helpful advice"
7369,cqr7ji,lskow4,Relationship advice,"My girlfriend thinks I am addicted to video games. I play maybe 5 hours a week (if that) and the only time I really get to play is when I get home from work (because I get home before her). She doesn't like that I want to play any chance that I can. Playing is something that I thoroughly enjoy and it's not like I'm playing games that make me (and everyone) rage such as PUBG Fortnite Apex etc. I am a casual world of warcraft player as of now. I used to game a ton before I met her (hours per day) and stream, I even became an affiliate with twitch. She has no idea what being addicted was. Gaming is a hobby of mine. She has no hobbies so all she does when I play is wonder when I am going to be done. She thinks gaming is clouding my desire to think of things to do for her. Like the cute shit that I would do when we first started dating. I still do things like this, just not to her standard. which is ALL about her. If it's not 100% her way it's not for her. I don't know what to do because I told her I will not get rid of the games and she isn't happy about it. But I have done more for her than she seems to realize and made more sacrifices than she seems to realize and I will not give up something I enjoy doing even if it's only for an hour a day here and there."
36672,7s990d,imgonnamissuman,My friends dad just beat the shit out of him in front of me and five other people for having a vape and the vape wasn't even his,"So me and my friends were chilling and just listening to music or sleeping at my friends house, all of us between 16 and 18 years old, and a few of us 18 year olds have vapes. Friend's dad comes home, sees a vape, takes it (he knew it wasn't his kid's), told my friend (who's 18), that he can have his vape back if his parents call him. He says okay and he's sorry yadda yadda yadda. 

My friend goes upstairs to talk to him (he's 17), and all we heard was this giant commotion, my friend yelling ""don't fucking hit me! Dont fucking hit me! If you touch me I'll fucking kill You! Stop!"". 

This has happened before but there were never any witnesses until now. All the girls who were there were crying and us guys were just in shock and didn't know what to do. He came out to grab his backpack as we were leaving and his face looked pretty bad and his brother didn't look too good either. 


What can we do? His home life gives him major depression and now we know the extent."

20956,au1rng,CaptnPilot,25 years old with no direction in life. Took a major leap last week and now I'm freaking tf out.,"I spent 6 years working with one company and going to school. The first 3 years were ridiculously hard, then I got moved to a cake ass job. Literally doing almost nothing, stress free, everyday. It's a union job too so the benefits were good and all that, just the pay was kind of low, at least until you've been there 20 years and get a big raise.

 I got my degree in Communications. All the entry level job listings I saw were ""3 years experience required, $10/hour"" like wtf is that really how it is?! So I did nothing, just continued to work my easy ass job doing nothing. Then a year passed... it felt like a week. Nothing happened, I did nothing. If I did this for 20 years my whole life would flash by. Not wanting to waste my entire life, I applied for a management position. Had the interview, and got the job. 

This past week I have been in the training course, next week is the last week. It looks... very overwhelming and I only hear horror stories about being a manager at this place. I almost had a couple panic attacks and my hands have been sweating and I don't have any more finger nails to bite. I don't smoke anymore but this past week I've smoked about 2 packs of cigarettes because I think I may have just made the biggest mistake of my life. This shit of going to be crazy hard, more hours, dealing with union employees that can get away with almost anything, and anything that goes wrong is automatically my fault, FUCK!!

Left the union for management position because I was bored with life and wanted something more. Now I'm nervous that I made the wrong decision and I'll have to quit, get some bs dead end job like Walmart cashier and live with my parents forever or some crazy shit like that. If I do end up quitting, how am I suppose to get a good job when they all want years of experience and pay $10/hour... Like... what did i just do..."
6659,cu7zoe,AegonBlackfyre_,I’ve had to deal with people spreading rumors about me being like a school shooter for the past year and I don’t know what to do anymore.,"For some reason, ever since the beginning of 2019 around the places I’ve been, people I don’t know have been saying that I look like I could be the next school shooter due to the depressive state I was in. I don’t think I personally look the type as if it was banter, as I always dress preppy and hold myself politely in conversation. It’s gotten to the point where people hate me before even meeting me and it really takes a toll on my mental health, which had recovered to a good point recently. I don’t even want to face people anymore Bc I know who’s spreading these things and I have to see them when I go to class. I’m a pretty sensitive person in general and I want to know what I can do to cope or to help myself out of this hole. I know I can’t fix people as they’ll always be asses but I want something to change."
7424,cqj08v,lmk0714,Saw my “employer” sending a racist email about me and other coworkers,"So basically, my employer is my patient. They’re under direct funding which means that they hire and fire their attendants as they choose. I have no higher authority to report to; as far as I know (someone correct me if I am wrong). 

Long story short, as I was doing some chores for my patient/“employer” is saw them writing a racist email saying; “ I don’t like the Indian attendants there is a way that they provoke me and their too calculated, selfish and emotional” later in the email she says me and another attendant have no class. 

I have faced a lot of problems with this patient (I made another post before this one) and so have the other attendants. There was a time were she called me a bullshitter and ungrateful because I didn’t add up the total hours on my time sheet; even after I explained that it’s my first time using a written time sheet and I didn’t know. I never felt so embarrassed and upset in my whole life. My patients gotten mad at me because I didn’t want to mop they’re other family member living area although I offered to just sweep instead and mop if it’s visibly dirty. This patient/employer doesn’t have any cognitive disabilities and they are fully capable of thinking for their own hence they have been granted the right to hire and fire their own attendants. Which makes it harder for me to let her actions slide.

Basically, I’m at a loss for what I should do. I have voiced my opinion about they way they treat me and the others a whole bunch of times. I’m basically stuck quitting my job and not being able to get a reference letter.  I don’t mean to sound like a complainer, and I know as a psw I should suck it up because we all get difficult patients, but my jobs already really hard and it’s harder having to face criticism on every shift. I’m trying really hard not to quit because it’s harder on the spouse and the spouse doesn’t deserve to have to struggle. Any ideas about how to go with this situation? How can I put this job on my resume if they’re going to have to contact my patient who I know won’t say anything good about me."
18394,b7i9cs,TheodoreSanders,"20 year old trapped at home, need help. I wrote an e-mail to send to different groups that I’ll share here explaining my situation.","I have recently turned 20 and I live in Virginia. I have been homeschooled my entire life, I need urgent help and I don’t know who to turn to. This may be long, I apologise, and may contain topics that some find sensitive.

I am the son of an active duty soldier. I have moved across many states and even to Europe- the entire time being homeschooled. I have never had a real friend since my parents forbid me, for no particular reason, from going outside by myself. Even now, aged 20, I’m only allowed to walk in front of the house. The only friends I’ve ever had are ones I’ve made online that I must keep secret in case my parents find out and block all access to the outside world. Since age 14 being trapped and alone for so long has made me suffer from what I can only presume is depression, since my mother avoids and thus prevents me to get medical help due to her absurd mistrust of doctors. It has gotten worse over time and I feel hopeless constantly until my close friends online manage to distract me from the pain.
It got so bad that I felt suicidal- even going so far as planning to use my father’s gun despite being so scared to end my life in 2015- until I made friends online who helped me get through the horrible loneliness. Without these friends I don’t know if I would’ve been able to make it this far. This makes it even harder to try and push boundaries since my mother will threaten to take my ipod away (she doesn’t allow me to have my own phone), which I avoid because I don’t know if I can manage alone without my friends. She often threatens to take everything away and shut me in my room with nothing if I try press for more freedom to live life like normal twenty year olds do.

I’m worried not just for myself but for my siblings as well. My sister is about to turn 18 and I’m scared both she and my brother are going to have to go through all this too. My father doesn’t care about what happens at home and spends his time at work or watching TV. I need help because I’m now 20 years old and it looks like my mother is determined to keep me from leaving the house still. Any talks of college have died and my mother is using ‘waiting until we move to New York’ as her latest excuse- which wouldn’t even happen until late 2020. She treats me like a child and I still can’t venture outside on my own, not even to go to the nearby library or the grocery store without heavy consequences.(edited)
At this rate I feel like I’ll be trapped with my controlling parents for the rest of my life and I’m worried I will never have my own life away from here. Please help me or provide information of an organisation that could help me. "
2822,deysyq,padster029,I'm losing my best friend please help,"A bit of background first, I am 16M and she is 16F. We went to a school together and we were best friends but now our schools are 10 miles apart so we hardly see each other.

So we used to be best friends but now since we hardly see each other our friendship has started to fall apart. I've tried to arrange to meet up with her but every time she has an excuse why she cant, and she doesn't arrange to meet up. We usually text to talk to each other, as that's the only way we can talk.  But it is always me who starts conversations and she always replies with one word or one sentence, hardly putting any effort in. It never used to be like this, we used to talk for hours on end only about a year ago. But now every conversation is cut short as she doesn't put any effort in. She has recently said that she doesn't like people as much who constantly talk to her, so I've given her space and stopped talking to her as much as I used to, but nothing's changed. I've tried talking to her but everytime we always end up in a bad mood and once we didn't talk to each other for a few weeks after. I recognised that was partly my fault so I apologised. We used to have so much fun talking to each other, but now I just feel sad as I know our friendship may never be what it was like. I know you might say ""well just end the friendship if you aren't happy"", but I don't want to end a friendship we've worked so hard to create and she isn't like the rest of my friends, she's never judged me and I can tell her anything, and recently she added me to her private story on snapchat only for her best friends so we are still friends. I've tried many things such as reminding her of what our friendship used to be like and asking if anything is wrong but nothing has changed. The last conversation we had I was telling her I'd been on holiday to a theme park and she just replied with nice so I decided to tell her what all the rides were like and she replied with nice. So if anyone has any suggestions about what I should do or what I should say to restore our friendship, I would greatly appreciate it. I understand that we may not be as bestest of friends when we first became friends but I would still like to call her my friend."

7478,cq8npf,Lolaidenzeal,Good for nothing spoiled 16 year old wanting to change for his future,"I am the youngest child in my family, the age gap between my siblings and I is about 10 years apart. My brother and sister are living their adult lives earning and building their futures. I am the youngest in the family, and have been spoiled and my guilt keeps building.  I am like a leech, taking all of their kindness they give to me while giving them nothing. Everything I have is because of my siblings and my parents. My gaming computer that my brother bought the parts for and built, the television I didn't ask for that my father bought me, the PlayStation 4 that I barely play on anymore, all those things given to me and I don't give back. Anything I really want will be handed to me.

These past few years I have avoided asking for anything on my birthday or for any Christmas present that isn't clothes and underwear. 
I want to show them they didn't waste their time and hard earned money on someone who would be useless in life, but I can't. Because to me, that would mean having to grow up and take action. 

This summer I have spent a majority of it playing video games in my room, taking rests by lying in my bed and browsing on my phone only to get back up to play more games. I've barely gone outside the house and only leave my room to eat downstairs then come back up and play some more. I'm going nowhere in life at this rate. Some of the blame could be that I am constantly being enabled by my family to continue my ways, but i feel that I can only blame myself for this. For my laziness and my inability to be real with myself, real enough to spark a meaningful change that will last.

This has lead me to feel incredibly guilty with myself. A good for nothing spoiled son who lies and only takes for himself. I want to change, I know I can, many others have changed their lives for the better before so I can too right? I just need my first big step. But that is where I am afraid. Every time I fail, I fallback to my life of video games. I have failed multiple times to nail interviews and get jobs. The walk to the gym is 30 minutes, making me lazy to go there. My motivation is low but I know I must make changes otherwise everything my family has given or done for me will be for nothing and I will turn out to be nothing.

What steps can I take to grow up and start taking responsibility as a young adult and get myself prepared for adulthood on my own?

Maybe it is a lack of motivation mixed with my laziness or it has nothing to do with motivation and more about my weakness as a person. I just want to feel useful and have a future. I feel as the summer break continues, I can sense my family's disappointment in me growing. I can feel it when my mother looks at me, even if I have my back turned I can almost feel her eyes looking at this failure. The dissapointed face my father made when he saw the mess of clothes all over my room and realized the state of me right now. I feel like shit. Because I am shit."

I have found that nothing in life gives me for satisfaction than helping others. I would like to find a career in which I could do this on a regular basis but am at a loss as to what exactly to do. I have a bachelors degree in a social science and have worked in some form of management my entire life. I am an adult with ADHD and have particularly poor executive functioning. Thus I’ve always found it rather difficult paying attention and managing time but have always been fortunate enough to have a secretary or staff beneath me to handle these things for me. I excel at working and communicating with others and have learned in adulthood (though being “hyper-active” my concentration often tends to be lacking,) how to become “hyper focused,” especially when doing something I enjoy- and there is nothing I enjoy more than working with others. 
Can you guys help me out in finding a career where I can help others but is less clerical than most jobs? Or a least point me in the right direction? I’ve strongly considered teaching but became demoralized in college when finding others on the same path seemed to be pursuing pedagogy for a paycheck, rather than the exceedingly important role of educating and empowering our youth. And I also worry that I will be less successful in this type of career when it comes to deadlines and lesson planning.
 
If anyone out there has any advice or input, it would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks so much!"
31467,8a1iyy,MadMarch2,"Boss says I have a BAD accent, what should I do?","Hi fellow world citizens.

I've been working in an agency for about 2 years and in the recent months I got a promotion that has me sharing an office with my supervisor.
Since I am not English native speaker and I have only been her for 7 years so I am very  aware of my accent. I am not ashamed of it but if it wasn't around I wouldn't really cry about it.
Family and friends and a couple of SO I've had over the last few years ignore my accent or have told me they really like it. 
My boss on the other hand is a low key racist, saying things like ""he is from Iran, he was raised different, he was raised wrong "" and ""if people weren't born here they should get out"".
She has, for the most part, been nice to me, since she knows I'm a US citizen and because when she says jump I ask how high.
We talk a lot, I require a lot of assistance to do my job as I didn't have any proper training and she also loves to discuss her life experiences with me. 
I don't mind a little of chit chat at the office but recently she started saying things like ""you have a really bad accent"" ""I don't understand what you're saying because of your accent"" or ""it's because where you're from I don't understand what you're saying""
Unfortunately this doesn't feel like feedback or constructive criticism, she doesn't tell me what I said wrong or how to fix it, she just says I speak wrong and continues with whatever next topic she'd like to discuss.
And this is driving me crazy, I have started to speak less and less around her and even away from her I have shut down from most social activities like parties or get togethers because I feel I sound stupid or uneducated or just bad. I know it's probably not the case but as she repeatedly says it... Well it's kinda getting to me.

I don't want to quit since I know this job is a good opportunity for me and might turn into something bigger with time but I also don't want to confront her about it since I've seen her be very vindictive against people she disagree with going as far as fire them under the excuse of ""lacking work performance"" even though they were some of the best employees this agency has ever had. 

So I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. I'm at a loss.

Any suggestions? "
10257,cclvle,CelesticRose,How do I function as a normal human being with mental illnesses?,"Ever since I was a kid I struggled with anxiety and panic attacks. I think it started getting unbearable in middle school, and I stopped being able to go to school consistently due to panic attacks. My mom didnt understand. Its not like I was getting bullied or anything. The mere act of getting out of bed, showering, brushing teeth, eating, and leaving the house were enough to make me have a panic attack. I dropped out of middle school and took online school. I tried high school, I dropped out again due to panic attacks. I homeschooled and online schooled, but my mother refused to help me and it became me teaching myself. Most recently I got my GED after moving out from my moms place and started going to college. It has been much more bearable since I can make my days short and chose my classes carefully so I don't get overwhelmed. I'm about to get my associates, mostly doing online classes and the *very* occasional class at the college. The biggest deterrent from going to college physically has been social anxiety, not being able to maintain personal hygeine, and never getting enough sleep. I never leave the house. I'm always trying to keep myself isolated or my panic attacks happen. I started working at a bank this week. I really love it there, everyone is so nice, and the pay is decent. But every day when I get home, I have a panic attack lasting upwards of hours. They're giving me full time hours during training, and I also have to have someone drive me there 45 minutes there and back every day. I dont have my drivers license, but I'm in the process. On top of that I'm taking a online college class right now, drivers ed (online), and need multiple hours a day just to calm my anxiety. I have no time for anything other than work, sleeping, and studying. I dont even get a full 8 hours of sleep since insomnia and panic keeps me up. dont want to be fired or forced to quit from the bank. I've had so many jobs now that I had to quit due to my anxiety, and I hate it. I don't know what to do. I have a therapist. I take my SSRI. I do breathing exercises. None of it helps. I cant see my therapist rn due to the hours work is giving me. I told them I needed less but they only gave me 8 hours less, and I had to take a sick day today because of panic attacks all of last night and this morning. I dont know what to do. Could benzos help me? I dont want to always be too scared to leave the house. Will I be able to get better? What's wrong with me? I just want to be normal."
13836,budjk7,krupenstein,I (32f) have knowledge that someone in my family (60+m) is a pedophile. Am I obligated to inform other family members who have kids?,"Backstory: My step-father (who came into my life when I was about 3) is a pedophile. He used to very discreetly brush up against me, look at me inappropriately, and once touched me through my clothes and then told me not to tell anyone. I also caught him looking at child pornography when I was maybe 8 or so.

I have recently confronted my mom about the whole thing, thinking she would divorce him, but the short of it is that she admits that she knows he is a pedophile (she even caught him with child porn when I was a child too) but doesn't believe that he ever intentionally molested me. My mother has decided not to leave him so I've essentially cut off contact with my mom. I was in therapy for a while and will probably have to go back to continue to deal with this.

At any rate, what I am concerned about is what kind of obligation I have to tell others (like my cousins) who have young girls about what he has done. I don't think he visits them, but that's not to say he never will in the future. I worry that they post pictures of their kids on Facebook and that he sees those. I feel like I should tell them, but honestly the whole thing is hard for me to deal with as it is, and I'm not sure I want to drag anyone else into the emotional hell of finding something like this out. I don't think he is a threat to anyone. I am not close with my cousins at all (they are actually my step-cousins; his blood nephews and nieces).

So, what do I do? Do I tell them, drag them into the pain and confusion and anger of knowing this about him? What kind of riff might that start in that family? Is it my moral obligation? Is it OK to just stay quiet? With summer coming, what about pictures of kids at the pool in swimsuits?

I'm sorry if this is stupid, I just really don't know what to do and I think about it a lot."

Then a couple of friends told me he had been shit talking me with his friends and saying a lot of other insensitive mean stuff, and that I should not be around him because he is actually a bad influence. He also lies and denies telling people things about me, but gets mad at me when I white lie. I know I can't stop him from shit talking me though.

I ended up sleeping with one of my coworkers and he’s much younger than me (21/m) and I just turned (33/f). I didn’t think much of it until last night my other coworker told me that his friend said he was still a virgin. I might have taken this guy’s virginity and didn’t know it. I don’t know how to feel about it. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Help!
820,dpilty,AnotherCollegekid151,How do I motivate myself to get out of bed?,"I feel like I have tried everything from excessively loud alarms on the other side of the room to complicated alarms that require math to snooze. Now I just sleep through every alarm, not ideal with college roomates. I've been a little better this semester making it to the gym early on some mornings but when it comes to class work I don't feel motivated to get up. This means I force myself to stay up late to get work done because I can't seem to work in the morning. Which makes me more tired and makes it harder to get up. I feel like I have been fighting with my sleep for years I don't know what else to do."
18614,b69vg0,YuriOnMeltedIce,Boyfriend talks over me constantly when he’s around his friends,"So I (19F) recently was asked to go to the Cayman Islands with my boyfriend (25M) and a bunch of his friends (41F) (45M) (30M)  for a nice vacation. And of course I decided to go with them because I really needed a break from work. So yesterday we went to catch our flight in Chicago which left at 6am and we got there around 9pm. They didn’t tell me the plans for what we were doing there or in the Islands at all, which was fine because I like to spontaneously plan things too. But what they didn’t tell me was that they were basically going bar hopping for 8 hours knowing that I can’t drink. The whole time they didn’t care and kept handing me drinks and jokingly saying ‘try this!’ I just had my headphones in and tried to ignore them to the best of my ability, but I was very tired which made me even more upset. But after 7 hours of loud and very drunk people, we were finally on our way to the airport.

I was excited because the trip was actually starting for me! I would be able to do things and have fun or so I thought. We finally get to the airport and I basically have to babysit all of them because they’re shitfaced, which wasn’t too hard. And we got on our flight and we’re finally here!

But the day after we got here my boyfriend started acting completely different, he won’t hold my hand and he talks over me nearly every time I start to talk. So I went outside and sat by the beach and he came over and yelled at me for not participating in conversations and wanted me to stay right next to him and watch all of them play a game of cards that I can’t be included in because it’s four players :,))) I am a very introverted person, and I only know my boyfriend and one other person that we’re with. So I went back and tried again to do as he wanted and be a part of the group. But then once I finally opened up and start talking to them, they all started talking over me shortly after I sat down! So I left again and I’m sitting in our room writing this right now, and I just don’t know what to do/if I’m being mean? This is my vacation too and I feel like they aren’t understanding of that.

TL;DR Boyfriend asked me on vacation, talks over me in a group setting and doesn’t involve me in plan making."

18256,b88ths,mizumonos,A girl I am planning to move in with next year apparently wants her sister and her one year old son to move in with us. Help?,"Basically, five of us are all pharmacy students and we have secured a house for second year. A girl, let's say Alice, told everyone else except me that her sister wants to move in with her son at the start of the year, because she is finishing her masters. 

I found this out from my close friend (aka the only one out of the four girls I actually talk to properly). She thinks it's a bad idea too, but she doesn't have the heart to tell her.

I guess Alice decided not to tell me because she knew I wouldn't agree. I also think she's known about it for a while but she deliberately waited until all our deposits were paid to tell us. 

I want to tell her why I think it's a bad idea but I don't want to look like a dick, you know? Am I being a dick for not wanting a complete stranger and her kid in the house?

What's the best way to approach this?

32673,85dhn6,incognitopresident,Trying to get into security due to it being easy to get into and pays acceptably. Parent isn't having it.,"I'm 25. Normally, the default response would be ""do what you want, you're a grown man"", but my mother enforces the ""my house my rules"" thing, leaving me no choice. I've been unemployed for almost 3 years, and jobs are turning me away left and right. Whenever I run out of money, I ask my father, but i'm never a fan of doing that since i'm pretty much being a leech. My mother insists on continuing applying to retail jobs(which like I said are turning me away) despite them not really getting me anywhere in life. She also likes to bring up there's a lot of danger on the job, but according to numerous sources, depending on where you go, there's next to no activity. I'm not physically capable of doing a trade, I don't really have any marketable skills, nor do I have any connections to get me anywhere.

So basically, my plan is to get part time in security, save up money, get the fuck out of this house, do full time at different areas, then figure it out from there. What can I do here, really? I'm sick of being broke and i'm sick of living with my family."

24086,99v94w,narcimp,Got fired from my job for a very embarrassing reason so I didn’t tell any of my coworkers but now there’s a rumor I got fired for something worse. Should I spill the beans to exonerate myself or just move on?,"I used to work at a very popular theme park in Southern California where the work environment is a lot like high school and people talk. As employee I got complimentary admission. One day I decided to visit with a friend and we tried out a lot of the alcohol offerings and became quite intoxicated. I didn’t realize how drunk I was because I did not think I drank that much but looking back I also didn’t eat anything all day due to cost. Long story short security kicks me and my friend out of the theme park and I get fired. I was so mortified about the entire thing that I decided I’d keep it to myself because I know just how my clique-y coworkers would react and so I just silently disappear. I thought I succeeded. Fast forward to about a month later and people have noticed I’m gone. Since I never told anyone why the circumstances of my departure they had to figure it out themselves.(my management team keeps reason of departures confidential) Around the time of my firing there was a scandal regarding $1,000 disappearing from the safe and an investigation was launched but no one was ever caught. Due to the timing of the  robbing and my firing it made sense to them that I’d done it and now enough people think I did it that it’s seen as a fact and I’m now an example of what happens when you steal from the company. My former colleagues thinking I stole from the company makes me feel so icky and really sad, I feel like all those bridges are burned. I feel like I’m in a lose-lose situation because in order to exonerate myself I have to spill about my recklessness. My mom says to let it go because chances are even if I told the truth they still wouldn’t believe me and that there’s probably no practical way of getting the message across to everyone who thinks I robbed. Bad press spreads faster and easier than good press I guess. What do you guys think? Should I try to exonerate myself or move on? Is it worth the effort?"

Well the idea of buying a house was planted in my brain, and it sounds so appealing to my strive for independence.  But my boyfriend was like a deer in headlights because he wants me to move in with him and I'm not ready for that.  It upsets him because I've lived with 2 boyfriends in the past.  The thing is that my live-ins both ended up being major major disasters and it has really affected me.  I don't want to be dependent on anybody right now, but my boyfriend is offended that I won't give him the same opportunity I gave the other two.

13443,bwd52u,Needhelp141,Need serious help,"Hey everyone,

I’m a guy in my late 20s really needing some advice. I’ve been on short term disability from work for a couple months due to crippling anxiety. I’ve had social anxiety since high school. I cannot leave the house without panicking. My job includes interacting with customers on the phone constantly. The last month or so on the job I couldn’t handle the anxiety anymore, the customers were so difficult to work with, highly stressful. I couldn’t do it.

While on disability leave, I did go to the doctor to try and get it under control. The medications did nothing and my doctor didn’t seem too helpful. I gave up on that route and I feel like I’m back to square one. 

I’m due back to work in a week and I honestly don’t think I can do it anymore. I’ve been looking for other job openings but nothing seems like a fit for someone with crippling anxiety. I’ve been trying to find something ‘behind the scenes’ where I can keep to myself and just do my job and go home. But there doesn’t seem to be anything like that. 

My mind is pretty much already made up about quitting my job. I’ll be okay for a couple months without a job with some money I have saved up. But I’m truly terrified I won’t be able to find a job that would be a good fit for me. I’m really worried I’m going to become homeless in a couple months. I live with my partner but they don’t make enough to sustain the both of us. The strain I’m putting on my SO isn’t helping my anxiety. 

What can I do? I feel so lost."

4333,d79g2c,Vorpal_Slade,Having trouble with living with other people at university,"Hi guys, thanks for taking the time to read this.

As the title says, I'm having a lot of trouble living with others at university during 2nd Year. 

I can deal with everyone's neuroticisms and bad habits for the most part, although fuck me some of them have a lot of them.

But what I can't deal with is that the housemates I like (my partner included) all have weekend jobs and I don't. I spent the best part of a year over the course of my two gap years working a 9-5 job before I came to university, and have just spent the summer after 1st Year back at the same place. I did this so I'd have enough time to study, not have to worry about money, and have more free time. I thought it would be a good thing. 

In reality, all it's left me doing is sitting on my ass on the weekends watching TV and reading. I have nowhere near enough work to fill the time, and for a number of personality clashes I can't stand the two flatmates who are also at home on the weekends. My hobbies are drawing, reading and playing board games, but these two sort of look down on stuff like that. 

I just flip between being really lonely and really overhwhelmed. My partner and the other to flatmates all wake up before me and leave for work, then get back around dinner time. In the evening everyone gets back at the same time, and I feel like it goes from 0 to 100 in terms of socialising, having spent a whole day by myself and now being forced to keep up conversation with five other people as we all try to make dinner around each other.

So currently my routine is either mind-numbingly dull or completely chaotic, and I hate it. It's really affecting my mental health and the idea that this will continue for the whole year (because none of them are about to quit their jobs anytime soon whatsoever) is just making me absolutely dread it. My partner's advice is to just relax, which doesn't help at all. Any advice would be great."
20722,auwf9u,OneLeggedWizard,My twin sister found my main Reddit account and now my parents think I'm a waste of space,"As you may have guessed by the title, this is an alt.

I've used Reddit for 3 years as a way to release stress. I'm 16 now and it's been immensely helpful. On my main account have have a fair chunk of karma, and I know it sounds stupid, but it means too much to me to just give that all up.

Anyways, the trouble started about a month ago. I had made a post on my main about my boyfriend and how my entire family doesn't know he exists. My twin sister, about a week later, asked me about my boyfriend by the fake name I used for him on Reddit. When I asked her about it, she said she got the wrong name and it wasn't a big deal. I didnt push the issue further.

Fast forward a week and I post a political opinion that my family disagrees on, about cops or guns or something (I can't remember, lol) We get in an argument 3 days later and she says ""At least I don't support _____!"" And storms off. At this point, I knew she had access to my Reddit account. I don't know how, but she did. 

So, no biggy, my twin sister and the person I trust most in the world knows a few more secrets about me. I wrote it off and just got more careful about stuff I posted. I would post stuff on the broken bone subreddit (I have a broken tibia) about what my PT said and she'd ask about it. Stuff like that.

Now, I'm screwed. Long story short, I got in a fight with my dad and posted a rant on some rant subreddit about my dad being a racist. Well suddenly my entire family and extended family has an image of that post. They're messaging me on Facebook trying to tell me I was wrong. The whole thing was screwed up, I deleted the post and apologized on Facebook. But I was pissed. She sent a screenshot of a rant post to everyone in my family.

It's been 2 weeks and the only people who are acting normal are my mom and my brother. My twin sister is avoiding me and my dad keeps making comments about ""When are you going to move out?"" Etc. I'm six-fucking-teen. I know to some people this doesn't seem like a big deal, but my dad doesn't joke around. He's actually sending my mom legal stuff about moving me out. I don't know what to do.

He got a girlfriend our senior year of high school and they are still together. But he just found out she is moving away. And I’m also leaving for the summer which is pretty untimely. He won’t have anyone all summer and even though I will text him it won’t be the same. I’m worried about him. He doesn’t eat. He doesn’t sleep. And last night he told me that he doesn’t have anything to live for. He said he doesn’t have any goals or motivation and that he only lives to make other people happy and not for himself. I don’t know what to say anymore. I want to help but I don’t know what I can do to make it better. I constantly reassure him but I feel like it’s useless. How can I be a better friend?

Last night my brother texted me (not too happy receiving the news through a text but whatevs) telling me that our best friend's eldest brother (late 20s/early 30s?) had passed away due to overdose. 

Both my mom and brother had asked me what they should do, I advised them to at least text C and her mom to show they care and offer their shoulder to cry on or help if they needed them. I don't live with my family due to school but they live closer to C  than I do. I had texted C telling her that she can call me if she needed to, I apologized for her loss, and I expressed two times that I was there for her and she didn't need to do this alone. I also asked if she needed me to come over. She replied with very short answers (as expected), she thanked me and said she didn't need me to come over. I also texted her mom saying something similar and that our family was there for them. She replied with a thank you. 
C has two older brothers that were also like brothers to me, both our moms are like second moms to the other. I think I'm still in shock and haven't totally realized that he's gone, but of course I feel terrible. 
I know that they need to do this by themselves and figure out funeral and burial details, but I want to help in the best way possible. I know giving them space is best right now, which is difficult for me. But what are some ways that I (or my family) can help?

14642,bqym2e,catsofcydonia,How do I [21F] take control of my life from a helicopter parent?,"Hi all, I hope this is the right place to ask this. I'm currently going into my last year of college and this has been a problem for awhile, but since I'm away from home it's not as obvious of a problem (until I come back like right now, during summer break). I'm pretty close with the parent of topic, and for years I've just let his ""helicoptering"" slide by. It was never too bad. But this past year it's been getting really out-of-hand with his age. Not to mention, I just turned 21 and I definitely should be able to make my own decisions. 

A bit of context, my dad has always been overprotective. It seems ever since his divorce, his trust has became pressed. He doesn't really trust anyone (due to my mom having cheating on them). He watched my high school grades with eagle eyes and when I told him that I didn't want him to be connected to my college grades, he couldn't understand. After some arguing, he finally let me have that bit of privacy. When I was learning to drive, he had a device set up in my car to ""grade"" my driving. If I sped, it'd alert me and also him on his phone. What I didn't know until later was that it also tracked everywhere I went. For I awhile, I'd just unplug it when I went some places and then I just eventually tossed it when he seemed to forget about it. Now, however, he's back to tracking me and my sister (who's now 18). 

This all started when my sister did a questionable thing late at night. This pressed his trust and he decided that he needed to be able to track her so she didn't do it again. Then when I was back home for winter break, he asked if he could put the app on my phone too so when I drove back to college, he wouldn't have to worry about me making it back safe. I just said ""sure"" not to make a big deal about it. I thought he'd only use it for that reason.

But then one day I was out with a friend. We were seeing a movie for a few hours. Once we got out, I saw my phone flooded with texts by my dad. He had tracked me and the phone told him that was in a sketchy part of town, *not* where I was at--the theaters. I told him I was alive and had my phone on silence. This ""event"" sort of drew the line for me when really, I probably should've said something a lot time ago. 

I'm an extremely anxious person and I tend to push things aside if I can. Which I definitely have with this. It's getting to the point where I have to do something though. This is effecting both me and my sister and I need some advice on the whole thing. I'm very close with my dad, so maybe I brought this upon myself. I don't want to ruin our relationship but this is becoming tiring to deal with. When I tell him I don't want to have lunch with him some days, he gets sad (I honestly think he's lonely). My sister isn't home a lot so he usually is on me about doing stuff together. I'm fine with the occasional lunch and movie, but not on every single day. I can't have a social life or do anything without him knowing about it. 

I'd also like to add that when I've tried to bring up this problem, just subtly, he quickly dismisses me. My dad is someone who always thinks he knows best. I know he's just trying to protect us, but there's an extent every parent should go to do that. What do you guys think?

The obvious solution would be to address this to my dad. I'm asking this more of as of *how* to talk about it? 

tl;dr: My dad is a helicopter parent of sorts and tracks me and my sister, even thought were both legally adults now. How do I tell him that I'd like some privacy without ruining a relationship?"

I log into it using the password I use for EVERYTHING. It works, I log into the page and there’s absolutely nothing. No pictures, friends or information. So I start to dig through my email, and the first email I got from Facebook was from August 17. (It is currently December 22 as I’m writing this).

31574,89luj4,megswasteland,Apartment living next year.. roommates are being tricky?,"Long story short, I'm a Freshmen in college and next Fall I'm moving into my sister's current apartment that she's had for two years. Since she is graduating from college this summer, I'm just taking the apartment from her. I invited my current roommate and two girls down the hall. Thing is, the apartment is three bedrooms two baths. There are four girls. Somehow the assumption was made that I'm sharing the master with my current roommate and the two other girls are getting their own room. 

Here's my dilemma. First, I found the apartment.. so shouldn't I get first pick in what room I want? I was just going to move right into the room my sister had since all her stuff is there and it's being handed to me to keep there. It's also the smallest room of the three, which I'm fine with. I don't really want a big space cuz my room at home was small anyway.  Also, three of the four girls are doing summer courses. They would be my roommate, me, and one of the other girls. So if I were to room in the master with my current roommate during the whole summer, the original room I was gonna move in to (my sisters) would be empty cuz the last girl wouldn't be there. To me it makes no sense to leave it open when all my stuff (bed, dresser, desk, etc) is still in there. Secondly, they all wanna switch rooms every year. That's a lot of switching?? I don't know if I should bring up the part of how I should get my own room since i found the apartment//invited them and that I don't want to give up my single room next year to then go room with another person. Of course in a year one person may move out, but i know they will make me promise to switch every year and shit. Thirdly, my current roommate wants her own room too and she was the first person I asked to room with me in the first place, before the other two girls. Thing is, the girls that said they are taking the single rooms wont budge on moving to the master. That brings me to my last point. The people my sister is rooming with currently in that apartment, said I can come over early (before summer classes start and before my technical lease of the apartment begins) to move in and stay there since they also expect me to just take my sister's room. To me it makes zero since for me to share a bedroom. 

What should I do? How should I bring it up? Or should I even bring it up? "
38044,7nu3wi,Sensible_Username,Lost my only friends and struggling with my new job,"New Years was my social death. I got way too drunk and high, said some things I shouldn’t have and got in a humiliating fight with the only friends that I have. I have since been disowned and shunned by them to the point of no return, which jeopardises essentially all of my other social connections (such as going out partying, relationships, girls etc). 

I furthermore started a new job at a place I really don’t fit in to and am struggling to make meaningful relations with my coworkers. 

I am feeling extremely outcast by many in my life at the moment and my social (now lack of) and working life are making me severely depressed.

23756,9b7bl5,MC2187,How do I deal with guilt over parents spoiling me?,"I'm the oldest kid in the family and I have two younger brothers. My father would tell me that due to his hard upbringing he told himself that he would give his kids everything he couldn't have growing up, those kids being my brother's and I. Since I was the first one born I had 5 years of being the single child and I guess that engrained in my mind that I could get whatever I wanted. So growing up I would always ask my dad my dad for a bunch of toys or video games. Keep in mind my parents make decent money as they both have two jobs. The guilt didnt hit me until my younger brother called me out on how much my parents have spent on me buying me what I have asked them for. He pointed out that they have spent about 3k on buying me guitars over the past 3 years, not even including everything else, how sometimes it seemed that I wasnt grateful for it. They dont just spend on me, they spend a lot on my brothers also. It doesn't help that my friends are always saying I'm ""lucky"", makes me feel extremely guilty. How do I deal with this guilt?"
28484,8m5z6a,Rushiee,In a weird transitional period of my life and I feel so lost.," So to start, I [20M] feel like I’m living in shades of gray. Me and my girlfriend split up recently. She was the first girl I’ve ever been serious with. She’s already seeing someone else, but that’s not really what I’m here to talk about. 

 Being with my friends doesn’t feel the same anymore. I feel as if I’ve grown into a very passionate person within the last year or two. I’m pretty much a cliche artsy kid. I create all types of art from music to visuals. 

 Now my friends want to participate in the music and we’ve worked in the past and have been pretty successful. However, lately I feel as if they lack passion and motivation. They don’t want to create nearly as bad as I do. They’re more in it for the whole “get rich and famous” thing whereas to me, it’s a form of therapy. 

 Besides that, I feel as if I’ve grown into a completely different person than I used to be relative to my friends. Everything feels so dull. I can’t talk about my breakup with them because that’s just not how our dynamic works. 
 
 I constantly ask myself what should I be doing right now. It’s currently 7:06 PM where I am. Just got home from hanging out with them. There’s still daylight. I want to do something productive, not sit in a room while each of us is being completely separate on our cellphones. 

 Since the breakup all I want is human connection. I can’t find it anywhere. 

 I think about my ex going out and having fun, doing her thing. She’s happy to be away from me. Yet I sit around all day not knowing how to be a person. I know part of this is my ego talking, and I know things will work out eventually. I just need some direction right now. 

 If you’ve taken the time to read this and respond, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I appreciate it more than you know.

10649,cag6q5,akslak,Rekindling love of science and challenges in teenage girl,"Hi. I’m a 17 y/o girl who used to love science. I’ve read articles about how girls have equal interest in STEM until around my age and I always thought it was societal pressure and that I would always love STEM. Unfortunately I was wrong.

When I was around 13 I read tons of books about physics and would watch Veritasium and the Physics Girl and all types of engineering and science content. I would seek out new things going on in the scientific world and would pursue opportunities in Stem through my school. About a year ago, though, I went to a summer program to learn physics and calculus. I hated it. I didn’t like the people in my dorm (though I had some friends, i didnt fully participate in the social scene there), my bulimia got out of control, and I fell far behind very quickly. I was very shy and ashamed of not understanding the material so I never asked for help. I left early and went home. I am still ashamed of this and regret my decision.

Then again, I took college physics online this past school year. I again had so much trouble. I stayed up nights and nights trying to figure out problems and scoring 33s on quizzes. I crashed my car because I was blanking out about the course. I stayed up studying the night before for a quiz that day. I ended up with a 96, but I hated physics after that.

With calculus, i took Ap calc at my school which went well generally. I enjoyed the class, though I didn’t excel like I usually do in math classes and performed poorly compared to a new girl in my class. I ended up with a 100 in the class and a 4 on the AP exam.

My experiences in the classes, especially physics, has played a role in making me hate science and math and my passion for it has vanished. I want to rekindle it and I want to fix the problems in my own psychology that made me so sensitive to the point where I can’t handle these challenges at all. Maybe I’m not cut out for stem, but I hope I am."
33246,83o6zy,Taylork64,So I have this weird habit. Can someone explain what it is if possible?,"So it's kind of hard to explain. A good example would be this.

I'm sitting at a desk, and I'm tapping my fingers on the desk. I count the amount of times each finger taps on the desk. If I have tapped my index finger 10 times, and my other fingers 5 times, I HAVE to tap my other fingers 5 more times each in order to be even with my index finger. 

It can also happen with other things besides tapping my finger, but that's the most common.

I know it sounds weird, but if I don't make it even, it will seriously bother me. Not extremely, but moderately. What is this? Is there even a name for it? I was thinking a very mild form of OCD or something similar. Does someone else experience this? Just curious

30721,8cht8j,foreveralonearchives,How do I be mature in arguments without being walked over?,"I love communication and confrontation. I always think it’s best to deal with things head on. When in a disagreement with someone I think the most important thing is understanding. I want to make sure I understand how the other person is feeling but also make sure they know how I’m feeling. I think it’s important to hear people out so no one is playing the blame game. Anyway, this usually leads me to apologize for however I have affected the other person. But I don’t want to apologize so much that it seems like I’m lying down and throwing my concerns out the door. If you apologize too much people think that you have done something wrong which if that’s the case, I apologize. But if you apologize too much people think you have done something wrong and they have done nothing wrong.

How do I have mature conversations in which I can look at my wrongs and apologize but still stand my ground about how I’m feeling?"

I recently moved across the country, in with my boyfriend. It was against my families wishes, but I do not have the best relationship with my mother. She has BPD which she refuses to medicate, nickle and we constantly did not get along. I love her, I just couldn't live with her anymore. 

My boyfriend a wonderful guy. We've been dating for about 2 years. He is in the army here in Louisiana.  I've been here for 4 months. Before I moved, I was a hairdresser and I didn't like it. I hated it actually. I haven't started working down here yet because I have this constant worry. My anxiety keeps getting in the way. I also don't want to go back to something I hate, nor do I have the money to go back to school. My boyfriend has hinted at getting married numerous times( I could go to school on the armys dime) but I'm only 21, he's 27. I'm not ready for it at all.

Every morning I wake up, I have no motivation. To clean, to work, to do anything. My boyfriend makes good money, but he stinks at saving. He wanted a brand new car, and it adds up to about 25% of our monthly bills is his car payment. We have about 1500 left after bills a month, but he just absolutely sucks with money. Buying stupid things (not needed) for the army here and there. Video games, has to have the best and the newest of everything. Every month we have to count our pennies the last week before he gets paid. I know me working will help, but I just can't pull myself to do it. He is currently paying my bills, (only a few store credit cars and my car insurance, roughly around 300 a month). He makes a little over 5000 a month. 

I guess what I'm asking here is.. basically advice on what to do. How to feel myself again. I used to be so motivated in high school, 4 years ago. I want to feel like myself again, get back to working out, working, even as much as dragging myself out of bed before noon as a first step.  Any little piece of advice would help. Thank you. 

TL;DR no motivation to do anything, can barely get out of bed. Struggling each month with bills."

He is painfully white and wants to look like an edgy badass. The worse thing he has ever done is smoked weed a few times and tried to get people to buy him cigs because he is scared to go into the store himself and buy them. I doubt that anyone would actually give him the tats but I do know that if no one will give him it he’ll try to do it himself with a needle and ink and that will just look even worse.
9458,cggnew,happyham155,I'm having trouble with my kitten using the litter pan,"Our kitten was found in our yard with no mama and we believe he was 4 weeks old at that time.  If that's accurate he is now 8 weeks old.  At 4 weeks we brought him inside and showed him the litter pan.  He did great for the first 7-10 days!   Then he started using various areas of the house instead of the litter pan.  We searched the web and learned that sometimes constipation and dehydration in young kittens can cause this problem.  So, we added water to his kitten food.  This worked to get him back to the litter pan for a few days.  Then he started using a different location in the house altogether.  So, we put a new litter pan there hoping that would help.  Now he has picked a third location and even with odor and repellent spray he is still using this spot.  However it is in our kitchen.

11169,c8341x,howyee,I was sexually abused my my cousin when I was younger. Should I tell my parents or does it not matter anymore?,"my cousin is one year younger than me, but at the age of 10 I was oblivious to how wrong the things she would do to me were. she would feel my breasts, show me her vagina (my memory is foggy but I believe she would also make me grope her), she would make me take pictures of her naked with her moms phone (she would then delete them), and she would do the same to me. she would do it even if I didn’t want to. 

not long after it happened I developed depression and anxiety. the abuse wasn’t the only reason I did, but it was a major part of it.

I kept it a secret for about 5 years until today when I had told both of my sisters. I didn’t realize how bad it was, even now, until I saw their reactions. I broke down in tears and they were supportive and were trying to cheer me up. 

a few months ago, I found out that my cousin was taking pictures of her neighbor and saying that she’ll do something to his girlfriend if he doesn’t leave her. she’s obviously not right in the head.

I haven’t told my parents yet because I’m scared that they’re just gonna brush it off. I don’t even think it matters anymore, yet here I am, crying, while I’m writing this.

What should I do?"
19932,ayye3c,Awaywitheverything,I (19) paid for sex and regret it with all my heart. Is redemption possible?,"So, about a year ago I made the biggest mistake of my life. While in Poland, I paid a woman to give me a massage and afterwards a 'happy ending' (this went further than I expected, and turned into full blown sex). I have since regretted it more than anything. It was wrong on every level. I don't remember seeing any obvious signs of trafficking, but the fact is that I will never truly know her situation. If she was in any way forced into this line of work against her own will, it basically makes me a rapist. You can't pay for consent anyway, and I should've realized that. I know I will never do anything like this ever again.

I have since learned more about the horrors of human trafficking. It sickens me that there's a risk that I have contributed to this. I was a complete fucking idiot and didn't consider it. Ultimately my stained morals really don't matter compared to the hurt I may have caused. But even if I'm lucky, and she wasn't there against her own will, it's still extremely fucked that I thought it was okay to pay for sexual intimacy. I know I must revaluate the way that I view women and sex. Women's bodies should not be treated as commodities to be bought and sold, there's no justifying that.

I'm not really sure what the point of this post was. I don't want any pity, I know I am a piece of shit. I'd rather not have a debate on the morality of buying sex either. I guess I just want some advice on how to become a less shitty person going forward. I want to be honest about my past with future partners, but before that I need to become a better person with healthier views on women."

We were dancing right up against each other and she put my hands on her ass and looked me in the eyes. At this point I was convinced that she was drunk to the point that she would hook up with any guy. So I decided not to make a move on her.

28731,8ky5tp,1026981337,[19/M]What do people even do?,"I wake up, go to school, go to work, play video games, and then sleep. Rinse and repeat. 
I can't imagine what people do besides that.

I hear about people going to beaches, clubs, movies, concerts, parks, etc. But none of that makes sense to me.

Beaches are littered with trash and animal feces. The ocean around it is probably severely polluted. I'm a bit too unattractive for talking to others with out a shirt on to not come off as creepy. I'm 5'8 and 19 years old. I have a beard which is near impossible to trim because it just grows back. I'm fat.

Clubs are annoying to me. I went into one once. People were standing around and talking with their friends or dancing. I'm not a fan of alcohol. Drinking it makes me feel retarded and sick. The concept of dancing is also retarded. Moving your body in response to audial stimuli in a semi-rhythmic fashion sounds like something a mental patient would do. It looks like that too in most cases. 

The idea of going to a theater is pretty trivial to me.
Pirating the movie a week or two later and watching it without the distraction of other people and with better audio quality provided by good headphones is a much better viewing experience. My couch is very comfortable.

Concerts are very much the same way for me. I'd rather listen to it without the distraction of a crowd. Much easier to do with headphones.

At a park you show up and you look at plants or something right? I understand a picnic or something with friends, but there's nothing to do really. It's not like I can play on the playground like I did when I was 5.

Nothing in the outside world intrigues me. Alot of the things that might catch my attention cost way too much money and time for me to consider it. I can't afford health insurance but I make too much for benefits.

I'm days away from graduating HS. I'd especially like a girlfriend. Someone to talk to and play video games with. Or watch a movie. Maybe go to the gym? Sex sounds fun although I don't have much of a drive.

I'm in an awkward position where I start college in the fall, but I'm already living on my own, and have been for a while. I kinda had to become an adult really quickly midway through high school and provide for myself. I've been successful but other people on their own are much older than me. Other high schoolers don't understand how or why I'm on my own, or how that effects my social life.

I'm certain I don't have an anxiety problem, it's just things don't really interest me. I'm not socially connected and I've never really had time to be up until now. Approaching my desire for social interaction or a girlfriend is really alien to me. I don't have much experience with it personally. Nobody has ever approached me and I've never approached anybody.

I listen to conversations at lunch, between customers at work, or here and there inbetween. They all seem to be without real substance. ""He said, she said"" type conversations which only carry meaning within their own little bubble. Nothing beyond that usually. I'm not sure how I'd interject or talk to a majority of people who only seem to have those kinds of conversations.

I only initiate conversation if I want something. ""Do you have a spare pencil?"" ""What time is it?"" ""Can I get an Oreo McFlurry?""

Likewise people only initiate conversation with me if they want something in similar fashion.

I'd like to be social and I'd like to have friends but I really don't know how.

TL;DR - I am having trouble understanding the setting of social interactions and how to initiate social interaction because it's largely illogical or alien to me."

I have a passion for art; drawing, painting, etc. and I've decided recently to put it to use and try to sell some of my creations. Problem is, my family expect me to give them art for free. Now normally I wouldn't have any issues, and at first I didn't. I drew a couple things for my little sister like any good big brother would, gave my mom a couple pieces as a present, etc.. I figured this would be enough to happily satisfy them since I don't HAVE to give them anything, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Except, now my family expect me to just create stuff for them (specifically my sister) whenever they ask. The thing is, this takes up time and resources (expensive art supplies) and forces me to essentially keep giving away stuff that I COULD be using to sell. I don't owe them infinite exploitation of a skill that I worked hard to hone just because they're related to me. I mean, it's my creations and my time and MY skill, *I* should be able to choose what to do with it?? So this has all built up into my sister throwing tantrums over me not making her MORE AND MORE stuff, and my parents saying that *I* am the one being selfish by not complying.

&amp;#x200B;

It's so frustrating because its not like they politely asked and then I declined and it stayed at that. They're harassing me about it, saying that I have to, blah blah blah... punishing me (I'm 16 so they can still do that to me) for ""not being nice"" by not just giving in, and trying to guilt trip me by saying ""is it really that hard?"". I mean, that kind of devalues all of the time and work I put into developing my abilities, it's not like I just learned this overnight. And... it's not like I PROMISED anyone anything either, so it's not like I'm being a dick by not doing something I said I would. I CLEARLY stated that I was not going to do any more after the last one.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I even do in this situation? Do I honestly owe them this stuff because they're family? How do I explain how upsetting this is??

There's this girl who I met in 5th grade when I was like 10; we were instant best friends and always hung out. In middle school we would have sleepovers all of the time. Anyway when we were about 12 years old, I realized I was gay and had a huge crush on my best friend. I realized I had always had a crush on her, and this scared me because I was always told growing up that being gay was a horrible sin. So I was mortified if I told her, or anyone that I would be hated. Looking back when we were young teens,14 years old she might have had a thing for me too. We cuddled a lot, she would put her feet in my lap, and we would sometimes flirt lol. But I could never tell if she actually was in to me. and being an awkward 14 year old, I didn't know what to do. In high school we drifted apart, and didn't talk as much. Flash forward to now, I always have wondered did I miss my shot? We're still friends on social media, and she always likes my posts and will comment on instagram. But we haven't really messaged or talked in years. Do you think I should message her out of the blue?

15694,blx502,CodeEnforcement,Dad doesn't want My (19M) GF(20F) and I to share hotel room on family vacation.,"A little background, my GF and I have been dating for around 8 months now. We both have met/spent a good amount of time around each-others parents. Both my mom and dad really like her. This summer, we are going on a family vacation to Florida for Disney World. My GF really loves Disney world, and naturally, I wanted to bring her along with us. 

Both my GF and I agreed that we would pay for our flight, tickets to Disney, and hotel room (so everything would come from our pockets).

My parents are both completely down with this.  
Here's the problem...

My dad doesn't want us to share a hotel room.

He called me today saying he was going to book the flight and the hotel, but he had the condition that boys would sleep with boys (me and my dad), and girls with girls (my mom, two sisters, and girlfriend).

Remember, me and my girlfriend are both over the age of 18, are going to pay for our own room, and are not irresponsible people.

I understand the mind of the parent, and how it may be kind of weird to get used to (the idea of my GF and I sleeping together).

However, both parents know that we are sexually active, and only care that we use protection. So that doesn't make sense to get upset about.

I am quite frustrated about this because he is in no position to budge on this, and is ""putting his foot down"".

What makes me mad and want to push back is that he isn't interested in having an ""open"" conversation (one that would consider my view on the matter).

How should I handle this in an appropriate and respectful matter? Because this seems a little unnecessary IMO."

32819,84ydat,tialygo,Picking between two jobs,"Hi all,

I graduated from college with my MS in Dec 2016, and since then have been working at a small start up (25 minutes from my house) as an Associate Scientist. I make $78,000 per year, salaried, with a 7.5% annual bonus. 

I started having some trouble with my boss’ management style in October, and so started looking for a new job. In January, we were put on furlough every Friday and our pay was reduced 20%. This turbo charged my search. The company said once the venture funding was acquired, as a retention bonus, we would be reimbursed the 20% of our furloughed salary, and our bonus would be paid out. 

I was offered a contract position at a very large company as a Scientist at $45/hour ($93,600 a year) for 6 months. I was concerned about it being a contract position, but the recruiter spoke to the hiring manager, and she told me that they are definitely looking to add someone to the team permanently if the contract goes well. Unfortunately it is 1 hour away (by train).

I just found out that my current company is expecting funding to come in next week. This would mean that if I stayed, I could collect the back pay and my bonus, so maybe around $10k pretax. But if I stay at my current position, I would still want to find a new job, because of my issues with my boss. However I would have the luxury of looking for a new job with the security of a full time permanent position, albeit with the stress of continuing to work with my boss.

If I take the new job, I get a pay increase, a better title, and the opportunity to join a larger company with a great reputation. Their salaried employees get great benefits, such as a pension plan and better health insurance than what I currently have. However the biggest downside is I could be looking for a new job again in 6 months.

Should I take the risk of the new job, or keep my old job and keep looking? I am married with a mortgage, so I’m not too footloose and fancy free unfortunately. But my husband makes plenty and he’s very stable in his current position, so we could be fine on one income for a few months.

I am an anxious person, and both options make me uncomfortable. I’d just like some other perspectives. Thanks!!"

Something like this happens about every other day, and to make it worse I always feel like I’m depressed and have severe anxiety and I even went to the school counselor at one point for it and she recommended that I go to get a diagnosis/start therapy. So I tell all this to my mom and she starts telling me to stop trying to get attention and that I’m fine. About a week ago I had a cutting relapse and I don’t want to tell her because I know I’m just going to get yelled at for it again. So if anyone knows how I can get help without her knowing or at least get away for a little bit then that would really help, thanks!

If something could be causing me to hallucinate, I would like to get it fixed. I know there are things that can do that, I just don’t know where to start. Have an electrician come check the wiring? Buy a gas detector? (But we can smell the gas..) 

Yesterday was my first day in the house, and I heard someone knock on the front door. I was napping and it woke me up a little, but I went back to sleep, because it didn’t wake me all the way up... I know, that’s rude. Then I heard two loud, heavy knocks on the bedroom door. Of course, no one was there. 

Today, I heard footsteps, someone shushing the baby while I was in the bathroom, one of the doors locked itself, and I saw my dog go behind a mirror— but when I got up to pull her out (as I didn’t want her to poop back there) I tripped over her. She was never anywhere near it.

Now this guy was literally my best friend and we had a great relationship but he wasn't the same religion as me so my parents did not approve. 

The guilt of disappointing my parents (they literally called me a disappointment) and losing someone I loved deeply really weighed on me.  The general advice I got from everyone around me was 'invest that energy back into your studies!! :)))' and I did that which led me to burn out. 

Studying was a great distraction but now I have no motivation to do anything, I cry multiple times a day, I feel so alone it hurts, I miss him so much. I feel like I'm going crazy and I no longer feel like myself-- which is scary because i was always so sure about who I am. It's been 8 months, am I dumb for letting a breakup make me feel this way?

3701,dadstt,daveydat1,Girlfriend is working for an autistic dentist who is being manipulated by another employees entire family,"Sorry in advance if this is rambly/not the right sub but we're really looking for advice on what to do.

The background is my girlfriend has started working at a dentists office as a receptionist. The man has autism but is very good at his job and extremely friendly and kind, especially with money. The man is in his 60's and has a mother with dementia in her 90's who he's paying a lot of money for the care she needs to be kept at home and out of a care home. 

The main carer for his mother is a woman who form what I've heard seems to be milking the man for all he has. Things like demanding higher pay for herself or she'll drop everything and leave. Demanding to be paid off the books. Demanding to get allowances for lunch, her car being serviced and her hair to be done. Most of this is what my GF has relayed to me via his panicked ramblings in work. Over all this aspect seems to stress him out the least overall as he seems to just go with it.

The main issue is the carers daughters are both working in the reception along with my girlfriend and this is where it gets particularly dodgy. One of them is 20 and has been working there part time since she was 16. Completely on the books, pays tax no problem there, except for the fact that she works for a fraction of the hours my GF works and gets the same per week. Like, literally she works maybe 10 hours a week and is taking home the same as if she was working 40. But whatever she's been there longer than my GF so no alarm bells go off there and my GF doesn't mind about other peoples pay etc.

The sister on the other hand was put through college to be a dental hygienist by the dentist. I'm not sure of the specifics around this but at first myself and my GF put it off as family friends and he had the money to do it. However she now refuses to work there saying it's too messy and if she was seen working there her hygienist title could be revoked? (not sure of the specifics of that either but it's something along those lines). But the girl still is being paid by the dentist the same as my GF who is working fulltime hours.

So we've kinda known this for the past few months and put it down to the fact that because the dentist and this family have been so intertwined for so long because of his mothers illness and them working at the office they're like family. However recently it's gotten a little sinister and we're beginning to suspect that maybe they're taking advantage of the man.

Both the dentist and my GF live in the same town, so naturally some mornings when it's raining the dentist would offer a ride into work. He has done the same for the two girls and their mother every morning for the past few years even with them living in separate areas and it taking close to an hour to collect all of them each morning. Again we put this down to family friends etc. But since he started doing it for my GF every now and again the entire mood of the office has shifted. 

Texts that my GF has been shown like ""Why are you bringing her to work"" and ""Stop letting her in your car"" have sprung up and even when both the dentist and my Gf have gone to the bank during the day the dentist has gotten increasingly aggressive calls from one or both of the girls saying ""you better not have brought her for lunch"" (which he does for them daily, my GF tends to avoid it as she doesn't want to take advantage).

The thing that made me write this post though is the most recent set of text messages the dentist got from the older sister (the one that doesn't even work at the office but is still being paid fulltime hours off the books, so basically no tax). It said something along the lines of ""don't you lie to us we know you bought GF (insert beauty product here) We have people watching you don't think you can lie to us don't ever do that again"".

(The beauty product was something my GF bought for herself and posted to her instagram story just so you know).

The dentist has been increasingly more and more distressed by the whole situation and has been telling my GF everything that been said by both the sisters and the mother in relation to what he can and can't do. They wont let him work Wednesday afternoons because they need a lift to wherever. Their mother is constantly threatening to leave his mother at the drop of a hat if he doesn't pay her more or doesn't give her and the daughters the extra allowances like getting hair done and the same pay as my GF.

TL;DR My GF works for a dentist with autism. The dentists mother has dementia and is in her 90's and her carer is threatening to leave if  her and her daughters who work at the dentists dental office doesn't get constant pay increases outrageous perks and they have the dentist paranoid and extremely distressed on a daily basis. One daughter refuses to work there at all and is demanding fulltime pay (off the books) and the other works very few hours and is doing the same. This has been going on for years.

Any and all advice for my GF is greatly appreciated!"

Every day we talk to each other, even if it is just exchanging some dumb jokes for five minutes, and obviously, I like her a lot. But one day, we got into a deep conversation and she started talking about her personal life, and she told me that next year she's going to move to another town. And I freaked out. I'm very shy, and most of my time I spend at home alone, but I felt like I needed to do something about it. So, when we hit one month talking to each other, I suggested that we should go and actually meet. I was waiting for a no, I got a no. I got kinda sad, but that's life. So, now it's going to be two months, and I asked again. Full agenda. Sunday she was going to play RPG, and she has a lot of things to do since she works as an editor in her free time and also has to worry about school. And I don't know what I can do. Currently, my weekend is just looking locking myself in my bedroom and listening to music, watching something, working or just alone. I'm getting really bored. I don't know if we should meet, I don't know if she actually wants to meet, I don't know anything. I just want to get out of this boredom, but it seems like I can't. I'm giving up on going out with her, and really, I don't even care anymore. She's too good for me anyways. We did two calls and played together, watched some dumb thing that I found and it was great. But these last few days, it's like she started to avoid me and I don't know if I should keep this friendship on or jump off. Please, someone, help me to do something about this or just say something that I can do and get out of this boredom that grows in me. Thanks.

edit: I'm taking a break from her. Will stop talking to her for some time and try to remember myself who I am and get my shit together. A huge thank you to everyone who tried to help me. Papa bless."

I legit just use water. I don’t use lotion or anything. And basically my main question is, where do I shave? Like I know I’m supposed to shave the big part of your vagina, where most of the hair grows, but what about the area where you like pee and stuff? I have hair there. Is that normal? Am I supposed to shave that? K honestly I sound really gross, but I don’t know who to ask. I have a really awkward family who are very modest and don’t talk about these things. My mom also never told me about sex, and she never explained periods. She just showed me how to use a pad and gave me a box. She assumed I learned everything at school or from friends, but I’d rather learn from the woman who gave birth to me... it’s easier to understand when she’s there.

30106,8ei0o6,MyBlanketIsSoSoft,Should I move cities for Lifestyle/Dating?,"Hi all,

24F, I’m a soon to be doctor in Australia and I’m hoping to get some help/insight on my dilemma.

I’m currently finishing up my studies in a country town, 5 hours away from any major city. In 2 or so weeks we have to put in applications on where we want to work for the next two years.

Currently I’m loving the town I live in but there are some definite drawbacks. 

Pro’s:
- Working here will be excellent (in terms of support, bosses and staff)
- Opportunity to work in Sydney for a rotation of 10 weeks
- Living costs are lower (rent will likely be 1/2 that of Sydney)

Con’s:
- Limited food options/restaurants - especially in terms of international food (I love my Korean food!)
- Virtually 0 dating potential here. I’m of non-Caucasian descent and I would like to find someone with a similar/multicultural background but this town is very white and Catholic
- Basically lifestyle here is limited in terms of drinking/bars, eating out, food festivals, markets, etc

Moving to Sydney is my other option, somewhere I’ve lived for 5 or so years. I love Sydney as well, so it’s a hard choice for me.

Pro’s: 
- Food!
- Much more international/multicultural mix of people (for dating and friendship - I find it a lot easier to really ‘click’ with non-Caucasians)
- More things to do outside of work

Con’s:
- Work has the potential to be terrible - some people love it and some hate it, limited support, might have bad bosses
- Might be stationed very far from where I’d like to be
- Commuting to work + expenses
- Lifestyle and rent will be more expensive 


I don’t have any family in either town/city and no friends I’d base my decision on either way.

I’ve never dated anyone in my life and if I stay in this town, that fact might remain the same when I’m 26-27 years old.

I was wondering if anyone has any insight on moving cities just for the lifestyle/dating factor and whether they’re happy with their decision, regret it, etc. Would love to hear your stories and advice.

Thanks in advanced!"
28732,8kxzmb,GoldberryBlue,Blurted out a severe childhood trauma during a fit of drunken rage,"I've always had an issue with alcohol, and I knew it was because of stuff I repressed and suppressed from my childhood. My father and his brother (my uncle) molested me, and it has been something I've always tried to forget. I've pushed people away and sabotaged relationships bc I always felt there was this part of me I had to hide. I felt ashamed and used alcohol as early as 13 to try to numb that part of me. 

Last week, my mom visited, and we went out for drinks. I wanted my bf to meet up with us, but we had had an argument a day before her arrival, so I knew he wouldn't want to see me for a while. I got in a huge argument with my mom bc she laughed when I told her one of my dream jobs that I had seriously thought about pursuing. Somehow I blurted out that I was molested, and it was her fault bc she left me alone with them. I feel awful for saying that to her. I don't blame her for it. The whole night was a nightmare, and I won't get into all the details, but it was all my fault. I ended up calling my bf and screaming at him on the phone about not meeting me to see my mom while she was in town, and I ended up telling him about my big secret. I feel like a fucking idiot. He said the next time I went drank and lost control like that, he'd break up with me. The day or so after it happened, he basically said ""a lot is done"" meaning, I'm guessing, the relationship is over. We were supposed to meet a few days ago to ""talk"", but I'm pretty sure that means he wanted to come over and re-explain why we shouldn't be together. Idk, but I'm not going to try to fight it anymore. I wish I had told him under different circumstances bc I think it would've solved a lot of issues in our relationship - being able to feel completely open and honest with him, not feeling like I was always hiding something shameful.

I feel free. A secret I've held onto for about 2 decades is finally out. Part of me feels exposed, but mostly I feel like I'm not a prisoner in my head anymore. I told my closest girl friend about it, and she told me that her mom went through the same thing, and she described having those same feelings of shame. It sucks that she lives several states away from me though bc I could really use her support right now besides just facetime and messaging. I could really use a hug. Not bc I'm sad or scared or anything bad. I don't know how to describe it yet."

3987,d8w8bw,thyme2headout,Should I tell my wife about my plan to kill myself in two years after life insurance kicks in?,Not looking for a savior or to make people sad just wondering if I should broach the subject with my wife. This is marriage number 3 and I am just not getting it. I’m a terrible husband. She tells me all the time how unhappy she is but she’s stuck with me. I make all the money and I bought the house we live in. She can’t afford it without me but I’m tired of feeling like I have a hostage. So I want to get a life insurance policy and wait for the suicide clause to end after the first two years. I want to ask her if she can just hang on for two more years I’ll be gone and she will have everything she needs to have a place to live and be financially okay for a few years. I have schizophrenia and PTSD from my child hood and Iraq so I’m miserable every single day. I don’t really want to be alive anymore I’m just kind of waking up with the attitude of “oh great I didn’t die last night.” Then I meander through my day just wishing I wasn’t in pain anymore. This causes a lot of strain on my relationships with my son and my wife. I would get enough for him to go to college and for her to be able to comfortably pay off the house. Should I say something or should I just do it without letting her know anything? I feel like it would be better not to include her so she doesn’t have to suffer with the information for the next two years.

4694,d5djau,greencloudpol,my sociopath best friend is literally copying my life,"So i’ve noticed and been thinking about this for a while, I first met her last winter, so not even a year ago but we became close friends really fast. And already from the beginning i noticed how she started copying me but i didn’t really mind it that much, she changed her style from really girly to edgy/ emo like me. 

Bought the same clothes as me, started  using the same jewelry that literally no one else wore. Then i colored my hair pink, and she colored her hair pink yet she had the same hair color before her entire life. She started the same volleyball classes as me without telling me, and when we first met she didn’t even like it. She used to listen to ariana grande etc, and didn’t like hip hop but now the only thing she listens to is lil peep etc. I got a few new piercings, she got the exact same ones.

 When i told her I lost my virginity she literally went the same day and lost hers with a random guy. Also she never wore beanies and when i started wearing them recently she now also wears them 24/7, and during winter i asked her why she didn’t wear one since it was cold and back then she said it was lame and she didn’t fit in it. Also now i colored my hair blue and she colored her hair again, blue. 

This is starting to annoy me and the more I think about it even the more pissed off I get. It’s  so many more things she is copying me about since she is literally copying my entire life, i want to be myself and i want to be recognized as no one but me but since she looks the same as me we are literally 2 twins walking around. And whenever she copied me  i change something about me but then she changes that too so we are always the same. I’ve told my friend stuff like, oh you’re doing that too now? etc, different hints but she doesn’t care. Also something worth knowing is  that my friend is a sociopath and is incapable of feeling empathy and love,  but that’s a whole other story. What do I do, this is annoying me on so many levels right now... Thank you if you read all this."
29952,8ez5px,InimaFranta,Moving out but still need my parents for financial help,"So long story short I have no relationship and no connection to my family. My parents and I never have conversations, I don't know much about their lives and they don't know much about mine. The only thing tying me to my house is the fact that my dog is here and I financed a new car and the loan is in my father's name and so is the insurance because I am only 21 and the insurance would be $4000+ per year on my own but its only $2000 per year now. My girlfriend and her mom have told me countless times that I can move into their house. Now, I want to do this, I want it so bad but my questions is this;

How do I tell them I am moving out without Jeopardizing the financial help they are giving me with insurance?

My phone is also on their plan. Saying I live on my own would help me apply for financial aid to pay for my last semester of college but I am still faced with the dilemma on how to tell them without them cancelling my insurance plan.

20371,awrter,denkle23,Should I report a classmate for shaking a baby?,"I am a high school student and my best friend’s ex girlfriend works childcare for a local gym. She regularly makes posts on instagram where she shares  videos of the infants and toddlers that she watches at the gym. Today she posted a video which showed her shaking a kid (probably 6-9 months old) pretty violently. She seemed to think it was funny because the baby made gurgling sounds while she was shaking it. The baby was on her lap with it’s head hanging off so it wasn’t supported. The baby went quiet and seemed visibly dazed with its head tilted back when she stopped. 

I tried to confront her in two ways: First I commented on the post saying “You shouldn’t shake babies like that, especially without supporting their heads! You could give them a concussion without meaning to”
She replied saying “Thanks for your concern, as this is my profession I keep that in mind. I made sure her head was supported, and jumping babies up and down stimulates them and encourages development!”
Then I texted her and said “hey i'm really concerned about your asmr video where you're bouncing the baby. she went quiet at the end and thats what happens when they get shaken. you should really be careful about doing that.” 
It’s been six hours since I texted her and she still hasn’t replied. 

I have the contact information for her boss, but I’m not sure if I should call and tell them what she posted. I’m worried that she’s going to be fired and then blame me for it and possibly fight with me at school because of it, but I’m also worried that she might hurt a kid withhout meaning to.

15007,bp4i0s,lyssaly,Should I cut my “friend” out of my life?,"I have a friend who I went to college with who was from my hometown, lets call her M. M and I lived together senior year of college (last fall/this spring) with 2 other girls. Over the course of the year, M showed me that not only was she a much worse person than I thought she was, but she also had been talking shit about me to our other roommates. Important to note here that she had been talking shit to me about said roommates our whole junior year (they lived together then, I replaced their fourth the second year). I was a dumbass who thought M just didn’t like them and didn’t realize she was just that type of person. The whole of senior year was basically M bullying me by trying to control me, constantly correcting me, treating me like I was stupid, and randomly accusing me of things like lying and talking behind her back (probably due to her own guilty conscience). 

Here’s my issue. M knows A LOT about me, including the fact that I am bisexual and not out to my family. M also lives in my very small home county, and is well liked because she’s great at putting up a front with acquaintances. I’m afraid that if she’s feeling petty and vindictive enough, she’ll lash out at me in some way. I’ve seen her do it before, create awful situations in which she is the victim. 

If I were to block M online and cut her off completely, I would be getting peace of mind as well as a little vindication. If I don’t, she’ll constantly contact me and try to talk to me like we’re friends, which is shitty because every time she’s around I can feel myself get extremely anxious, mad, and feel like I can’t tell M no or be upset with her without being punished in some way. What should I do?"
38475,7mmhk2,amypw12,Was I cutting in line?,"So I’m in a store with 3 registers, 3 cashiers. Note that the right register is unavailable as the cashier is clearly sorting something out with a customer. Leaving the left and the middle ones.

When I’m ready to pay, I go up to the line for the left register where there are 2 customers in front of me, with my 5 year-old brother. The person in front of us ends up putting back his things and leaving the store because the guy in front of him was taking a while.

At this point, there is a woman with her teenage son in the middle line behind two customers. Because the guy who we are now behind seems to be taking a long time, another two people start lining up behind this woman. The guy in front of me is finally done, and at this point the woman w/ her son is now only behind one customer.

Here’s where I get confused and embarrassed: We walk up to the now open left register because it’s where we’ve been lined up, right? As soon as I do this the woman with the son next to us gets extremely mad and shouts in this tiny store, “Excuse me? Do you want to get in the line?!” In her most annoyed, bitchy voice. Widened eyes and everything. 

Embarrassed and not wanting to anger this woman even more... I end up getting flustered, mutter an “I’m sorry”, and we move to the back of the middle line. Which apparently was now a single line to multiple registers.

Here I am confused because when I lined up, there were TWO SEPERATE LINES FOR THE TWO REGISTERS. There was also no other indication of a single line/multiple register situation as this woman was lined up right behind the customer in front of her. Was I supposed to give up my spot because after a while because this woman decided there was now a single line behind her for the two registers? Did I cut in line??????

I also don’t understand why people get THIS worked up over this since it’s not like we were being rude on purpose? It’s not like we completely disregarded a whole line of people and pushed into the line in front of her? 

I would’ve been perfectly happy to go to the back of the line, if it really was a single line all that time, since it would’ve been an honest mistake and I was just being dumb. Apparently the girl at the end of the middle line thought this too since she ended up letting me and my brother go in front of her saying, “Hey it’s okay you guys can go in front of me” with a really kind smile.


Did I cut in line? If so, I accept my mistake. If not and the woman was in the wrong in this situation, how do I become more assertive and not freeze in a situation like this? D:

3325,dcarqf,ulyysse,I just probably weirded out my favorite teacher with what I did to him. I feel extremely guilty,"So there’s this one teacher I really care for deeply , and I wrote him a mail (for the second time) to thank him for being my teacher. 

In my first email , that was 4 months ago, I sent him a digital drawing I made for him along with  the text “Thank you for being my teacher this year” written in the description.  He really made an impact on my life , and I really felt like thanking him for it. 

The next day or so, he came to me in person , searching me in the halls, and told me that he read my message and was very touched by it. I was very glad and thanked him for that.  I was very touched by what he told me, too. He then spoke with a teacher of mine ( I was entering class in that moment) and pointed to me and they both started smiling. 

I keep having him on my mind. He means a lot to me (to be honest, I care for him more than my parents, that are quite abusive ) , but not in a romantic kind of way ,under any means. I just.. think of him really often and admire him as a person , generally.

In the second mail, which I sent on the 26th of September (6 days ago) , this is what I wrote (keep in mind, I don’t have him as a teacher this year) :

«  For Mr . ***** ,

I sincerely am not used to writing proper emails.

This can seem weird to receive a mail from my part, especially since it’s for the second time, too, and I doubt terribly that this is not strange....

However, I wanted to write you this in my first email but I wasn’t brave enough to do so, and , now, I still think of thanking you because of it , yet still, I am very scared of your reaction , and I’m trying to write this in the best way possible....

I admire you a lot as a teacher , yet you also intimidate me in reason of that, and I still keep thinking of sending you this message because I would panic way too much, and my words would be very incomprehensible due to my fault , if I would try telling you this in person .

You are a teacher that inspires me more than any other individual, as you are someone very unique , I believe , which makes you a very memorable teacher..

Having the chance of being this happy and invested in class made me more grateful than ever , and you made me passionate about a subject without me realizing. Thank you.

With my greetings and thanks,

-Insert my name-

(Thanks again...!) »

....Yeah. I’m really embarrassed , now...

Before knowing that he read it (until, like, 20 minutes ago) I did get to talk to and greet him a couple of times , and  he did not seem weirded out at all with me. Actually, he did put slightly more effort into greeting me ( smiling , raising up his intonation a little and bowing his head  ) than others. He acted totally normal to me, so I really don’t know what to say.

Until now , after leaving music class ,  I went up to him after saying ‘Hello’ to ask him for something. This is how the conversation went like : 

“Hello Mr. ** ..!” 
“Hello there !”
“ Um, Sir, I was wondering .. did you...by any chance, read a message that I sent to you?”
“ Ah..yes , I read it , but I didn’t reply because I did not know what to say...I’m not sure what you expect from me to reply to it.”
“ Oh, no , it’s nothing at all ! I’m just extremely sorry !”
“ Sorry for what ? “
“ I was just really scared and felt really bad for what I have written , I’m really sorry ! “
“ You don’t have to bow like that (he made a joke that I bow like the Japanese and kept saying “Sumimasen! Sumimasen!” haha ) 
There’s nothing to be sorry for . There’s nothing to be scared for. Don’t worry about it. “ 
...And so he headed to his class.

Although the conversation may have been quite relieving in some way for me (he didn’t yell at me or anything)  , I feel extremely bad. Maybe he feels weirded out by me and only tried to be nice to me this time but he actually hates me. It’s my fault. Maybe.. I don’t know. I wonder what he thinks now.. he must be thinking I’m really strange. 

I keep thinking about this , and I’m not sure what to do or say.. 

I would really appreciate your help . I’m not sure  if it’s my fault ,  what I should do, if I creeped him out.. I just don’t know what to do. I’m sorry."

It's hard to talk to my parents because my mom and I are close but she does not really ""get"" me truly. But I know whenever I try to vent to her she gets stressed out herself and being very empathetic, I get stressed out that she's stressed and it's an overall burden on me because it causes me more emotional distress overall, even though she has good intentions. I don't know if I even have a question, if anyone wants to say anything about this, feel free to do so."

21126,at3cka,Slimable,Always Seeking Approval of Parents,"So I’m a freshmen in college, but I go to school near me so I live at home, and I always find myself needing my parents approval to feel good about a decision, especially when It comes to money, I’m pretty minimalist so I don’t spend money unless I really want things, I never eat out on my own dime and never stop to get snacks or coffee. But recently I had $1,000 in my checking with 100 in cash stored away and I’ve always wanted to get into photography, but never had enough financial security to buy a camera and still have money left for gas, and possible emergencies. But I bought a camera for $450 and I feel as though my father specifically isn’t very on board with the idea of me spending my money.  And this feeling really digs at me, makes me think is this a smart decision for the future and could this money go to something more essential. I don’t really have a solution to deal with this other then when I confront them about the prospect of a purchase and they are on board. Any advice is helpful, thanks and have a bless day! "

He’s an old friend/acquaintance who lives out of state, and he’s getting married in four hours. Should I send a text saying I can’t make it and wishing him well, or just not say anything?"
17473,bcnaz4,UsedJelly,"I am having multiple problems at once and I don't know how to deal with it. (Family/Home, School, Social...)"," I am overwhelmed and want to scream on top of a mountain.

For one, I am extremely unhappy at home. I can't remember a time when I actually felt comfortable living here(home). I don't give a damn about my mother's SO, and he most likely doesn't give a damn a about me or my brother. It's so fucking awkward. When I try to initiate conversation, he responds with a conversation killer, so I gave up with everything. It's frustrating, because he talks a ton more with my cousins and other family members. It's bullshit to me, but I can't change him. I understand that. I just hate living under the same roof as him. I don't appreciate him talking about me or my brother to my little (half) sister saying that I am lazy while he throws the dishes in the sink complaining that we don't wash or clean around here. It's like if I do *one* thing wrong, the world has fucking exploded. He fails to communicate and blames us. I hate how my mother is messenger. My brother and I have talked to her about it, and she tries her best to not take sides, but really? Why can't we all talk to one another? She keeps saying that ""we're all adults here and have work/school...we will all do things to make someone unhappy or not to their standards,"" but this is unnecessary. The other day, I forgot to take out my bedsheets from the dryer, and he took it out and threw it on a tote. He failed to tell me. It's not a big deal, but it's ridiculous how different the situation would be if I did that to him. I've never thrown his stuff like that. I try to find a basket at least and talk about it. I hate pretending like I care. It's not me. I don't want to be nice to someone who doesn't care about me. He's the biggest hypocrite I've met, and we're all hypocrites in this world!

On another note, I'm 19 and am terrible at ""adulting."" I can't drive. I'm not comparing myself to others that much, but at 19, I don't feel free. I should be driving and doing a little more than I am now. I honestly am home most of the day if I am not at school. I don't have friends IRL. I talk to people online. I'm working on my social anxiety, but in the mean time, I am lonely and stressed. I'm talking to a clinician with the psychological services at school, and it seems like she thinks I am doing fine, but she only hears the anxious stories as there is not much time since the psych services are in high demand. I used to go to therapy, but they closed as the owner passed away unfortunately. I also don't have the finances or transportation. There's insurance, but I don't know how that works. I've not even worked a day in my life. 

With school, I am at another turning point. I want to change my major again. I'm rerouting, and I don't know what to do. A part of me wants to study a science, but I don't know which one. That's probably something I can talk to a counselor about, but I've gone to a career counselor already for over a year and settled on Recreation(Rec) as my major, but it makes me think...I don't really want to starve and struggle to find a job. I know there's no guarantee with anything almost, but there's not a great demand for Rec, and I can learn those skills on the side of my studies or double major.

I don't know what I am doing. I feel like I'm drying. It's spring break, and I am overwhelmed. I have research papers to write, homework to do, and career research, but I am home...unhappy and listening to music. I should practice driving, but my mother works, gets tired, and watches my little sister too. Everyone seems to have their own life, and I'm trying to get mine together.

It's so easy to just end it all to solve things. I'm not saying I'm going to do that, but I can't organize my thoughts. I don't want to be here. Every time I pause my music, I can hear him talk. I don't want to hear him. I can't focus on my work with music on. I want to get out and improve my life. I want it to be better. I want to get better.

13133,by06fg,stfubrenda,I think a customer at work is being scammed and I don't know what to do.,"I work in a retail store and around the first of the month, every month, an older lady comes and buys a lot of gift cards from us.  She usually spends $1000 at a time and they're always on Amazon gift cards.  A couple months ago she told us that she was sending the gift cards to her fiance in Saudi Arabia so he could buy a plane ticket to be with her.  This week, she has been in 3 times to buy gift cards.  The first time was her usual.  The second time was only a day later, and she only bought $300 worth of them.  She also needed someone to teach her how to take a screenshot.  She showed me her phone and she had sent pictures of the backs of the gift cards to her fiance, but he said he hadn't received any of them.  Today she came in and bought $500 of Google Play cards.  She was happy to announce that he had flown from Saudi Arabia to New York, but unfortunately now he was stuck in ""the New York airport"" because he had some unpaid fees.  She said he had someone from the airport even call her and tell her that they could only accept payment in the form of Google Play cards.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do, as a lowly retail associate, to help her?  We've tried pointing out things that are obvious, like the fact that airports don't accept google play credits as a form of currency, or that you can't buy plane tickets on Amazon, but she doesn't listen to us."

9475,cgegpk,zebrastripegum,Confused on Where I Should Go With My Life,"I'm going to be a bit vague here so as not to out myself to anyone I may know, so please bear with me. I'm a male in my mid-twenties and I really have no idea what I want or should do with my life. Some background about me: I worked as a bartender for years and enjoyed it until I didn't. I have less than a year of college under my belt and am a soldier in the National Guard, holding an intelligence-based MOS which has resulted in myself having a TS security clearance. This didn't help much with the job market without college or active duty time though, and after going back to bartending for a while after training, I have been lucky enough to land an entry-level IT job. This is a regular 9 to 5 type job and honestly the best, most steady job I have ever worked. But it's entry level and will go no where long-term. And now i'm finding myself asking every day what I should do with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel I am behind most people, being mid-twenties with no degree, and I cannot go to a brick and mortar college because I need this job to sustain myself and my girlfriend. Honestly, I just find myself bouncing from one goal to the next, never completing any. I could take classes online but find myself conflicted every day as what to study. I just want something I can be passionate about and live comfortably with. It has also been a dream of mine to travel Asia and live in Japan one day. But I don't know where to go from here. I feel lost, like there's a million things I could try but I put one down and pick a new one up the minute I decide to get serious. I wish I had a clear cut passion and reason to get up in the morning, something I could work at and become really good at and be proud of. Something that would provide me a sense of accomplishment and meaning. How do people decide what they want in life, what their passion is? Is it a natural spark that some people just don't have? I feel like a child in a store that has every candy he could ever imagine, all costing just $1, but all he has is $1 to spend. He has never tried any of these candies, so he just walks around picking up each piece, one at a time, putting them back down. And he's just worried that he'll pick one he doesn't like, or that isn't for him, and that the store is closing soon so he has to choose quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I'm only getting older and don't know what to do with my life. I want a passion but have no real ones and bounce around between subjects/projects never completing any. How does someone find their passion? Or decide what they want to do with their life?"
10215,ccscyi,trafficlight068,Living in constant paranoia and fear of death,"A little backstory

So recently there have been a lot of attempts to defame my name and give me a bad image. The reasons are not really important, but the fact is those allegations eventually made it to the wrong ears. Even though this whole situstion started less than a year ago, it still hasn't died out. Now my problem is that I'm dealing with a group of people that do have police records and are easily capable of killing a person, and in my head I always start thinking about the worst of the worst situations that could happen.. 

How do I get these thoughts out of my head? It especially worsened this week, with not being able to get healthy sleep, always thinking about this and finding that I can't trust people around me on the street. Should I consult a health specialist? And no, going to the police would even worsen the situation (and not having any hard evidence wouldn't help at all). I seriously dont know what to do anymore and so here I am, asking you guys..

17670,bboehx,bluevioletfire,Family members bf pulled out a knife.,"My Aunt was watching my son with her son when she called to get me to pick up my son. I get there and her bf is sloshed outside on the sidewalk drinking out of the bottle . He’s beating the dog “disciplining” him and I try to chop it up with him and get him to feel comfortable, because I felt a vibe. He goes to talk to my Husband at the car.I get inside after talkingto him and my aunt is in a flurry covered in bruises and i am astonished. Idk what’s happening but I know I need to get the kids out ASAP. She tells me to walk her to the car and before I completely walk her to hers I put my son in mine. As she straps her baby in I go over there in the passenger door and there’s blood. He slashed her back tired and cut his hand , the baby is tied up and he pulls her out of the drivers seat a knife to her throat and is threatening her . While stomping on the dog he tells her if she likes what she does to him. I’m screaming and crying at this point begging him to stop. My baby cousin then tells me from his car seat “ ITS OKAY ITS OKAY DONT BE SCARED” so now I’m freaking out because the baby is already programmed with this sort of response. So I pull out my phone and start to call 911 and everybody is staring at me. I tell him I’m scared and he tells me I should be. He was ready for the penitentiary again. My husband is next to him telling him he needs to calm down he’s overreacting and my aunt is crying with a knife to her throat. He finally gives us the green to go. So she gets in the car and we lock the doors my husband runs to his car and start to follow us when he comes at the door again and says he’s gonna see us again. We start to take off when he goes to my husbands door and I’m freaking out because my baby is in the car with him .so we wait for my husbands car to start driving off . We begin to pull away and as we get to the apartments gate we pull too far from the gate code so my aunt has to open her door. And then we hear his sneakers gripping pavement to get to us . He toggles at the handle on beats on the window.She quickly shuts the door and locks it and tries to roll up the window as I grab the wheel and tell her to step on the gas. He then slashes her front tire. As we try to pull off the car is not pulling well but we need to put some distance between us because he is following on foot. I call my husband and tell him we are not going to make it and to have the doors unlocked we have to jump in the car. I unbuckle her son and have him in my arms as she has her sons father on the phone .  We make it to an abandoned gas station no light or anything. I jump out the car and hand the baby off to my husband as I jump in the back seat to hold him . My aunt is grabbing her purse and the baby’s backpack and in all the anxiety leaves her keys in the car. She jumps out of the car and settles for locking the doors rather than look for the keys . We pull away and get away.  We send the men back to go change her tires. Low and behold they come back to ALL 4 tires slashed. So we have to get a tow. I am so scared for her rn. We need to go back . I feel stupid af for not calling the cops when I had the chance to keep them on the line. I’m scared should I make a report? Would my report even matter? He has court this week on aggravated assault charges against another woman. I’m scared if he doesnt get out away he will come after us and if I do make a report he will come after me. I feel like we all need to make a report. I feel like this man was going to kill us. Help"
16913,bfm478,exPANtable,Recently realized my mom wants to control my life,"I just recently had the realization that my mom may have had the thought of controlling me. 

I’m a 16 year old guy.

For as far back as I can recall, she was the no secrets, no private like kind of parent. (I’m living with her only, dad is not in the picture) She taught me that there will be no locks or closed doors in the house. As a kid, This didn’t matter that much, but as of now, it is starting to matter. When I try to nonchalantly bring up closing doors or something similar, she’d either ignore it, or flip out. 

Speaking of flipping out, she’s someone who gets angered extremely easily, to the point where I’m scared to tell some jokes around her. She’s someone who goes from 0 to 100 real quick and over some small petty reason. For example, the other day when I went to wash the dishes, I found some pots that were not sitting in water. This hardens the grease and food bits around the pot making it harder to clean. Since I’m the one cleaning, I usually put it in water first (keep in mind that putting pots and dishes in water is something my mom taught me). So it wasn’t me who didn’t put water. I told my mom that she forgot to put it in water, to which I got a earful of me not respecting her and to just wash it as-is. I tried bringing up maybe soaking the pot for a bit then come back to wash. She proceeded to yell louder for around 5 minutes. 

She also likes taking control of my schedule and what I do and when I do them. She even admitted to doing this one day during an argument. But the thing is, what she said was extremely hypocritical. “I don’t control you much, you have a lot of freedom. All I do is control what you do and when you do it!”
,is basically what she said. This is beginning to take a toll on my social life. Whenever my friends want to go to the mall to play mtg it whatever, she’d say that it’s a waste of time and fears I’ll be snorting cocaine.(I don’t). I mean, if I don’t go, I’ll be at home watching YouTube or playing games and like that is a better use of time. And I can’t have any after school activities unless it’s strictly school related. Oh, my friend want to stay at school to chat? NO! Go home. This rule has been part of my life since I started school in kindergarten. Always go home and finish homework then do whatever. I sometimes feel like doing the opposite and thought she’d agree, being that I finished my homework at the end of the day. Nope, I got a 10 minute lecture about it.

She also likes to guilt trip me in the middle of a disagreement. The most common one is reflecting back when I was like 4 and reminiscing on how much better I was back then. Or throwing a “I RAISED YOU!” card out.

Lastly, she constantly asks what I’m doing if I go silent for a few minutes. She knows what I’m doing, I finished my homework and got nothing to do an a Saturday night. Of course I’d be gaming. Also, if I answer watching videos, I have to go SUPER specific, what am I watching, what is it about, where am I watching it etc. 

What can I do to improve my current condition, tell her how I feel or how to not make this a big deal? I can’t take move out as an option as I’m planning to go to med school and I can’t sustain myself with a job and study fit school at the same time."
23506,9cmw9d,b_utterscotch,I don’t want to tell my parents anything,"My parents have always been the teasing type. Anytime I would mention a girl’s name I would always get a teasing “Ooh is that your girlfriend?” I hate it. It gets so bad that I have to replace all of my girl friends’ “her” or “she” with “him” or “his” just so I don’t have to deal with it. It’s the same with all of my extended family members, too. I’m honestly considering just not telling them that I have a girlfriend when I do actually get one."
24257,990wjj,Partyhelmet,"I moved 1,000 miles away to escape an abusive relationship, to live with my father and get back on my feet. Five days after arriving, and moving everything I had to be here, he beat the shit out of me.","I was in a relationship that was codependent, and abusive. This was my getaway. A chance to become independent. Within two days of moving everything out here, I’m working for a construction company. 12$/hr. I’m doing so well, I enjoy what I’m doing, I feel wholesome. 2 hours before the incident my father is hugging me, telling me how happy he is that I’ve finally had the epiphany (independence and the joy that independence brings). (22m btw)

My father has been my hero my entire life. I moved from one very fucked up relationship to the next. My father and my stepmom are absolutely miserable with each other and turning to substances as a form of self medication for their shortcomings. There’s no communication whatsoever and I tried to be the mediator. Big mistake. 

Long story short, they get into a heated argument. I just moved blind into the middle of this, and I’ve known my dad for 22 years and my stepmom for about 12. I have two brothers. (7 and 10) Them, and two neighborhood boys were staying the night. We were going to grill brats, smothered in caramelized onions and beer cheese. Phenomenal. My dad has had 6 (heavy) vodka drinks and I had about 6 beers. The fight between them started, which was not uncommon. My stepmom runs off visibly upset and hyperventilating, and her being there for most of my memorable life, I go to comfort her and make sure she’s okay. It was successful, I come back inside with her with the hopes of having the good night that we planned and step outside on the patio where my dad is.

“Go. Fuck. Yourself.” He said.

My dad walks back inside. Confused, I follow him in and ask him why he told me to go fuck myself. I push. I’m offended, “why the fuck did you say that? WHY the fuck would you say that?” He follows me outside, at which point he head butts me in the face, gets me on the ground and punches me square in the face. I’ve got a black eye. We wrestle on the ground and I kept telling him that I wasn’t going to fight him. He chokes me out and pins me down in the yard for about 15 minutes. I never fought back. I knew he was drunk, I just didn’t have it in me. Anybody else would’ve been in the hospital. My hero was sitting here beating the shit out of me. I got free, ran, and walked about 15 miles. I fell asleep at a local Starbucks and a family friend (chance in a million, the mother of the other two kids that were there that night) found me there on her way to church. I go back to their house with them, they convince me to return, so I do. Talk it out with him, he takes me for steak and now everything is buddy buddy. I’m a very forgiving person, and I’m the best I know at exercising restraint. (Obviously)

I don’t know how to handle it other than stay on the path that I was on, with the goals I had in mind. Maybe I just needed to get it off my chest. I don’t think I’m handling it that well, I’m very emotionally conflicted here, I’m just going to continue focusing on work and write it off as a hiccup. He’s convinced that I “betrayed” him in his own house by talking to her. I just wanted to grill some fucking brats, man. I don’t know. Thank you for reading, I think I just needed to write it out. 

tl;dr: wanted to grill some brats, and got assaulted with nowhere to go.

side note: on my 15 mile trek into town, I got kissed by a random girl? fun fact :D

side side note: how do I handle this situation, in all seriousness? (Other than continuing to work in order to get the fuck out of this crazy house.)"

I don't want to reach out to the wife because I would be afraid of making her feel inadequate or seem insensitive, and she's already suffering. I know I should probably just not say anything.

I[27] quit smoking weed 2 months ago after being a heavy smoker. I've been having really bad anxiety ever since and want to use it to suppress these feelings. The problem is, I have a gf[27] now and she hates weed. She says that if I smoke or take it in any way, edibles or other, she will break up with me. This only amplifies my anxiety. We were together in the past but weed has lways bothered her and that's why we never worked out. We are trying again and I'm trying not to use weed, but it's really tough since that's how I've coped with anxiety in the past. When I get my anxiety attacks, it makes her emotions go crazy and we end up arguing. I don't know how I can stop my anxiety and I don't want to use weed because I love her. I live in CA where it's now legal if that matters. Any advice on what to do here?

Thanks"
19151,b36h68,maybenottherighttime,My rescue dog has developed serious behavioral issues and I am torn about surrendering her.,"My rescue dog has developed serious behavioral issues and I am torn about surrendering/rehoming her.

&amp;#x200B;

I rescued my dog about a year ago. When we got her, the shelter estimated she was about one year old. They picked her up along the side of major highway — no one came looking for her, so there was no information about her past. She was the quiet one in the corner of the shelter hallway. Her cell was right behind the door so we almost didn’t notice her. When we took her out for a short walk she immediately perked up. She rolled in the grass and panted happily. Someone from the parking lot remarked, “Looks like you’re going home with that one.”

&amp;#x200B;

Only problem was... we’d actually come to adopt a cat.

&amp;#x200B;

We ended up fostering her for two weeks just to try it out. A few issues came forward at the time; She cried in her crate, but what puppy doesn’t? She could get aggressive towards larger dogs, but we didn’t know her past so we rationalized that she was just scared. We thought that the more love we showed her and the more we socialized her the better she’d get. When we finalized the adoption it truly felt like the only option. She’d grown so attached to us in the few weeks that the thought of returning her seemed impossible. We thought it could only get worse for her if she were to be returned.

&amp;#x200B;

Over time, her issues have become more apparent and plentiful.

&amp;#x200B;

She has extreme separation anxiety — extreme may even be an understatement. She has broken out of / busted every single crate we’ve purchased for her. She’s gone so far as to physically harm herself in the process of escaping. Every crate has to be zip tied and clipped shut with climbing carabiners. It has to be anchored away from walls, furniture, anything she can chew or damage through the bars of her crate, etc. She can’t be left out of her crate because she chews furniture, tears up trash, and relieves herself throughout the house. The stuff she consumes in her panic makes her sick. On top of that, she throws herself against doors and windows in an attempt to escape. She can’t be trusted not to harm herself, so she must be kept in a crate. We have tried kong toys, interactive toys, calming treats/cbd oil, vigorous exercise, everything short of straight up prescribing her to anti-anxiety medication that I can’t even afford for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

She’s aggressive with other dogs. Dogs that are smaller, dogs that are larger, dogs that show no interest in her or are overly excited. We can’t seem to get it right when it comes to puppy play dates. Everything may seem to go fine and then randomly in the midst of play she’ll lose it and get aggressive. I feel so much shame and guilt about it every time. I feel horrible leaving her at home, but now I am afraid to take her anywhere that she may have to interact with other dogs. 

&amp;#x200B;

It’s beginning to take a toll on my mental health. I stress relentlessly about leaving her at home — if she’ll break out of her crate, if she’ll destroy the house, if she’ll hurt herself in the process. I’ve begun to resent her and I know she can feel it. I resent the amount of money I have spent on toys and crates and treats and care that have seemingly no positive effect. I resent that I have this animal that is so dependent on me, yet every part of my lifestyle is in direct opposition with her personality. We like to go out and socialize — hiking, patios, parks, etc. But I don’t trust her in these spaces and with other more sociable animals. But she also can't be left behind.

I feel defeated.

I feel like we’re not a match as owner and pet.

I feel like a horrible person for not having fostered this end-all-be-all love relationship with my dog that other owners seem to have with theirs.

My feelings about surrendering/rehoming her have grown stronger and stronger. But I wouldn’t even know where to begin with that process...

I need advice desperately. Has anybody out there dealt with a situation like this? Is there a better place for a dog like this? Am I missing some key component in our relationship that could heal this?"

27835,8pzaam,Cat_Biscuit,Can’t connect with others after depression,"I (f 28) recently went through a major depressive episode.  It was my first experience with serious depression, and it was triggered by a personal trauma I won’t get into here.  The worst of it lasted about 6 months, and it was a really dark time for me.  I’ve recently made some positive changes in my life and started seeing a therapist, and I’ve been feeling so much better.  I have energy and motivation again.  

However, I feel like I’ve lost my drive to socialize. During the worst of my depression I cut myself off from friends and family as much as possible.  I used to have a pretty full social life but I lost a lot of friends while depressed and I just no longer feel a desire to be around people.  I’m close with my parents and have a couple of good friends who I speak to regularly, but mostly social interaction now feels meaningless and draining.  I’ve always been a bit of an introvert, but the pre-depression me used to like people and value friendship.  It seems like depression has fundamentally changed me in this regard, and I wonder if I’ll ever be my old self again.

I guess I’m just curious if anyone else has experienced a shift in their social drive after depression, and what they did to start feeling connected to others again. "
27622,8r2km5,ready2throwaway3,"Is it ever a good idea to bring up having an anxiety disorder / PTSD in a job interview, or to an employer?","I have dealt with near constant anxiety issues for most of my life, combined with mild PTSD stemming from childhood trauma.  This has caused me severe challenges in my education and working life, and it's definitely affected how my resume looks.  It's really tough having to basically walk around in the world having what I've realized (at long last) is a disability that can be as real as being in a wheelchair but it's invisible.  I have a job interview tomorrow.  I've never admitted to any employer I have these issues even though it's something that potentially could impact or affect my performance on a job.  Even though employers always say they will make accommodations for disabilities, the fact is I don't really know how that extends to mental handicaps.  When I get severely stressed due to deadlines for example, I tend to engage in avoidance behaviors - procrastination is basically a very mild form of what I have; my version of it is almost shutting down and being unable to function.  If my job is not that high stress this tends to be something I can manage without it affecting my performance greatly.  The mantra for job interviews is to look as invincible and amazing as possible, toot your own horn, confidence, etc. but to me it smacks of dishonesty especially in my situation.  

From my perspective, dealing with my anxiety has been a tale of courage, I'm proud of how far I've been able to come despite what I've been through.  It's very difficult to get other people to understand who I am or what I'm really capable of without knowing about that.  

My thinking on this is basically not to bring it up though, even though there are many times I want to yell, ""the only reason my GPA is that is because of this!  The reason I took a year off is because of this!  The reason I didn't take the bar exam even though I graduated from law school is this!  The reason I didn't work during law school is because I knew I wouldn't have been able to handle the stress of classes and a job at the same time!"""
12608,c0mpm1,patheticpinata,My Best Friend Is A Catfish,"I’ll get straight into the story. My best friend (let’s call her Bella) is a catfish. I’ve just learnt this and I am really, really disgusted.

Basically, Bella is bi. She is in love with this girl (let’s call this girl Holly), and Holly means the literal world to Bella, or at least I thought that. I’m sure if you asked Bella who her best friend was she’d say Holly (or at least she would a month ago.)

Holly and Bella were in a little squad with three other girls. They were best friends, I was the outsider. I feel I considered Bella my best friend but Bella didn’t consider me hers.

Now. Holly got a bit drunk and a boy asked her to send nudes, and she did. Bella learnt, and flipped, apparently. This was when Bella decided to pretend to be a boy by stuffing things in her pants and asking Holly (and I think the other girls too) for nudes. She nearly got nudes of Holly.

Bella now has basically ran back to me and her other friends she’d forget when her and her squad were still good friends. I learnt all this off another girl (who is a really good friend of mine and I totally trust her), and Bella hasn’t been telling me because she knew I’d flip, and she doesn’t want to lose me.

And I don’t have a lot of friends. And in a way I feel like (I know it’s stupid) but “aww she doesn’t want to lose me I must mean something to someone” but my head is like, “for fuck’s same she doesn’t want to lose you because she doesn’t want to be totally alone and hated by literally everyone.”

I learnt she was a catfish this Wednesday. On Tuesday, we were laughing our heads off, being best friends, basically.

We have a really good friendship, honestly, I know I don’t mean as much as her other friends to her. I don’t want to lose that but do I really want to be friends with someone who literally pulled a James Charles on her supposed best friend?

So, what would you guys do?"

33080,8454fj,anonymoushiya,"Thinking of leaving my job, it could really screw over my boss who is also my friend","Anonymous account as my boss is a Redditor. Apologies if formatting is weird, I’m on my mobile. 

TLDR: I’m thinking of leaving my job and I’m feeling pretty guilty/anxious about it because I think it’ll drop my bosses (who are also my friends) in at the deep end and make it really really hard for them. 

Here’s a summary of the current situation.

I currently work at a desk job for a small company. There’s 15 of us at the moment, we’ve just grown quite quickly so the majority of the team is new (has been working at the company for 6 months or less). After my bosses I’m the next-most-senior person there and I’ve also worked there the longest. 

There used to be 17 of us, but 2 members of staff have just left. The 2 leavers were both quite important/managing a lot of work so my bosses are having to pick up LOTS of extra workload. 

Part of this is that my boss has been trying frantically to promote me up the ladder because they desperately need someone to manage the team. But my priorities have massively shifted since I had my kid and I know that’s not what I want anymore. 

Promotion would mean more travel, more stress, more working night and weekends. Nope nope and nope. 

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and balancing home / work life since I’ve come back off maternity leave about a year ago. So my boss is also helping me out more than they’d normally need to.

I’ve had a few outbursts at work that are really out of character (crying about stuff that was NBD) and it made me wonder if I was in the right role. 

I’ve been seeing a career coach and I’m considering going freelance in my field. I have experience running a small company and I’m confident I can make it work. I’m now putting sales and marketing plans in place and developing a brand and getting my network keyed up. 

Mainly, I need flexibility as my kid has some health issues and the guilt of trying to keep up at work combined with seeing the quality of my own work start to slip is really getting me down.

Complicating factor: my bosses are also my friends. I respect them a lot. I’ve learned HUGE amounts working with them. They were really flexible and understanding when I went on maternity leave and have been really supportive since I’ve been back. I think they believe I’ll never go. 

So! I’m feeling SUPER anxious and guilty about handing in my notice. If/when I go, there won’t be anyone other than my bosses that’s worked at the company for more than 6 months. I have a long notice period so there would be at least a bit of time to help with the transition and training of my replacement. But I feel like I’ll just be dropping my bosses in at the deep end. 

Questions:

If it were you, what would you do?

Does anyone have any advice about how to have the “I’m leaving” conversation?

Do you think I’m a jerk for leaving?

Has anyone out there made the transition from employed to freelance? Could you share your experience? "
11038,c8pm10,InitialHeart,Do I continue dating a person who is mentally unwell?,"I've recently moved to New York and starting dating a new person 3 months ago. We see each other several times a week and have met each other's friends and some family on quite a few occasions. I have previously suffered from depression and started on medication earlier this year. However, since being with my new partner, I have found that I feel a lot better (which may be due to the medication but he has likely contributed to my positive mood). I'm also currently training as a CBT therapist, so I have a lot of experience when it comes to mental health. On our 3rd/4th date, he let me know that he is on anti-depressants and that he has good/bad days - he explained that he felt comfortable talking to me about it because he trusts me. I let him know that I'd always be here if he needed some support. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things had been going great but over the past few weeks I've been pretty worried. We had been acting like a couple but hadn't had the official ""chat"" yet about what we are. However, I brought it up after we spent 3-4 days away with each other. During this time, I noticed that he had cuts up his arms which looked very fresh and after a few drinks, he mentioned that he'd previously gone to therapy for self-harming but left as it wasn't working. I understand that everyone has a past, but I'm very worried about active cutting and how much he may actually be struggling at the moment. He also mentioned crying frequently while I was away but he tends to bring it up more after we've had a glass of wine. He'll often shut down and change the subject after I try to speak to him about it. We then had a chat after I saw the scars etc and he explained that he really likes me and has no desire to see other people but that he can't bring himself to agree to an official relationship due to his current mental state. He stated that he can't look after himself at the moment and doesn't want to let me down if I need him when he's going through a bad phase. However, we both love spending time together so agreed that we both wouldn't see other people and see how it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I can't really work out what to do about this situation. If we're not in an official relationship, I feel that it's not my place to try and assist him getting help if he's actively cutting and at the moment I just feel really helpless. I'm very open to providing support but I just don't want to continue things for months and end up being gutted if it still doesn't go anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciate some advice. I've been in relationships previously with partners with mental illness and feel that I'm more empathetic than most due to my job. However I feel that there's deep routed issues that need addressing if he's self-harming and I'm not sure whether he'll address them if I'm always there. I don't want to worsen things for him by leaving but if we're not in an official relationship, I feel that I may struggle in this situation. I'd really appreciate any advice."

I was doing my homework, minding my own business when all the sudden my mom just enters my room with like a screw driver and some sort of device in her hand. She was tearing it apart. She went on to tell me that she found a camera installed in the clock in their bedroom and was obviously quite disturbed which also freaked me out as well. She told me to check my clock and to our surprise we found another camera. 

I don’t know what his intentions were installing cameras in our bedrooms, or if there are more cameras around the house.

I’m paranoid that there are more cameras around my house now, but the fact that he one in my bedroom where I change and do private stuff really disgusted me..

My mom called him immediately and told him he was a pervert and to never call us again or come back to the house. He literally had no excuse for why he had done this. All he did was say he could do whatever he wants since it’s his house and he pays the rent.

In April, at 3 years, I was looking for jobs and told this to my supervisor and that I would be quitting ASAP because I could not stay a postdoc forever. He promised to promote me in the summer. I did everything for my promotion, including an hour long seminar covering my entire career that took ages to prepare and 7 interviews with staff. Boss told me I was now promoted and I would see the changes in system on Monday.

Monday passed, a week passed, nothing happened so I asked him. He pushed the date by 2 months - “expect to see it change at the new fiscal year, oct 1.” Before oct 1 I asked if everything was prepared and he said yes. Oct 1 passes and nothing changes. He tells me it’s almost done and will be back-dated and back-paid to oct 1. 

Now it’s mid October and the plan has changed again. Now it turns out he is required to post a job opening internally and externally and leave it up for 30 days, interview other good candidates, and THEN he plans to pick me. So another few months before things go through, wasting my time and others.

I want to quit, but I don’t have anything else lined up because the only other thing I would really want to do is look for professor jobs, which are all starting next fall. So that is exactly what I am doing, but it is becoming increasingly hard to work for my boss and I want to quit now on principle. 

TLDR; I want to quit my job bc of a boss who constantly goes back on what he says and delayed promotion, but it is probably better for my career to stay another (almost) year. What should I do?"

Is there any way to trace back someones Instagram? A crazy ex-best friend of mine (of 3 years, and this has come out of no where) has one or two crazy minions and I have been targeted today by an online Instagram troll. While I’m not trying to give it too much attention, the troll released personal information about me having a miscarriage which is information only my ex-best friend and BF knew about. This is also something that happened 3+ years ago so don’t know why it’s being used now to ‘poke fun’ at me, and even why that sort of thing would be ‘fuel’ to use against someone at all. I’m pretty sure it’s her as BF and I are very private and did not share that event with anyone but my Mum and ex-best friend. Mum would never tell. Ex-best friend is angry because I moved on to healthier friendships so I can see her telling someone or even having a lot to do with this troll.

I think this person realised their fuck up and basically wiped their entire catfish account. Changed the username, set to private, 0 followers and 0 following. I have nothing to go off from aside from the old catfish username and a screenshot of them calling me a “natural baby killer” and a “slut”. The account also only seemed to be created today too as the only post on there (now deleted) was posted today. 

Mostly posting this for BF’s sake because he wants the solid proof that they’re behind it so he can perhaps take it further as he is FURIOUS.

We live in a large home (decent backyard, 2 floors, huge basement, massive living room, open concept etc) as my other siblings and mom used to live here too but have since moved to another city for schooling/work. My dad pretty much works 8-8, I go to class maybe 3 times a week as lectures are recorded, and my older sister is between jobs right now. There would definitely almost always be someone at home to watch it, and our neighbourhood is quiet and perfect for walks. We all really want a puppy but are nervous! We don't know what to expect at all. Can you guys shed some light on your experience with raising a puppy? "
11229,c7p7vz,lavender21,How much should I pay for rent in NYC as a student?,"I’m moving to NYC in the fall for school. It is a 4 year program and I realize it’s an extremely expensive city to live in but I received a great scholarship and really want to experience the big city life. 

I’ve been looking around, and cheapest options would be $1200+ utilities with roommates while making a lot of compromises on location and the type and state of the apartment I want to live in. Transportation costs would probably be almost $200 monthly and take a lot of time out of my days for commuting to class. 

My other option is for a $1900+ place that is walking distance to everything I want and I wouldn’t need to buy a monthly bus/subway pass. It probably comes to $600-700+ extra a month. Can I afford this or should I try to scrimp and save every penny? If I went with this more expensive option, I’d try to find a part time job to offset some of the costs and pull in $1000+ extra per month. 

After scholarships, my only expenses would be $8k/year for tuition+books and then my living costs. Cellphone is $45/monthly and food is about $200/monthly but probably double the amount if I live in NYC. 

I’m 22 years old and have $125k saved at the moment, with no debt. I quit my well paying job just 2 weeks ago because I hated it, and wanted to take two months to take care of myself before school starts.

It’s also very easy to find a job in this field of study once I graduate, and I should expect to make minimum $70k/yr even in my small and cheap home town. 

My parents say I should just bum it out and live as cheaply as possible and save every penny. This philosophy is what has allowed me to save $125k, but I haven’t been able to enjoy my life the way I want. I did my first bachelors in a field of my parents’ choosing, and went to college while living at home. Hated it all and I view it as a waste of 4 years of my life. Didn’t have a social life or any control over my own life. That’s why I want to move far from home to NYC. 

Any advice? Thanks."

393,ds1iwa,4NfgB7eY,My professor claims I slandered them?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I am a graduate student at a large American university. A while ago, I received a poor module grade. The feedback contained various strange statements, for example, that my paper did not contain X even though it did. It also said that they would have expected a better paper of a talented student, and that my paper was not at graduate level. The remark sounded very snide. Even if it were made in good faith, it did not sound as though she was weighing my paper impartially, but rather in comparison to what I am like in class.

At my university there is a teaching board, comprised of students and professors, there to discuss student feedback on modules. The action I took next was to let the student member know what had happened. I asked them to mention that feedback would ideally not include the professor's judgment of the student as a person, since this kind of feedback is generally not helpful, and a bad grade should not have anything to do with the student's 'talents'. 

I also wrote a response to the professor in I said that I did not find personal statements appropriate, and that I asked for this point to be made at the teaching commission with all persons remaining anonymous. 

In the professor's response, they sounded extremely contrite at first. I then replied to say that I would just like to move forward.

A few days later, I got yet another email from this professor. Essentially, they wanted to make this a point on the agenda of the annual teaching evaluation, since I had 'slandered their name'. They had forwarded the correspondence to other professors, removing my name but leaving enough information to identify me.

I fear that this professor has used this as an opportunity to make herself appear as though she has been wronged. I have not told anyone but the one other student, so I am not sure why she claims that I have slandered her. In fact, the other professors may not want to work with me now for fear of me being 'difficult'. I have no idea what to do, and whether I should (or can) do anything."

2413,dh5vxt,upwardoverdmountain,I don't know what I want,"Now that I think of it, my parents never really let me be my own person.

At a young age, whenever I would tell them something that I like to do, they would always tell me no, that I should only do just this or just that, and when I try to do it anyway because I somehow know it would be good for me, they would tell me I'm being disrespectful; when I would tell them something I'm interested in, they would discourage me of the subject and I end up giving in and thinking that they're probably right when I also know in my gut that they're not.

Now that I'm an adult, I have no fucking clue about what I want in life because a little voice in my head keeps telling me whatever it is I would want is wrong. I suck at making decisions, and people around me keep rushing me to make up my mind already and telling me I'm only wasting my time."

Tonight I left some beans boiling on the stove top and went to the gym. After, I had three texts and two missed calls from my landlord. He had to go upstairs to my apartment to shut off the smoke alarm. 

This afternoon I was going through my closet and took out a bunch of weed paraphernalia that he definitely would have walked by. Smoking is not permitted in the apartment and I don't do it. But I do smoke and do own stuff to smoke with. I had taken a bunch of stuff my ex-boyfriend had left with me. On the floor was: Rolling papers, a blunt wrap, grinder, 2 bowl pipes, a tiny joint, two pens and a few empty cartridges. I'm sure he had no idea what the cartridges were. My clothes were also sprawled about - so the room looked pretty bad. 

He, naturally, sounded pissed when I talked to him. Obviously, I almost started a fire. This is on top of me locking myself out twice in the past month.

I'm concerned about the weed, too. My sister told me to not worry about it, because its legal where i live. My friend told me to write him a card and give him a bottle of wine (?). Not only did I make this guy think his house was burning down, then he saw a ton of shit on the ground, that he had no clue was in his house and he's probably super confused about me.

My objective is to: let him know I am not smoking in his house, apologize for almost lighting his house on fire, downplay all the weed paraphernalia somehow."
13974,btskx0,mandala23,"Found out my dad has cancer, from facebook.","So about 3-4 years ago I my dad was diagnosed with cancer in his throat and lymph node in his throat. I was living at home at the time. 

My parents told me face to face and it was confusing and devastating. I knew cancer was bad but it was my first time seeing it first hand and I had no idea what to expect. It was horrible. The chemo and radiation therapy was brutal. He lost most of his hair on his head and he had to be fed through a tube for most of the time because he couldn't eat, it was too painful for him. I remember nights waking up to him crying because the chemo would make him vomit, since his throat was blistering and sore from the radio therapy that it would make him scream and cry every time he did. He had damaged nerves from the treatments and couldn't move his arms up. He missed out on a lot because he was too tired and unwell, like Christmas and birthdays. I don't think he realised but it really affected my mother too, she was running her own business, looking after us four kids and looking after him too. 

It was really traumatic for everyone. 

Eventually he got better and he was cleared from cancer and was put on watch incase it came back. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast forward to now** and the doctor has found more cancer in his prostate. 

I don't know much about it, because I found out late last night, but you'd have to assume that cancer going from one end of your body to the next isn't a good sign. 

My mum texted me last night and she said that they found cancer in him again and that she wanted to tell me quickly before I read about it on facebook... Yeah he posted about it on facebook before telling any of his family. 

My sister didn't even get the heads up text from my mum, she actually saw it on facebook first. 

Mum kept saying that it just a little one that they can take out and it's not a big deal... but how isn't it a big deal. 

I got a text from my dad this morning apologising that he didn't tell us first, that he wrote it on facebook because he hates talking about it, but now he's created a bigger conversation with hundreds of 'facebook friends'. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be selfish and let myself be angry at my parents, but I can't help but to feel extremely hurt. I live out of home now so I wont get to be with them as much as I'd like.

Ever since I was a kid my parents used to tell people that I have autism whenever I behaved a little coy or
make eye contact.

However, their comments about this have recently become a LOT more frequent, to the point where whenever I can’t hear something someone said or I understood something the wrong way or I’m just, idk, me being awkward, they rub in my face how I’m autistic.

It’s just so WEIRD and I don’t know where it’s coming from. I don’t think I have autism? I mean, I’ve never noticed anything, and neither have any of my friends or relatives or anyone besides my parents, and they’ve never spoken to a doctor either.

At first I thought they might be joking or tastelessly and misguidedly insulting me, but they sound really really serious and convinced about the topic, as though it’s one of the great truths of the universe.

No offence to actual autistic people, I really hope that my lack of education on the topic isn’t accidentally insulting or hurting you, please tell me if I did something wrong, but at this point I’m just a little bit sick of their constant comments. I don’t UNDERSTAND what this situation is about.

I'm  just about to finish my undergraduate degree in 2 months. I have lost all motivation. My life seemed all planned out. I'm not sure what exactly happened along the way.

I have medical school lined up right after I finish my degree, currently doing a paid internship at a big  IT company (Forbes Top 50 regarded Companies). Broke up with a loving girlfriend of 3 years.

Over the past few weeks I haven't gone to work, left without a notice, I couldn't deal with the pressure from college and work. Instead of focusing on finishing my degree, I just keep procrastinating. I feel sleepy all the time and cannot do anything. I'm starting to struggle with my degree, just passing everything. I just need to pass everything to get into medical school. My girlfriend couldn't deal with it, so she left.

I have spent hours and hours programming, ""improving myself"", constantly working to get where I am. In this process, I have lost all friends, most were too busy socialising and networking at the time.

I've started hating my passion of programming, I don't think I can handle any more programming, it feels like demeaning work. My other subjects all seem difficult and every time I try to catch up I just feel like giving up. I feel like I've blown my internship, no one has called me, I haven't received a word yet. I don't feel like waking up these days. There's nothing lined up for me.

Right now the only thing which I feel could make my life better is - if I got into med school and became a doctor. Even this idea seems to be slipping away. 

I regret not going to work, I regret not telling anyone about this. I regret spending so much time working - work which seems to have led to nothing. I regret not spending time with my friends or my girlfriend.

I feel like I've fucked up my life. I don't even know what the purpose of my life is anymore. There has been nothing that made me happy for months. Am I just a tool for society to function better? I don't know.

I keep wanting to dream in order to spend time with my friends from school and my girlfriend, I wish my life was simpler. I wish that I took my life a little easier, I wish I still lived with my parents. Maybe my life wouldn't suck.

My mind has been hazy for a while now, so please ignore grammatical errors etc. 

I know harming myself won't fix anything, I've attempted it once and decided never to do it again. =&gt;

Sleeping pills + Alcohol + cold beach. In the face of death I just laughed and realised that it was pointless, the things leading me to death were pointless.

But now I feel like life itself is pointless, so is death. Death right now sounds like a happier option.

Long story short:  
Should I still try med school? If so how can I motivate myself to study/do things I hate?

How do I deal with loneliness?

How should I deal with my internship?

How should I deal with wanting to have friends and my girlfriend?

How should I deal with suicidal thoughts?

How should I deal with the meaninglessness of life?

How should I fix my hazy mind?

We confided in each other more than we have with anyone before. We were also very intimate and active in that aspect of the relationship. She has many insecurities most of which are physical so I do everything I can to respect them and help with them. We got into our first argument recently which was a result of her not wanting to have a serious talk about where this relationship is going. She explained that it made her uncomfortable so I apologized and told her that I understand things are uncomfortable but need to be talked about. After that I left the subject alone for about a month. Now I am getting ready to ship out for the army and have been bringing up the topic quite frequently. She has said that she wants to commit and have a relationship with me but I haven’t seen proof of it. I tried to sit her down and talk to her to tell her how much I cared for her and wanted to see this through but I needed her to actually commit with her heart and not just say it. I tried to talk to her for 3+ hours and she didn’t say a single word, she only shrugged. I understand it’s not an easy decision especially with me leaving for the army. I don’t want to go to basic thinking that when I’m done she will be waiting for me when she’s actually with a new guy or just not interested in me anymore. Through all of this I never said anything harmful or insulting to her but she has said some pretty rude and uncalled for things. She also told me that she doesn’t want to be with me anymore just to see how I would react to it which tore me apart. To her I am the bad guy and she doesn’t think anything that she has said or done is wrong. Her friends, family and even her all say it is my fault that this relationship is deteriorating. She is too prideful to admit that anything she does is wrong and I feel like that is how we got to this point. It’s almost to the point of hubris. I really don’t know what to do anymore so I would appreciate some advice because I care for her so much and would hate to see all the time, effort and emotion I put into this go to waste.

24209,99a9dk,CalmConnection,Did I handle the situation correctly?,"I've recently had a falling out with friends who I used to live with. I moved out a few days ago.

I told them I wished to move out as it wasn't my kind of environment and i was very unhappy there. The reasons I wanted to move out were because:

\-all they do is smoke weed, i would come home and they've done nothing all day. This made me lose all my motivation to do work. I don't smoke weed so it wasn't really my vibe.

\- two of them are dating and they have hour long screaming matches every second day which made me very anxious

\- one of them never tidied up the whole time i lived with them and expected others to tidy up after them. one time i asked them to put out their rubbish that had accumulated for over two weeks and they asked why i couldn't do it. This same person would always eat my food.

\- They also thought it was okay to let people stay in my room if i wasn't home.

I didn't tell them any of this as I thought it may come across as me being rude or attacking them. after I told them I wanted to move out they then began to be really hostile, intentionally barging into me in the hallway, yelling and screaming at me, taking my wet washing off the line right after i hung it out, talking badly about me while i was in the house etc. 

I handled this was by somewhat ignoring not really talking to them and instead focussing on my work, this meant I'd come home and go straight to my room. I essentially only spoke to them when necessary regarding moving out but if they spoke to me I wouldn't ignore them

30552,8d0pqz,Gokunese,Doing Terrible in High School,"[Background]: 10th Grader who is suffering from fatigue, anxiety, and a bit of depression (Not suicidal). All this.... because of playing videogames all day, everyday. 

I just don't have the motivation to work hard in any of my subjects anymore. Last year, which was 9th, I ended up with a good GPA &gt;3.6 (Definitely had no C's or low B's in my classes), and I had the intent of getting 4.0's for the rest of the 3 years; however, my procrastination started to grow immensely without me realizing it. 1st semester of 10th grade rolled by, and I was doing far better than last year since I had A's in all my non-AP courses &amp; B+s in my AP's (took 3 AP's, 3 PreAP, and an On-Level). However, I never studied for the final exams and ended up failing one AP test, getting a 70 on the other; got A's on all my Pre-Ap tests though, and a B in Biology (I was busy playing Roblox, so I never studied). Basically, I could've done better if I actually worked hard; but I didn't. Then, after Winter Break ended, I stopped doing homework, stopped studying for unit tests, stopped caring about school, and also stopped caring about others. This didn't magically happen, it was building up gradually to the point where it became apparent. Started failing my quizzes and tests in PreAP and AP courses, and now I'm a low-B student; I don't even want to know what my GPA is anymore (C's in my APs and low B's in my PreAP courses).
 
Every morning, I always tell myself that I'll try my best at school, but I end up just not listening to the lectures, or even doing the assignments for homework. It's weird because a part of me makes me feel guilty and miserable, while the other side soothes me for the actions I've made thus far. To top off my shitty school grades, I have to study for the ACT/SAT next year for college admission; and oh boy, you guessed it, haven't even read a single page of any of my review books or taken any serious practice tests. Again, all this because I'm too depressed to even care about school and my future. 

Anyways, it's not like I never put in effort from the beginning, since I did excellent throughout middle school, but instead, it's like quitting a commitment you've made, halfway through, due to external/internal pressures. 

Just need some advice to remove the clutter stuck in my head before the 2nd semester of 10th grade ends, and to help destroy the dark shackles for 11th grade &amp; beyond. I want to restore my former self, who used to work diligently and barely cared about videogames (This is how I was in Middle School so it isn't a fantasy, hopefully)."

10895,c9b0n2,tahax283,Smiling is uncomfortable for me. It hurts my cheek muscles.,Maybe it's because I'm doing it wrong. I tend to smile with my mouth closed. But my cheeks hurt from doing this whenever it gets to a really wide smile and I can't help it. How do I stop making painful smiles? Maybe I should show my teeth or just not smile so wide (the latter would definitely take a lot more commitment as I naturally tend to smile very wide when speaking or listening to people).
11938,c3wooe,StrwbrryChsck90,How do I not be a horrible person?,"Warning, this might sound like whining. Please read at your leisure.

Everyday it’s the same thing. If I don’t have work, I stay in my bed all day. Even when I have work, I maybe eat and then stay in bed for the rest of the day. I do nothing else.

I used to enjoy video games and reading. Now it’s all so pointless and boring. There are games and books I haven’t finished and more I haven’t even started.

I have no friends. I know most people would say that and maybe have one or two people they aren’t close to. I mean that quite literally. I have NONE. Coworkers are strictly that; I only use a polite, tolerant attitude to not cause problems. I don’t text anyone, and I don’t go out. I actually don’t like being nice. Perhaps it’s because I’m not used to it but being nice to anyone is very exhausting. 

No I don’t live alone, but I wish I did at times. I still live at home with my mother and two younger brothers. I’m not close to any of them. I can easily say that I don’t have many feelings for my family except for indifference. Communication with them is mostly through text, which I ignore 75% of the time.

I’ve never been in a relationship and I don’t know if I want to. Well, no, I’m sorry. I can’t say never. I have had one dalliance that I very much regret because I didn’t even like the guy. I was slightly more optimistic when I was younger and just wanted to say I’ve been in a relationship. I couldn’t stand being around him but it went on for I think 2 months. I felt nothing when we were together and I think that was mostly because I didn’t like him. I don’t know if I want to try a real relationship. I don’t think I could stand actually having to talk to someone all the time. I don’t like talking.

I don’t know how to change and part of me doesn’t want to. It’s easier to complain and not change anything. That’s basically how I “live” my “life.” The other part does want to change but I don’t know how. I don’t know how to start. Asking for help via internet isn’t the best option but it’s the easiest. I’m sure I come off as crazy and a complete whiner. I know I am. But I will take any real advice that I can get. 

What do I do? How do I be someone completely opposite?

16133,bjpwpc,thepoormanguise,This 13 yr old might be getting inappropriate with my dogs in a sexual way.,"Sorry for any typos. I’m upset.This is something I pushed to the back of my mind because I thought it was just a weird thing I had misinterpreted. I have now come to realize it may be a frequent thing. So, I live with my mom. Her boyfriend and son joined us about two years ago. One time I had caught the son laying on his back with my dog between his legs. When he spotted me, he urgently moved to his feet. I immediately saw red flags. I’ve come to notice that he over explains himself when he lies. He did so without me saying a single word when I caught him. I also noticed that despite being indifferent to the dogs, he did a suddenly began liking them overnight. Fast forward to today (maybe a 7 month gap), I went downstairs to let the dogs out. They had gone downstairs before me and there was about a 2 minute delay between them going down and me following. I go into the kitchen and the kid has his pants down. The fly is down and one of my dogs is in front of him. You can always hear someone going down the stairs in my house unless you’re not paying attention. So, he was focused on something. He sees me, goes “oh fuck” and turns around. He then goes on to explain (without me saying a word) that he was checking his penis because it had been red and itchy all day. Ten minutes later, he goes on to ask me what a UTI because he was looking up his symptoms. For some reason, he waited two hours of me being home to ask.  I admit I don’t like him very much. He’s disrespectful and loud. Am I making a huge deal out of nothing? Is personal bias getting in the way? My instincts are telling me something very wrong was happening both times, but I don’t want to escalate the situation if it doesn’t seem like anything to you guys."

My extremely religious parents just gave me (17) a ten weeks notice to be kicked out of the house to be independent, all for being sexually active.","So obviously I'm a bit shaken right now so I apologize if I leave out some crucial details. For context, about 6 months ago my parents found out my now ex and I had sex and they totally flipped out. Although I've never really liked the status of my ex and I's relationship, over that time it basically just resorted to hookups. She's also the only girl I've ever been with. Just today my parents found out that we hooked up again (i've also been caught in the months prior) and proceeded to take my phone, my car, and sent me a formal note (see below) forcing me to leave. 

I currently have a steady job at Target where I make $13 an hour and have $3300 in the bank. I have steady grades and take plenty of AP classes, I'm a pretty smart kid. Right now getting myself to college is the priority and I've applied to several colleges but I doubt I'll be able to afford the out of state schools. I'm waiting to see if I qualified for the Army ROTC scholarship which would cover 3-4 years. My goal is to become an army officer. It's an extremely competitive scholarship so right now I have to assume that I won't get it. 

I truly don't even know where to begin. Whether I should get a phone, a car, how I'll pay for college, where I'll live come march, or whether I should just save my money I really don't know. If any of you guys have any advice on steps to take I am dying to hear it, my life literally depends on it.

And regarding my parents, to be honest I'm not even mad at them.  Because I know they got tired of getting lied to but ultimately I just know that me hooking up with a girl does not warrant this kind of response. After all I could be doing much worse. 

I love all you guys and I'd be lying if I said I don't need you right now, I can't do this alone.

Usually, he'd play PS4 on the weekend or go to the mall with his friends, but recently, he's been locking himself in his room for hours. He'd only come out during dinner or lunch. My parents are concerned and asks him whether or not he's okay or is he having depression. He tend to avoid these questions and not answering them. One time, I knock on his room because I wanted to talk to him, make sure hes okay, he scolded me off and said he's sleeping and wanted to be left alone. His teacher also told me that he's not paying attention to the lessons and was always daydreaming.

As his sister, I want to help my brother, because I knew how stressful secondary school life is for me. 
But with him avoiding and ignoring me every time he sees me, I have no idea what I should do to help him.

15899,bkqmoh,Mermaidtail2019,My Boyfriend is constantly on the phone and it’s very annoying. My resentment is building.,"My boyfriend is 44 and I am 40. He moved from another city to come live with me and I thought it would be me, him and my children. After he moved in I soon realized that he was on the phone calling and texting family and friends all of the time. In fact he texts people on 4 different apps, does video chats and calls. When he first started his new job, he started texting his coworkers and calling to talk his co workers.   He gets home and he will text them. When he is reading the text, he chuckles and I feel he is trying to make me jealous when he does that. I’ve looked at his call records and he calls a lot of people on his days off. What I find funny is that he initiated most of this communication. I’ve never seen someone have a need to communicate with other people so much in my life. When we’re relaxing and watching tv, he suddenly starts texting someone. I’m not on the phone that much because I’m not much for talking on the phone. I text with a couple people, but not all of the time.  I don’t really communicate with my coworkers outside of work and am ok with that. Sometimes I feel resentful with how much time he spends on the phone. Is that wrong of me to feel that way?  Is it normal for a person to be on the phone that much?

TL;DR:  my boyfriend is on the phone a lot calling and texting family and friends. Is that normal?  Is it bad that I’m beginning to resent him for it?"

I come here today to ask for advice on my father.  My father is very depressed, and for my entire life (I'm 21) he has used me as a therapist.

I am terrified of what this would do to him.  I know that it would destroy him, and my dad, who I love so much, would never be the same.  I want to help, but I know that there is nothing that I can do.  I'm looking for advice, please help!"
32439,85y1ot,DrFate21,I picked psychology,"Hey! First time here and thought it was a good time to visit since I'm in the middle of one of my biweekly panic attacks about my future. I am male, 21 years old and will be starting my final year of undergraduate school in the fall and will graduate in spring 2019, so basically I have one year before I need to figure shit out. 

As you probably figured by the title I'm a psychology major (with a minor in criminal justice) and I have no f***ing clue what I want to do with it. I realized after it was too late that any real job that I'd want to get in psychology would require me to get at least a master's, but most likely a doctorate but I can't afford to get either of those seeing as I'm barely scratching by as it is, let alone the fact that even if I did go get further education, the jobs in psychology that interest me don't pay nearly enough to make up for the debt that would ensue during graduate education. So I guess what I'm asking is what you all think I should do, as I certainly have no clue. I have no real interest in a particular subfield of psychology but don't know what else I'd want to do either. I know I didn't really give a lot of information to give advice on but at the very least it felt good to type it out. If you got all the way through this, thanks for reading!"

I slept off my fever and woke up to check our company IM and my email. I received a note from an “equal” of mine who had been there just a little longer letting me know she had been let go. 

She was let go basically because they are making cuts because we aren’t generating the revenue they had anticipated. So it would make sense on that front that I would be let go too. 

Being a nervous wreck I went in after hours tonight and checked my station, everything was there. I logged in to all of our systems no problem...except for one. I am the only person with access to a customer-facing function, and it has been taken away from me.

I’m not into drinking or smoking weed which I feel dooms me as far as being social and I have a hard time relaxing and just having fun. 


I have no girlfriend/ haven’t been kissed which worries me because I feel like the older I get the weirder this will become and I’ll just die a virgin. Last year, I lost 40 pounds (I was 6’0 240 lbs) and even with that I still feel like I’m unattractive and to make things worse I’ve practically stopped working out and dieting. I don’t really have many hobbies and interests outside of video games and music so I’m not interesting either.

6445,cvcy20,throwawayacornblue,99% sure he’s cheating,"-.1% because I truly love him and I don’t want to believe it. I apologize if this is scattered. I’m a fucking mess right now. Posting here because I couldn’t post to r/relationshipadvice 

My female “friend” moved in with us about a month ago. Ever since then, my boyfriend has been playfully hitting her and asking her if he’s sexy (he says he’s joking, but I don’t like it). He does a lot of nice things for her without her asking him to. When I confronted him about him touching her too much and not paying me any attention to me, I was told I was crazy. 

There was one time he was supposed to pick me up from work and supposedly he fell asleep and his phone died. Funny how the phone still rang every time I called even though it was dead? The friend wasn’t answering her phone either until 20 minutes later when she said “he’ll be there in a bit.” Which is odd because according to him she was asleep and didn’t wake him up. He just woke up on his own. Huh. 

Well, they’ve developed a habit of “going for a walk” after getting drunk on a night I go to bed early for work. They don’t tell me when they go or where they go. When they go, neither of them answer their phone. They’re just alone together at night not answering the phone. 
 
Last night was one of those nights. They left at 4am for over an hour after he had told me he was going to come to bed in a few minutes. I didn’t know they left. I was really worried about him so I kept calling him and got no answer. Friend of course wasn’t answering her phone either. When they finally got home he again said his phone died. And she just wasn’t answering her phone. Phone kept ringing again. Weird. 

But alllll that time they were off doing whatever the fuck they were doing, I was talking with his friend who has been seeing my “friend.” He’s noticed their behavior towards each other too. He told me something very disturbing that I can’t get out of my head for the life of me. “One of the nights I was over and the 3 of us were drinking he drunk mentioned outdoor sex a least 6 times, 3 of the times specifically mentioning getting grass pieces in the butt crack, (girl) acting weird towards these comments. Later that night when me and her got together she had 2 grass pieces on her down there.. that was the beginning of my suspensions. I'm sorry if I'm making it worse for you but I notice alot about people's attitudes and energy I dont forget it.” That’s not just a coincidence, right?? 

Anyway, when they got home I had that burning in my brain and I was furious. I went crazy. I shouldn’t have. I told him “I swear to god if you’re cheating on me we are done.” To which he replied by telling me I’m crazy for thinking he was doing that. I explained to him all of the weird things that have been happening that would make me think that and he still said I was crazy. Yet he had no explanation for why things didn’t add up. 

So I dumped him right then. And now I’m wishing I hadn’t done that when I was so emotional. After that, I left. But before that, I informed them both that “if y’all are fucking around then one of you better come clean.” Again, I shouldn’t have done that. I don’t know 100% that they’re having an affair. I have no concrete evidence. But I have this gut feeling because of all these things that I cannot ignore. And I’m mad at myself for wanting to fix it. He’s blaming me for ruining our relationship, his and his friends relationship, and his friend and my friend’s relationship and I feel so bad. But like... I’m not crazy for thinking something isn’t right, right? I don’t know what to do. I fucked up. This is all fucked up. I’m sorry."
