I'm scheduled to start my road trip holiday today. I need to drive some 350 km, and I need to depart in about 3 hours, according to my pre-planned schedule, in order to visit some places along the way.

Unfortunately, my lovely roommate had decided to throw a rowdy house party, and between drunken people banging on my doors and the cops showing up at 3am, I wasn't able to get any sleep up until now. Best I can hope for is a short powernap, but that's hardly gonna cut it.

I reckon that with the nap, I could power through the drive. But I'm probably going to be groggy for the rest of the day, so I probably wouldn't do any of the things I wanted to anyway. I could theoretically postpone by one day, but I don't want to do that either, since I'd either need to reschedule my accommodation and/or replan my route (which might not be possible / could involve a 800 km drive in one day). I'm also going alone, so no one else can drive for me.

She has been this way since she was born, and we believe it to be inherited from her father's side, who had passed away in her childhood due to issues with health. As far as I know, it's been this way on his side of the family. Starting off small, until it eventually comes to a head -- and then death.

Of course, that's something we want to avoid. We've been going for about a year now, and it's by this time that I usually grow tired of whomever woman I'm dating (I know, it's a horrible thing to say), but this time's a bit different. I love this girl deeply, and I really want to commit to what we have now. The only problem is, as the title suggests, her condition.

I find it a bit hard to know how I should continue with our relationship knowing her condition, and being idle about it. She's very sick, and she visits the hospital quite frequently. Due to how she is, however, she often visits when things have progressed a bit too much. 

A bit of background on the type of person my GF is, she's an amazing woman. She always gives her best in everything she does and is selfless beyond compare. She gives herself fully to whatever she commits to and is never afraid to sacrifice her own well-being for the sake of a goal, a friend, or anything she values, really. She's very friendly, and she's often taken advantage of due to how she is, much to my dismay. 

What's preventing me from acting on her health is that she's pushing me away in fear of hurting me, and isn't letting me visit or physically see her in fear of making me worry or making me sad. This is making my current situation (emotionally) untenable.

Onto the advice portion. I am partially aware of the situation regarding her condition. I know enough to say that she's dying. And given the way she's pushing herself, as well as trying to keep the whole thing secret from *everyone* excluding a few select cousins, and her aunt (yes, the secrecy includes her mother) for certain reasons, I am a bit hesitant to act against her wishes. I understand that this needs to be dealt with, and soon. 

So far, all I've been doing is collecting information on her hospital visits, why she's visiting, and what her status is for the day from one of her cousins (with her knowledge, of course). Should I get more involved than I already am? What can I do to ease my frustration?

Thing is, when we were at the conference, she mentioned that she liked a certain kind of sweets, that don't exist in the country she's living in now, but only in her homecountry and the countrys next to it (coincidentally, where I live).

Last time I came to visit my mum she said I look so beautiful and all her friends said so too and her friend wanted me to get with her son. 

I came to visit her after a month apart this week and I told her I met a new handsome guy and we might go on a date sometime and she said “Well if he’s handsome how has he been single all this time” and I said what do you mean? 
She said, “Well no what I mean is does he have the right intentions if he is that handsome.” 
And I said do you mean he could be too handsome? And she said “Yes, what’s he doing if he’s that handsome, it’s hard to believe he has good intentions for you. But maybe you can judge his character.” 

And at the moment I do look and feel run down and stressed and tired, I need a makeover and to pamper myself to look as good as I did earlier this year. I am moving house and I need to settle down in my new house to get back into my health and fitness regime and my makeup/hair/outfit to look as good as I was. 

And someone else was trying to set me up with another boy and my mum was like “well was he even interested in you?” I said he was attractive too, not as handsome as the other boy but still cute. 

And it just seemed like she found it hard to believe that any attractive guys would be interested in me at all. I am looking run down this week.

As an individual who cares about my personal information, infringements upon it, and who may be benefitting from it, is deleting my account the only possibility for protecting myself? (Obviously this would include removing the Facebook and Messenger apps from my phone). 

Or is there another solution? One where I do not segregate myself from my friends and family by isolating myself through the removal of Facebook from my life. Perhaps the removal of Facebook and messenger from my phone would be sufficient, leaving my account intact but only accessible through a pc? Or does this allow for other privacy violations? I remember reading an article several years ago which stated that Facebook had/has the ability to monitor all other activity on the pc while your signed in/their tab is open.

I do realize that the information they have gathered about me thus far is beyond my control or influence, but moving forward I would like to be able to make informed decisions or at least semi informed decisions about access to my personal information and how best to protect myself.

I’m the kind of person who doesn’t open up about my problems to people, I just deal with them. I’m lesbian but people I know irl don’t know that (or, I don’t tell them at least). Me and one of my few friends like to hang out sometimes and go to a cool bubble tea place near our houses, we call them “dates” for no reason than to be funny. About a week ago, my phone was bombarded with texts from people I don’t know telling me to never talk to my friend again, calling me a weird lesbian and telling me that I’m making my friend uncomfortable. I don’t normally pay attention to this kind of stuff but I decided to ask my friend about it. She said that this wasn’t true and that she knew that our “dates” weren’t romantic in any way. At the same time, though, her friends keep texting  me saying that she’s lying and that I’m a horrible person. At this point I start to think that my friend is just being nice and that she really just hates me, after all, this wouldn’t be the first time. Another day goes by and I tell my friend that her friends are harassing me with texts telling me to never talk to her again and she basically told me “they didn’t mean it.” At this point they have taken my already low self esteem and ran it into the ground, I’ve been missing activities I’ve been looking forward to because I’m scared that her friends will be there. When I tell my friend this and tell her that this isn’t ok, she just said there’s nothing I can do. The next day things get even worse, my friend and I agree that we shouldn’t talk to each other for the rest of the year and that “maybe we can text over the summer.” I thought that this would finally put an end to this but it didn’t. I have no clue how to stop this harassment, even if I block them I still get the texts on my computer. If anyone can help, that would be appreciated.

Sorry this was really just me venting.

Anyway I’m just happy it happened with someone I trust (she’s a close friend). 

The reason why it never happened before was basically I weighed 240 pounds (110 kilos) and was fat my whole childhood/early adulthood and in the past 2-3 years I got sick of it and lost 100 pounds (45 kilos); I’m about 145 pounds/65 kilos now, bought new classy clothes, grew a decently attractive beard and generally some girls at work even tell me I’m attractive, which I don’t want to believe because I think I still see myself as I always have, fat, gross, not horribly ugly but simply too blubby and definitely not boyfriend material. 

My friend who I kissed said that she was surprised by actually how natural and not forced it was, and the whole evening was actually super hot and she was really getting crazy. She knew it was my first time but she couldn’t let us fuck because she’s with someone else and I respect that.

My question is, am I a loser for being born in 1994 and only opening up/blooming now? I feel like I don’t really care but at the same time I feel like I need some closure; for the longest time I was in denial and insisted I don’t need a girlfriend because relationships and even just sex is complicated (to justify not having sex or even kissing anyone, the truth being I was overweight/obese and insecure). But now that I’m in good shape, idk maybe it’s the hormones or tesosterone but I feel like it’s natural and I need this. Maybe I’m just maturing (probably?). I think I’m just overthinking due to having a different mindset all my life. Not sure if I should be happy finally my life is changing for the better or depressed it took so long and I “wasted” so many years..

I'm a 20 year old male, my gf is soon to be 21. We found out about the pregnancy in May, and decided that we want to keep the baby. Both of us are extremely happy about that, and we are looking very forward to it. My mother's side of the family is very supportive, and very happy for us. So is my girlfriend's entire family, and it's been a huge help.

I'll try my best to keep this short, but I kind of need to vent a little bit about it as well I guess.. So please bear with me.

First off, I lived with my mother until I was 13, when I moved to my dad because I was a bit of a difficult teenager at the time. My mother though, has always been extremely loving, a great mother, and treated me like an individual. She always listened to my concerns, fears, opinions and I was always taken seriously no matter my age. I love her very much.

I told my dad about the pregnancy last. This is because I know him as a person, and I knew for sure he was not gonna be happy about it. I also recently found out after speaking to my girlfriend and her family about my situation at home growing up with my dad and my stepmom, that I was abused.

This is something that has been eye opening for me, as I always thought the way I was treated was normal. But I've always been verbally abused, getting yelled at all the time for nothing, being treated like I'm just a child all the time, even as an adult now. Decisions were taken for me, I was told, whatever I did, that it wasn't good enough, that I wasn't good enough and can't support myself at all doing anything myself. My father physically hit me twice when I was younger, and I was led to believe it was normal, being guilt tripped about ruining the family when I eventually told my teacher about it and my dad found out. Nothing came of it.

So, in short, I've lived in fear of my dad for years.  Never daring to stand up to him out of fear of what might happen, and it ruined my own self esteem. I moved in with my girlfriend a year ago, and it's been fantastic for me mentally.

So yeah, let me get to the point. I told my dad about it, he got furious as expected, yelling, telling me I fucked myself over. But after lots of supporting words from her family and my mother and grandparents on that side, I was confident this was the last straw, as I'm not letting anyone try to tell us what to do, especially regarding our child.

I remained calm the entire time I was speaking to him, telling him that I've been afraid of him for a long time, and that it's affected me a lot mentally how they treated me, verbally and physically. And he just called it bullshit. 

So I told him if you're gonna be like this, block my fucking number cause I'm done being told what to do. He called me a coward, and that I have one day to apologise for everything I said. And like hell I'm doing that, I think he should be the one apologising. So I blocked him, my stepmother, and I have no plans on contacting them again.

But I have two little brothers, aged 11 and 8. The oldest brother is depressed and suicidal, and he's just 11. I know a lot of it is because of the situation at home. And I feel so damn guilty about leaving them. I want to contact them somehow. I have my brothers snapchat, but I know what I say is gonna reach my dad and stepmom anyways. I also have no clue how to explain any of this to them.

I'm sorry for the long text. Any advice would be deeply appreciated as I'm concerned about them, and I don't want to lose them for good, even if I have no plans on contacting my dad there. I just want them to know it's not their fault.

Last friday and saturday (28th/29th of June) I had a final semester test I had to study for, which made up about 1/3 of my final grade. On the 24th and 25th (Monday and Tuesday), I stayed up until about 1 am (I usually go to sleep at 9pm or 10pm and wake up at 5am) to study. On Wednesday (26th), Thursday (27th)  and Friday (28th) I tried going to bed earlier (at about 8:30 pm) in order to relax a bit for the exam, but was not able to sleep well.

Despite my classes being over since last week (29th) and me having nothing to do in the meantime, I still haven't been able to get some propersleep since June 24th.

I'm not sure how many daily hours of sleep I've gotten recently. I feel constantly tired and numb; I have lost my will to exercise, eat or simply do anything; my skin started to break out; I now have really, _really_ dark circles; and my eyes (I'm not sure how to describe what I feel) hurt if I close them. 

I have attempted lots of things in order to get some better sleep: exercising half an hour before sleeping; sleeping in another room and another mattress; sleeping with more blankets and pillows; having some tea (passionfruit and chamomile); taking a hot shower; spending the entire day w/o using my phone, laptop and tv; trying the 4/7/8 technique; et cetera.

I'm 19(M) yrs old, youngest of 3, living in Australia. My brother (23) has been abusing drugs (Ice) for the past couple years. He doesn't really admit to it but we know that he's 100% on it. He regularly loses his job and disappears over weekends, making it difficult to contact him. When he eventually comes home he just crashes for hours (15 to 20+). My mum loves him dearly. He used to be a good kid but now hes just a complete and utter selfish piece of shit. 

My Father has lung cancer and was undergoing radiation treatment, but caught a fever after 2 weeks of daily radiation. The other night, he woke up from a nap late in the afternoon and could barely breathe so we rushed him to the hospital. He almost died that night because my mother and I were visiting my sister who just gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. He's staying in the ward at the moment, and he finds it hard to do any activities even if they're just mundane tasks, or his breathing suffers. 

His health doesn't look very good from and I need advice on what I should do to help my family should he pass away, particularly regarding my mother. My sister is amazing, and always ready to lend a hand when she can. She will probably take my mother in if my Father passes, leaving my brother on the street, which is probably for the best. I suggested kicking him out of the house multiple times but my parents could never kick him out of the house, as they are very loving parents. I think my father will make it through this sickness, but even so, he'll still be left looking after my useless brother (lost his license).

I live by myself 4 hours away by plane and I'm using my leave to visit them for 2 weeks. I want to know what I can do to help. What can I do about my brother? He's been abusing for years and my parents have tried their hardest to get him off the drugs but they're so easy to come by in my town he just gets back on it every time. His selfishness has put my family through so much stress the last couple years and I cant help but think I could've done more to help.

How do I wake my brother up?

Any advice would be appreciated. We've been dealing with this shit for too long. I know this isn't the most well structured question but at this point I am open to any advice about anything in the thread.

I actually don't want to seek revenge on her.  

I feel sorry for a person who has to live in a toxic environment like that who has to go on social media to seek attention.

While I'm enjoying my real life, she's on Twitter all the time making posts about me thinking it bothers me when it doesn't.

I've had to take time out of my day I don't have to respond to her and that's been proven to be a lost cause so I'm starting to ignore her now and I'm writing a book about her harassment instead of responding directly to her. She still pretends to be a victim claiming someone is gas lighting her but she never tells her followers who and they still believe she's being ""bothered.""

She claims she's ""happy"" with her husband and her 8 pets, but why then, does she go online all day to start drama with people? Doesn't seem like the actions of a ""happy"" person to me.

I'm really wanting to advise her to go seek a psychiatrist to see why she behaves the way she does.

Her vile and rude behavior does not bother me. In fact, I've been attempting to ignore her.  I know she's a miserable person and I'm not taking it personally what she's doing to me.  I'm just a target for her to unleash her anger out on me even though her anger has nothing to do with me at all.  

And none of her supporters care about her, either. They feed her ego and they fuel her drama instead of telling her she needs to seek some serious psychiatric help for why she lies all the time about herself and about other people and why does she self project her own bad behaviors onto other people.

She tries to hype herself up to be something she's not.

For example - she brags about being a full time author and she works from home when really that's just saying her husband pays for everything the kids, the house, the food, so that's why she doesn't have to work.  She acts like she does everything on her own when she needed her husband to pay for her and the kids so she can concentrate on her full time ""writing career.""

She just lies and exaggerates about herself all the time.  She needs some serious psychiatric help but won't get any help and she bothers the writing community with her drama when we're there to talk about writing and most of us couldn't care less about people's personal drama yet she keeps bringing it up.

I'm a 23 year old guy basically living at home again after college. Was supposed to be out by now, desperately want to leave, though I feel like I'm stuck and no decision I make will leave me feeling happy.

I'll start by saying that I hate Los Angeles. Like, haaaate it. Went twice this year to see if I could see myself living there, and I honestly couldn't. However, after talking to a bunch of people in the entertainment biz on LinkedIn, it seems that I have to move to LA if I'm serious about having a career in TV writing. 

I resigned myself to that, but knew I wouldn't feel comfortable moving across the country from NJ to LA all by myself. I had a friend living in LA that I didn't necessarily want to live with, but given how expensive living by yourself in the city is, figured it was the best course of action to move in with this friend. I let him know back in May that I'd be joining him out there. Two other friends of mine had been discussing a move to LA, and also agreed to be roommates. I offered one of my closest friends, who had gone through a traumatic ordeal that left his finances in shambles, a spot on the couch until he got his life back on track. So as of September, there were supposed to be five of us living together in LA, and the friend living out there was tasked with looking at houses and apartments for us.

Suddenly, he decides he doesn't want to live in LA anymore. He moves back to Pennsylvania with his parents and gets a job at a phone store, and has no intention of going back to LA, as he never really had a reason to be there in the first place (no creative pursuits). 

This is mostly fine with me and everyone else because, like I said, I didn't really want to live with this friend anyway. He's terrible with money and horribly immature. Finding a place will be harder, but not impossible. 

Then I get a call from the other two roommates, who tell me they need a few more months to get their finances back up, so we should postpone to move to January. I say fine, it's not like I had anything specific waiting for me out there, I can pursue my career just as well in January as I can in October. Then a few weeks later fifth roommate who was supposed to stay on the couch until he got back on his feet finds a job and an apartment in Philly. The two who called about needing to get their finances up have not been communicating very much at all about the move. I'm back to square one, possibly moving to LA by myself, which I absolutely cannot afford and really do not want to do. I know what type of person I am, and I know I would fail in LA by myself.

All the while, I've been in a relationship that became exclusive almost immediately, and we've been totally inseperable since the beginning of August. What was meant to be a fling that would likely end when I move to LA has turned into a fairly serious relationship. She and I recently went to New Orleans together for a few days, which for each of us was our first vacation with a significant other. We didn't even bicker and both absolutely fell in love with the city. The energy of New Orleans makes me feel like it's where I belong, or at least somewhere I could live, which is a feeling I didn't get even once in my trips to LA. In fact, I've been to 6 different major cities this year, and the only one I liked LA more than was Orlando.

To make matters worse (or better), I'm completely head over heels for this girl. Everything feels right, and I've never been happier. I can't exactly speak for her but she seems just as smitten, perhaps even more than me. The youth and speed of our relationship is obviously a bit of an eyebrow raiser, but like I said, something just feels right. I've been in a 4+ year relationship before and had plenty of flings, none have ever felt this good and immediately comfortable. I didn't and don't want to leave her behind because for the first time in my life I feel emotionally fulfilled.

So now I'm stuck trying to figure out what comes next in my life. I graduated college last year, basically forced myself out of my mentally exhausting job, collected unemployment for half the year and now am living off my savings account and some inheritance money. I've been trying to find freelance work for both writing and photography but haven't had any luck yet. I've been offered a few positions both in Philadelphia and near my parents' house, but I don't want to take up a full time position right now without knowing where I'm going next, and none of the positions being offered are necessarily things that I want to do (i.e. selling cars in a dealership, working as an administrative assistant for $15 an hour, etc). The LA plan has almost completely dissolved and now I'm not even sure if I want to do it anymore, despite still wanting to work in the industry. It has also occurred to me that I don't have nearly enough in my portfolio, or really any of the connections I'd need to seriously expect to find gainful employment in the entertainment industry, at least at this stage.

Which leaves me where I'm at now, asking for advice from strangers on how to untie this very convoluted knot I've gotten myself into. My girlfriend is set to go to grad school next year, and seems set on Austin, TX, although she's also considering New Orleans. If she chooses New Orleans I'd gladly move with her, though I'm not sure she'd welcome living with a partner, as she's stated before that she doesn't know if she could ever do it. I have lived with a partner before and know how to handle it. We haven't ever seriously discussed living together but she frequently makes half-jokes about how we should move in together and get a dog, etc. We looked at apartments in New Orleans on Zillow and fantasized about it a little.

I know it's probably short-sighted, even foolish, to abandon a long-term plan and life goal because of a new relationship. However, it seems like everything in the universe is screaming at me not to go just yet. I mean, LA is literally on fire right now. On one hand, I know she wouldn't want me not to go on account of her. On the other, she tenses up every time I even mention LA. Then I think of how dumb I'd feel if I stuck around just for her, only to have her leave me when she goes to grad school. I need to get out of my parents' house but I don't know where to go because I don't want to commit to a long-term lease or job. I could keep going with the flow, but I'm hemorrhaging money from my savings and feel listless and adrift living with my parents. If I move to LA, it's unlikely she joins, I'm probably completely alone, and I'm unhappy. If I stay around here, I still have her, but basically nothing else. If she decides to move to New Orleans for grad school and wants me to join, I'm not sure how I'll be able to resist changing course and putting my dreams on hold, but I'm also not sure what I'd do for a living down there. Every decision feels like a catch 22, and in the end, I just want to be happy and not feel like a failure.

I am 36 and basically a virgin. Becuase of my insecurities and fear I never really pursued girls since my early twenties. And my sexual experience was relegated to just a hand job and foreplay type stuff ( fingering, playing with boobs). I also haven't made out with a girl since my early 20s. Anyway long story short, I recently got a great job and have been getting in better shape, so my confidence and self esteem has risen quite a bit. 

So I met this girl, Mildred (26) and we hung out a few times smoking weed. And she came onto me one night, and normally I would chicken out and think of some excuse to stop a chick's advances at this point. But I still barely knew her and was like fuck it, what do I got to loose if I embarrass myself? So she ended up sucking my d and I finger banged her. And to my suprise, a couple days later she wanted to get together again and we fooled around agian. No actual sex or kissing (I didn't know how serious she wanted to be, like romantically, and kissing seems more intimate than sex to me and at that point an actual relationship wasn't something wanted). 

Becuase of life circumstances, I won't go into the details, she left town for a couple months (1 month in). Since then we have been talking on the phone everyday and even wrote each other a couple letters. We have fallen pretty hard for each other after talking so much. 

Now here is where the advice comes in. I am totally intimated by her sexually. She has tons more experience than my basically no experience. I am afraid that I won't be able to please her. I have also been intentionally obtuse about my sexual experiences becuase I am afraid she will be weirded out if she finds out that the couple times I messed around with her make up the majority of my sexual experience. 

What can I do to became more confident in bed when she returns to town? Any advice on how to be sure I please her? 

Also, last time we talked she tried to initiate phone sex. Luckily, I was in a public place so I had a good excuse not to engage. But I would like too, but I have never did that either. I have never even sexted. Any advice on that front?   

One more thing, she told me the last guy she dated was a bad kisser. And, well, I don't have much experience there either. So I am real nervous about making out too.

He informed me today, that last month, the landlord let him know we need to be gone so they can move someone else in and up the rent.

My dogs and I are screwed. I have zero friends and zero family to turn to. He is the only person I know. I don't know what to do.

I have been bestfriends with a girl that initiated our first convo together. We both are studying in the same school now. She is really smart and really touchy with me. 

A little bit about me: introvet , 1.9m and really muscullar (rugby lock)

Brief description on what we do:

She has invited me over to sleep and suggested to ""cuddle"" (i put my leg over her leg because she asked for it while we were napping). We study, eat together all the time. There were times where she would hold my hand and drag me to places. There was a period of time where i was depressed and she bought me $10 worth of goodies to cheer me up, even spending an evening after school with me just to check up on me.she was even angry with me once for not bringing her to my mum's restaurant ( that was like 6hrs ago after posting this) after finding out about it. She and I game, watch movies and do really nasty stuff (not sexual, like putting a booger on each other face or plucking my facial hair). I met her friends and family and they have been shipping me with her all the time even when she was around, but she wouldnt mind.

But here comes the problem. 

She been saying that she is lesbian or bi. i grown too attached to her to the point where i cannot tell whether it is a joke. There were even times where she hang out with other guys that got me really jealous ( she is really open and charasmatic and talks to many people). I developed really strong feelings for her and tbvh she is my motivation to work hard and gym. A text from her or a snap always get my heart pumping. Its been a year and i really want to confess my love to her but i m afraid i might destroy and hurt both of our feelings.

I just turned 22 and tonight I was sitting on the couch with my step dad (my mum and younger half brother were out) and my step dad comes over and asks if we’re still friends and I told him that we were.

He then leans in and gives me lots of hugs and kisses on the check and then leaves to go out. What is important to know is that:
1. This is one of the least affection people I know. Like we don’t talk a whole lot nor do we ever hug let alone anything else.
2. He did this last year when my mum and brother were overseas and I honestly felt like he was hitting on me. I felt very uncomfortable but ultimately didn’t tell anyone about it and until tonight, nothing similar has ever happened so I’ve always thought that I was reading way to much into it.

So yeah, he went off and I was at the house by myself and everything was okay. Then he comes back home and we were chatting and he sits down next to me and I could smell cigarette smoke on him so I told him to go brush his teeth otherwise my mum would know that he’s been smoking. Anyway he goes off and does that and then comes and stands behind me and gives me a hug. 

As he’s doing this, he starts putting his hands on my boobs and starts to rub them. He then starts to go to my bra and he asked if he could and all I did was shake my head. He kept asking me and all I could do was shake my head no. He then eventually stops and tells me not to tell my mum (which he did last time) and then tells me that he would love to spend the night with me and asks if he can. All I can do is shake my head no and he clarifies that he would only want to cuddle. 

He then said “okay well you’re mum will be home soon like so we better stop. Are we friends?” 

All I can do is nod my head yes. I sat still on that couch until my mum got home and I went straight to my room. I feel disgusting and dirty and I don’t want to be here. I want to go to my partners house but I know that if I leave here now my mother will ask where I’m going and will see me in my current state.

I want to tell my mum what happened. She doesn’t deserve to be with a man like that, my brother (who is 7) shouldn’t have that as a role model and I can’t be around him, but I can’t risk loosing my mother. She is my best friend and if she doesn’t believe me I’d be lost without her but I have to say something to her. But how? How do I tell her? What do I say? When do I say it? I can’t tell her on the weekend, I can’t do it while my brother is around, he needs to be at school. So how do I live between now and then?

Every story I hear about extraordinary scientists, writers and artists points out how they were either a genius or started very early on or had a brilliant idea at some point. I'm neither of these - although parents/teachers/professors have praised me for intelligence/giftedness (and an IQ test agrees if you care for that kind of numerical estimate), I don't feel like I'm particularly smart. There's so much to learn and know in the world and I barely know the tiniest fraction! I'm onto my second master's degree, likely to start a PhD soon, but don't feel that I've contributed anything substantial to the world yet. I write passionately, but my skills don't seem ""good enough"" to me and neither do my ideas. I hear people sing praises of the extraordinary genius of many scientists and great writers - and can't help but wonder if that's something I will always lack, that you can be quite good with practice but that the last step to making a great invention, writing a masterpiece or advancing science is always the spark of genius. And that it manifests early, that you have to be faster at everything than the rest. I have to study for my exams, have to read things two or three times to understand or memorize and I'm curious about everything but fear I can't ever do everything I want in life anyways. I read like crazy, research outside of my fields, teach myself skills that fascinate me (tried programming and physics recently!) but I don't know if that matters if I can never make a difference.

So - is there a way for someone who's not stupid but not one in a billion either, who loves learning and is curious but certainly not the brain the world was waiting for, to still uncover a bit more about how our world works, or to at least leave it behind with a new piece of art? Is the solution just ""practice"", or are there things that will still always be beyond me despite working hard?

I am a devote catholic and my future husband is an ex Jehovah’s Witness. His family is still very JW. 

From the beginning both side have been very open and honest. We are going to have a catholic ceremony at my church and his family was not going attend that part and just attend the reception. Yes, they were going to miss there son getting actually married but at least it was a compromise. I had set up a special time right after the ceremony to go take picture with them not at the church, I bought the mother a corsage, my fiancé and his mother had picked a tentative mother and son dance, I have set up the head table for his parents and my parents to sit with us.  

This whole time since December 2018 his family has been calling me and texting me asking me about the wedding and how everything was going, and I have been trying to keep them involved in everything as much as I can since they live about 4 hours away from us. So I have been telling them every update asking for advice sending them pictures of everything. We went down there 3 weeks ago to see them and when we left it was all hug’s and “we can’t wait to see you at the wedding” and “we will be there”. 

I come home from work yesterday and my fiancé sits me down and says his mother spoke with the “elders” of the JW church and they prayed about it and they decided not to come to the wedding. 

I am furious. First i feel like a fool and like I have been played this whole time. Then I remember what hypocritical bullshit this is because were they live they go to wedding reception all the time. His mother has shown me pictures and videos of her and her husband at wedding receptions before, so they can go to strangers receptions but not there own sons? My heart is in pain for myself and for my fiancé. Weddings are supposed to be about joining two family’s together and his is now refusing to even show up to just the party. 

My fiancé hates confrontation and is very upset but is of the mindset if they don’t wanna come o well it’s there choice “it’s just the way they are”. My first reaction is I want to speak up, I want to not be disrespectful but stick up for myself and at least tell the mom something like “ this is the first of many events that we are going to both need to compromise because of religion, I want you to please reconsider not coming, the hurt it would bring me if you didn’t come that scar would not heal for a long time and it will do great damage to our relationship” 

But now laying here in bed I am thinking do I even want them at the wedding, if they don’t even wanna be there do I want to beg them to be, do I wanna be vindictive and use this as an excuse to not have to compromise in the future, do I want this looming are they and aren’t they coming cloud now over my wedding? I could just shut my mouth no longer say a word to his mother or anyone else about anything, block them on social media, when they ask me about the wedding just not reply and go silent.

Sorry if it’s the wrong place. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a way. 

At uni years ago, I lived in a big house share at the top of the house. One night I was asleep and awoke to some noise coming into my room. It was the sound of one of my female flat mates that also lived on the top floor. She had just got home from a drunken night out. She was completely all over the place. She was whispering for me to wake up. I was still half asleep and expected her just to leave. Next thing I know I realised my blanket had been removed from on top of me. 

She had grabbed my penis and was attempting to give me a blow job. I pushed her away. She kept coming back and grabbing at my penis. She was quite forceful and aggressive and kept begging me to please let her suck me of. 

I was really grossed out by the situation. And by the fact that this girl always tried to give off an air of superiority of moral ethics over everyone else. And yet here she was trying to force herself on me sexually. I managed to get her off and out of my room. At which point a few minutes later I could hear her snoring loudly in her room which was across the hall. She snores extremely loudly. 

I never really thought about it much after. It was never mentioned. I was so embarrassed by what had happened. And I never knew whether she was too drunk to remember. Years have passed. We lost touch. She was very toxic and I distanced myself. Only to then discover she is now a leading female empowerment activist for refugees and minorities. And gives talks on all of this. It makes me sick to think of what she did to me. And here she is now talking out against the exact type of things she is guilty of trying to do herself. 

If a guy had done this to a girl at uni they would have been kicked out most likely. I can’t help but think if I had said anything no one would have believed me especially as it was a number of years ago now. But seeing her now trying to come across as this saviour of morality makes me feel nauseas. I feel frustrated that I still find it difficult to move on and just forget about it. I know if I ever confronted her maybe for some weird kind of closure or something, she would just deny it. 

I’m not sure how to feel about this and i think that’s why I’m writing. If I am over blowing feeling this way and I should just man up then please tell me.

We got into a fight about her because I was tired about the secrets. Him not wanting to talk about her, yet still talking *to* her, only makes me think that there are still feelings involved. He showed me their emails and he never once spoke to her about me unless prompted. She heard through mutual friends that he got a new gf and she asked him about it. He confirmed, she flipped her lid and didn't email him for a few weeks. Came back and apologized for not responding and that was it. Then he proceeded to never ever talk about me. If we did things together for the day or for the holiday, he would say what HE did and omitted me like I was never there. I told him that this made me very uncomfortable and that if he still has feelings for this woman he needed to be honest with himself and with me. He claims he has no feelings for her, etc., and says he will mention me to her more. Well, he kept his word and started mentioning me to her but now she's not responding to him again. He claims that she is just busy and I'm overreacting to the situation, but I really think that she is jealous and wants him back. I don't really like their relationship and am uncomfortable by it.

My mother gave up parental rights of me and my siblings (due to my biological father being abusive + drugs) when I was 6 years old. I then went into CPS, where I went from foster home to foster home. Eventually, at the age of 7,  a family that also had a sibling of mine, decided to take me in as well. I guess they liked me enough to keep me around until the age of 10, which is when they decided to adopt both of us.  

Shortly after, my adopted mom lost her childhood best friend, and she also started menopause. At the time, I was maybe 12 or so when her and I started to have a LOT of issues. Looking back at it now (as an elementary teacher and someone who has taken a lot of child development classes) I realized I suffered a lot of abuse from her. She was very mean to me, she would point out my imperfections and she never ever said nice things about me. Instead, she would point out that I had a zit, or say that I needed to lose weight, things like that. She also frequently called me a bitch and said I am disgusting. I would also like to point out the fact I was a teenager, so honestly, I probably did and said things that were mean too, but I NEVER called her names, and always tried to follow the rules she had laid out for me. 

 When I was 14, she threatened to give away her rights as my parent ""unadopt me"", so I actually ran away for a day. Instead of walking into the school, I waited until my adopted dad drove away so that I could go somewhere else. Since it was raining, I basically just stayed in a dumpster all day... I know, it's stupid, I was 14 though and scared at the thought of being abandoned again. Eventually, I came home. Police officers were there, and of course my adopted mom denied her ever saying that to me.

 That event caused a lot of issues with my parents, which is really sad because I am a HUGE people pleaser. I have always sought ways to show my adopted parents how grateful I am that they adopted me, I always wanted to make them happy and proud of me. I never did drugs, made straight A's, and I didn't even leave the house much as a teenager because my mom would say that me leaving her made her feel ""lonely"" and that she wanted me to stay home. 

At the age of 19, I came home from a long 13 hour shift and my dresser was knocked over. My adopted mother said that it wasn't clean enough, and that I needed to fix it right away. THAT was a HUGE game changer for our relationship. For the first time in my life, I unloaded on her. I called  her out for every wrongdoing I could imagine, (which included the fact she sold her wedding ring and went to go live with some guy she met online for a year back when I was 11 years old) . During this argument, my adopted mom was screaming at my adopted dad to come defend her. He didn't budge, and honestly, I believe it's because he knew I was in the right.  I couldn't take it anymore, so I packed up what I could and moved out to live with my boyfriend at the time. 

For an entire year, my adopted mother refused to speak to me. During this time, my adopted dad had to meet up with me at restaurants, or have me come to his work in order to visit him. I wasn't allowed to be at the house. After that year was up, my adopted mom decided to let me back into her life. I of course had to apologize for everything, she has never ever taken blame/said sorry to me for anything. 

A few years went by, and I felt like we had a better relationship, although it felt pretty artificial. I tried my best to never do anything that I knew would upset them, I brought them food and would try my best to make them happy. 

Let's fast forward to December of 2017 where I am 24 years old. I don't know if you guys have heard of the love languages, but I'm pretty sure hers is gift giving. Anyways, that's important because I told her that I didn't really care about the gifts, what I wanted was for us all to relax and just enjoy the holidays. I told her that the way she acts around the holiday season is hostile because she is so stressed, and that I didn't like it. I guess I was hoping for us to work on this, maybe make the holidays better, but NOPE. She told me to never talk to her again. I called her and my adopted dad nonstop for days, and neither of them answered. Eventually, she just blocked my number. After a few months, I quit calling my dad as much. Then, I just quit calling them. I figured ya know what, my mom did this before, so maybe she just needed another year of the silent treatment. I cried about it often and would ask others for advice, but nothing really helped. 

Because of this, they missed my graduation with a bachelor's degree. Even though I am the only child to have a degree (in their own family and  with my brother)  they didn't care because I chose to be a teacher. That was something my dad was always mad at me for. He wanted me to be a nurse, or something else that made ""real money"".  They continued to ignore me. In the fall of 2018, I sent them a card. I said sorry again, and updated them on my life. I told them that I loved and missed them (I moved to another state after college) they never responded to the card. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, just this last month, I finally had the opportunity (due to financial stress) to go back to my hometown. They didn't didn't answer the door. I then sat in my car and called my adopted dad maybe 6 times or so (I had a new number, so he didn't know it was me) he answered the phone, asking who it was. He told me that they are moving to another town and won't  be back for a week. He said that maybe I can see him when I plan on coming back in June. Throughout the conversation, I heard my adopted mom say things like ""don't tell her anything!!!"" in the background,she was very obviously upset he was talking to me. I told my adopted dad that I loved and missed them... maybe 8 times or so, and only said ""ok"" back to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that phone call, he never answered the phone again. I recently heard from a family friend that they want nothing to do with me or my brother. So, in short, they have decided to disown us. I have been having a very difficult time accepting this. I think back at the times I was in my room crying, looking at a picture of my biological mom, and my adopted mom would come storming in, ripping up the picture and telling me ""I'm your mom now,  get over her!"" just for her to disown me? Why would she do that to me? I don't understand it.  

The conclusion that I have come to is that they adopted us for the money. Apparently, in the state I'm from, that got about $500 per kid every month until we turned 18, along with big tax cuts. At the age of 18, my mom did buy me suitcases and told me I should think about moving out soon, so maybe it really was just for the money?  Maybe they tried to  be good people, and that's why they allowed me to be in their life a few years past the age of 18? Maybe they never loved me?

It's also important to note that my brother (the sibling they chose to adopt with me) has also felt this feeling of disconnection, as if they didn't really care much about us, or want to be close to us. Ex: Anytime I was super affectionate, they would act very weird about it and often turn it down and laugh it off, like it was weird or something to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My biological mother  (biological dad was murdered) and I have recently started talking a lot more than ever before, so it is nice to have a motherly figure, I really do love her, however I am still deeply hurt from the situation with my adopted parents. I recently realized that I  DO have a pretty great life, I just need to change my mindset in order to enjoy it more. I need to somehow accept the situation with my adopted parents, and learn to trust others again. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I accomplish this?  Should I just focus on my relationship with my biological mom now? How can I accept this abandonment?  I have always thought of my life as an adult with my adopted parents. I envisioned them being proud of me, and helping them in their old age. I didn't take a gap year during college like I wanted to for my adopted parents. I didn't go out and hang out with people as much because it made my adopted mom feel lonely. I didn't wear blue nail polish because my adopted dad hated it (he said it was slutty?lol what). I didn't do drugs, make bad grades, be disrespectful all the time, etc... I feel as if I did everything ""by the book"" in order to be a good daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I made my mistakes, but I have heard about way worse scenarios from my friends where their parents forgave them,, and the only thing I can think of is that they don't want me anymore and cannot accept my mistakes because I am their adopted daughter, not biological.  I guess the good thing about this is that the relationship I had with my adopted mother has always been very unhealthy, so it's probably best we don't communicate. 

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, sorry if me saying ""adopted mom/dad"" was a little much, I am working on disassociating the mom/dad title to them to the best of my abilities because it is helping me cope a little bit. A;lso, in case anyone asks, my adopted dad only yelled at me maybe 2 times and has always been understanding and nice, the polar opposite of my adopted mom.

They have two girls, aged 11 and 5, and a boy, aged 3. The girls are very close and seemed to have a great bond. They spend a lot of time together and wanted to go to their own room and watch a movie, which my aunt said was okay for them to do as their brother likes to watch “baby programmes and the girls don’t like that”. So I thought it was cool and I’d hang out downstairs with the kid. We watched back to back episodes of Peppa Pig, and about 45 minutes later I figured I’d go see how the girls were and if they were hungry yet. Even as I was heading upstairs I could hear their TV it was that loud. So I lightly knocked and opened their door and then quickly closed it as soon as I saw. They never noticed me open the door but I saw that they were naked, and one was on top of the other. I couldn’t see exactly what was going because of the way they were angled but I assume they were kissing or whatever. But I went downstairs and just yelled on them really loud and acted as normal as I could when they came downstairs a few minutes later. I didn’t let them go back up after dinner and put on a movie for us all to watch before their bedtimes.

Like fuck I don’t know what to do. Even when my aunt and uncle got home and asked how everything was I said it was okay but I really don’t know how to bring this up to my family. What if this messes my cousins up once they get older? Or they’re being abused by someone else? Or nobody believes me?

I dont have a degree, I cant afford to go back to school, and I would'nt even know what to do in school anyway (why I dropped out). I'm thankful for my retail experience and think I could be cut out for management somewhere some day BUT!!!!! I dont have my own car.

Last year, we worked on some special tasks and I was super nervous around her because she’s super pretty and I wanted to ask her out, but I felt like I was being gagged and couldn’t ask her out. Over the past year, rumors about her were being spread through out the company that and she went through a relationship that ended pretty bad. We ended up becoming partners and things were kinda rocky at the start. She ended up earning my trust and proved all the rumors were false. Over the the past couple of months, we became best friends. She really earned my trust after recognizing how I was truly depressed and pointed it out to me. 

We ended up being split up (according to the big wigs, its temporary) because I reclassified and need to go through training. One night we were texting because we couldn’t sleep. We started to flirt pretty hard and tried to give it a shot. She then ended up pulling back and said she needed to work on herself. Okay I understand, that relationship fucked her up pretty bad. Then a few weeks later we started flirting again, just to get pulled back again. Same reason. A few nights later, things got pretty explicit and it kinda stopped after that.

We still continue to talk because we’re besties and we finally began to hang outside of work. She was finally dating people so I thought I had a chance, but she kinda just blew it off. She ended up meeting a dude that set off so many red flags to me. Like it’s not a jealously thing, they are legit red flags. Dude is a felon out on probation for drug charges. He took awhile to bring this info too light. RF#1. Now he said that was a rough time in his life and he has corrected his ways. I don’t judge him for that really, but our job involves access to controlled substances so they both will be under a microscope by so many people. Especially since she accidentally made a few mistakes in logs. 

RF#2 is He has (or had. Its such a complicated situation that’s still developing) a fiancee that he never mentioned at all. He claims that he was gonna bring it up, but she found out when the fiancee called her asking who she was and all this. Then she heard him in the background with a yell and then the line went dead (RF#3).

RF#4 is now she’s been sucked into this hard because she’s head over heels about him and has ignored my advice to avoid the whole situation. He keeps saying this and that and it just lures her in more and more. She gave him the ultimatum to cut the fiancee off or lose her.

I’m so happy that she’s getting out there after her ex, but it scares the fuck out me of the situation she’s getting herself into. She has called me in the middle of the night or blown my phone up over this because it has caused her pain. She’s a really sweet girl and all. Seeing her get hurt just fucking kills me in so bad.

I was talking a mutual friend of ours about it all and the friend agrees that her and I would be a great couple and I just need to tell her how I feel. So I did. She said we have way too many differences (only thing I can really think of is religion and politics) and she’s just not comfortable with escalating our friendship into a relationship. That sucked, but I’m just rolling with it because I love having her as a friend. The friend said she’s just looking for love, which is great, but she’s looking in all the wrong places and not seeing what’s infront of her.

So now I’m stuck feeling super conflicted. I want her to be happy because I’m her best friend and I don’t want her to get sucked into something super bad, but I also just feel super shitty every time she talks about him because I’m here ready to treat her the way she actually deserves, but she just doesn’t see it that way.

I’m so lost. 

My husband and I have been together for 10 years,
Married for almost 7. We have two young kiddos who are my world. 

My husband was stuck in a stressful dead end job for a very long time. He was unhappy, stressed and looking for something else for a few years. This put a lot of stress on our relationship as well. After what seemed like forever, he finally found a new job and is extremely happy working there. He has been there for a couple months and it’s going amazingly well. 

I figured so much of our relationship problems were because of the junk he was dealing with at work. Even though he is much happier, it seems like the issues are still here. 

The only affection I ever seem to get is a quick peck when he runs out the door in the morning and then another when he gets home. He would randomly grab my ass or boobs, which I told him I hated and it made me feel cheap. Since I told him this he has stopped that. I told him I’d rather have him throw his arms around me and give me a hug, but that hardly seems to happen. 

Mothers Day was a huge let down. It left me feeling upset. Nothing felt special at all. He had a gift for me and it didn’t arrive in time. I told him that gifts don’t matter. I don’t want a gift, I’d rather do something special or a small gesture. My birthday is in two days and I’m already dreading it. He suggested that we go on a “date” just him and I, which is great cause it hardly ever happens but the thing he wants to do is something HE wants to do. He didn’t even ask me if it’s something I want to do. 

Every evening is the same routine. Once kids are in bed, all he wants to do is go downstairs and watch tv. Usually I’ll watch with him, half of the time it’s something I don’t even want to watch so I hardly pay attention. It starts to get late, so I head to bed and he usually stays up and watches more. By the time he comes to bed I’m fast asleep. 

I have told him my concerns and that I am not happy and things need to change. He said he will make changes, but it seems like nothing has changed. I just feel so lost and lonely. It’s almost to the point of where I don’t even want to spend time with him. I know I could try to be more affectionate or ask him to come to bed when I do, but honestly I feel so alone and unwanted that I don’t even want to put in any effort.

I’m currently on summer break. I’m 17 and about to be a senior in high school.

I’m also the oldest of four children.

My parents never taught me anything. When I wanted to learn how to do stuff, they just yelled at me because I didn’t know.

I learned to use a stove when I was 16, and this was from my 12 year old sister. My parents taught my sister how to use a stove, but not me. When I asked, they yelled at me. I’m very grateful she taught me, because now I can make myself breakfast in the mornings.

They also didn’t teach me how to ride a bike. My dad just yelled at me because I didn’t know how. However, my three younger siblings all learned how from my parents. I watched them all learn how to ride bikes and the smiles on their faces. The bonds they had with their parents.

Today, I really don’t know how to do anything. I have one year left of high school. When I get out, I’ll be hopeless. I don’t know how to order food or purchase stuff or move out. I feel like I’m stuck with a child’s mind because I still want to live my childhood. I want to live my childhood because I never had one. All I’ve known is abuse.

Backstory is that I liked her for like 5 years. I told her 5 years ago I liked her and she rejected me but we were always close friends then last year we went to bed together out of the blue we were both drunk and we stayed up talking where I said that I liked her for years and she told me afterwards it was a one time thing

It was painful to go through cause I came from a ‘angry’ family if you get my drift and so this was the first time I ever properly felt real love which for those of you who don’t know is like discovering a new emotion. Very painful to get over as Lucy knew about the stuff with my family and when I told her I was struggling to get over her she told me that it was the emotion that I was struggling with and not her (which wasn’t true) and I guess that I felt like she didn’t want to ever deal with it again. I felt tossed aside as I would go home and have this emotion that I couldn’t handle. 

Took me a while to get over it but then on my 19th birthday she kissed me in a friends house and then she took me to a bedroom and closed the door saying goodnight which was confusing as I felt like she put me to bed. 

I learnt from my previous mistake and told her that we should stop talking as I needed to focus on university exams, she accepted it and acted like she didn’t give a shit. One week later I get a text from Lucy asking if was going to kill my self. At this point I’m extremely confused and ask why she thought that. She says that she learnt in her psych major that people distance themselves before attempting suicide (at this point I’m getting close to the end of my fuse as I have had mental health issues like PTSD depression, in the past but i got a handle on them after my sister told me to man the fuck up). 

I ask her to come to my dorms where I tell her that I’m fine but I want to move on from that part of my life and then she tries to use her psych major to analyse my family relationships effect on my previous romantic relationships, 

I bite my tongue as I think it’s super rude that she think her psych major means she can tell me that my parents dysfunctional relationship has impacted my ability to form good relationships with girls, she verbally trampled on all those terrible years to then spell out that I’m fucked up as a result (I’m rly not btw my past relationships have always been great and ended with friendship with all my exes).

I have to stress how annoying this was, she says all the time that one of her favourite things about me is our ‘similar childhoods’ - our childhoods are not similar, she got depressed at 13 for a year and that’s it. 

I was beaten bloody at 11 by my father after I took some sweets that weren’t mine.

I was arrested at 13 for a family fight where I fought back after my dad punched my mom and I broke his nose with a head but. I spent the night in jail at 13. 

I slashed my wrists at 15 in suicide attempt and woke up in my own blood 3 hours later. No one had even come to my room in that time despite being in a big family. 

I hung my self at 17 and the belt snapped. Otherwise I would certainly be dead right now. I spent the next hour on the floor half awake half not. 

My point from this is that, I understand that she thinks we have similar backgrounds but in brutal reality check it’s clearly not so.

Returning to the earlier conversation in my dorm: 
I accidentally mention the kiss from my 21st and she tells me ‘we’re just friends

 I walked into that one and I promised myself that next time if she tried to kiss me again I would reject it and walk away as I knew that the damage to my self esteem would put me down for weeks. then at a uni dance the other night (were drunk) Lucy grabs my hand and pulls me close out of nowhere and leans close and asks me to be her last dance before she leaves. 

I pick up the signals and say ‘no I have to do something’ walking away. I don’t look back but when I’m outside having a cigarette 5 minutes later she walks out looking angry and doesn’t look at me despite me being in front of her. 

I just so happen to make out with her friend Clare that night after she leaves. It had nothing to do with her, Clare just happened to be into me. I later find out from a mutual friend that when she left she asked her group of friends if they thought anything would happen between Clare and I as everyone knew Clare was into me. They all said no and she went on. 

The next morning were at a uni function and we walk past Lucy and her friend, I avoid eye contact (lowkey not obvious) and they both look at me and laugh which all my friends happily point out was directed at me.

 later my mate who also kissed Clare after me, brags to Lucy that he kissed Clare then casually mentions that Clare kissed me. I walk up in the middle of this and Lucy asks me if it’s true, I said it is. 

Lucy says that she had ‘talked to Clare’ about this before the dance and so now I’m immediately picking up jealous vibes like she told Clare not to kiss me. I ask her to explain but she says she ‘obviously can’t’. 

I walk away with my mate and Lucy comes up to me and asks me not to have sex with Clare until the end of university in a few months. 

I’m shocked and say OK passively and later on my mate tells me that Lucy was getting irate about Clare to him, saying stuff like ‘fuck Clare for that’.

I presume that she asked me not to fuck Clare because she doesn’t want to get jealous before she moves on somewhere else after Uni. 

I’m absolutely annoyed right now, not only did Lucy reject me twice she fucked with my feelings (accidentally I guess) and she clearly has feelings as she didn’t want Clare kissing me but when I reject her and her friend kissed me, she suddenly wants to set boundaries for me. 

I feel like she just wants me to sit in the corner like a puppy until she wants to kiss me. I have to say that rejecting her was the best decision of my life, it kind of showed her true character. I watched her kiss loads of guys and Although it was painful I didn’t dare get involved, now she can’t handle this one thing. 

Any advice would be helpful, I’m at a party with her tomorrow night. I don’t know what to do, I accepted all of emotional shortcomings as my own fault, I never blamed her for any part of my inability to handle my emotions. I do feel like she has been leading me on when she gets drunk.

So my bf is 27 years old, I am 22 years old. I believe he has a serious problem with video game addiction and I honestly almost want to break up with him over it. I would have long ago if I didn’t care about him so much.

Before someone jumps in to comment that maybe he just enjoys them, I’m going to paint a picture of his current life for you:

He currently has no job. He is adamant that his goal in life is to become a popular twitch streamer and make a living from it. He even said something about staying on unemployment while pursuing twitch full time instead of getting a job (jokingly, but I think he was testing the waters with me). He plays video games for 9+ hours a day, every day. Even when he’s not streaming. He leaves bowls of food sitting on his desk, throws trash all over the floor and doesn’t really clean anything unless I tell him to before I come over. We can play video games for two hours straight and when I go over to his place he asks if I want to play games. Whenever he isn’t playing games he is constantly on his phone watching videos from YouTube “celebrities” who he idolizes because he thinks he can be them one day.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been supportive. I’ve helped get his twitch channel to where it is now (500 followers after over a year of full time streaming, so not amazing. Concurrent viewership is like 2-4 people and has pretty much been at a standstill for a while now). But I’m honestly sick of him prioritizing fake, meaningless shit over his own health and life, and also me. 

Is there someway that I can convince him to take it down a notch?? I don’t want to break up with him because I do love him but I’m honestly ready to if he can’t grow up and realize he has no job, no car, no skills, and no other interests outside of games. I don’t see how anyone can spend ALL DAY playing a game when you’re almost 30 and can’t even pay for your own food most of the time! He makes a little money from twitch, maybe like $50 a month. Instead of saving up for a car so he can actually hold a job he spent it all on weapon skins for a game.

So here we go.

I just broke up with my fiancee. We had been dating for six years, we actually had our anniversary. We met each other when she was still in high school, and I had just graduated. She had her own charm and personality that I really enjoyed. But quickly she began a gradual shift, resulting her interests resulting largely in her loving all the things I love. It was almost her personal identity began to mimic mine. I know people say that when your in a relationship that you begin to share the interests, but this was completely one sided. My interests didn't revert but she just went head first right into mine. Back then I was a bit more immature and I was psyched and didn't see this was even occurring. So first question here, is it a bad  thing this happened? Should I make an effort to never have this occur again?

So we spent alot of time together, it was great but after about three years she got, for lack of a better description mean. She just got really pessimistic, and insulting. It was to the point that my friends and family started to say stuff to me about it. I don't want to give off the wrong impression, I didn't just knuckle under and accept it, it was the subject of many fights between us. This aggressive behavior continued up until the end. Also it wasn't aggressive all the time, some times she was sweet, and funny, and I loved being around her at this time. But as time went on the amount of time she was like this diminished to the point it was a rarity. 

For the actual breakup, we at this point have both graduated from college, had long term plans for moving to another part of the country/world. But this just kept causing fights, and at this time I think I was more or less conditioned to it and didn't really even know how much we were fighting. Finally it got to the point we both realized we were not happy here. She kept saying that we love each other but don't like each other, I kept asserting that I did like her but not when she was more or less cruel. We mutually decided that we should split up but she couldn't move out yet so we began alternating sleeping on the couch. We were civil here, I told her I would help her any way I can, and I really do/did want her to just be happy. 

But during this week we were living together but broken up, she absolutely changed. It was she was the best of what anybody possibly could ever be. It made me feel inspired, courageous, and like I couldn't be troubled by anything. On day three we started to sleep together again. By day 6 I had to let her know, the person she was, what she I can see she could be, it was absolutely worth fighting for. And I meant it. I wanted this, I wanted her. So I told her exactly how I feel, and voiced my concerns about her descending back into the same behavior. We then decided to give ourselves a three month trial to see if we really could be the best for each other.

It lasted four days before she went back into the same behavior. I just couldn't believe the situation. I felt cheated by life, that someone could be so good but then just fucking suck so hard at other times. I wasn't fair that I couldn't be with her, the best of her. We talked again... 

This time around I was mad. I made it clear this was what was going on, and voiced my dissatisfaction. She said we grew up, and realized we didn't like the same things, that she wanted to be a different person. (She met some new friends through work that 'alcohol enthusiasts' and like going to bars all the time, and staying out until 3am). She wanted to party like a kid who was a freshman in college, and I've grown beyond that. I'm an adult, I don't want to an immature kid again, I worked very hard through college so I could have a good life, and not have to struggle. I worked hard for the both of us, supporting her through school so she could put her best foot forward, and then she wanted to tear it all down because she liked to go drinking, and partying with her new friends.    

I couldn't stand it, I told her I was leaving her. She moved into her friends how that night. She is still coming around, and moving the remainder of her stuff, plus she had some pets she can't take and I don't have the heart to force them out so she is coming over and taking care of them until a good home can be found. Do you think this is a good idea? Us being in such good contact, being civil, and trying to do things like this to make each others lives easier even though we broke up? 

As well do you think breaking up was even the right call? I love her I really fucking do. But how can I be happy with that kind of toxicity? 

Another thing I need to confess here. After we broke up I started talking to another girl I know. Shes cute, and funny. I'm pretty sure she is interested, but when weighing my options for my relationship, when I visualized her there. Not because I feel anything for her, but it was almost like I was planning my contingency. Is that a fucked up thing to do? 

Lastly I can't objectively define my own behavior and I'm sure she would paint a different story for this reason as well, but am I toxic here too? Or did I make her like that and not even realize it?

She's been smoking since she was 15 or 16 at least. At first it was socially, but it's been ramping up a lot, especially in the past year. 

She's gotten high before school, smoked while AT school, skipped school to go get high with her friends, all that kind of stuff. She's gone to parties and smoked stuff from people that she didn't know, gotten cross faded, and smoked in our backyard when weed was not legalized. The event that made me desperate was that she recently bought a dab pen that is scentless, so now she'll probably be high all the time. 

My sister has been very open about her adventures to my parents. She tells them stories of her partying, how getting high feels to her, and a LOT of intimate stuff that freaks me out. She tells me more than that because I've expressed an interest in smoking one day, but I'm waiting until I'm of legal age to do so. I haven't told my parents about the pen yet. 

My parents haven't really done much to stop her from smoking. The summer she smoked in our backyard they grounded her for a month, but that's about all they've done. They listen to her stories and express very little reactions, positive or negative. The most they've done in the past year is tell her she should wait to smoke until she's of age.

So I gave them my two weeks and after it passed- I left.

I should be happy. I have all the things I’ve wanted but for some reason it feels like I’ve accomplished nothing. I’m reminded by my friends and family that I should be happy and I should be proud of my accomplishments but it doesn’t feel that way to me.

- I am financially secure from starting and selling a company when I was 27
- I have a good paying and challenging job
- I own my own home
- I do not have a dysfunctional family
- I have a close knit group of friends for the past 20 years
- I am respected at work and in my industry
- I travel often
- I am relatively fit

The only thing I don’t have at the moment is a significant other - the last one I had was almost 2 years ago. 

I have all these things but I feel as though I have nothing. By society’s measures, I’ve “made it” and am living the “american dream” ... but I am like “now what?” The only thing all these steps got me is that I can live comfortably and buy random shit for temporary happiness and entertainment. My life doesn’t feel fulfilled at all and I do not know why. Any advice?

I worry a lot. Despite all the worrying I do, I still seem to ignore a lot of my problems. When I turned 18 last month, I realized I cannot push these problems in my closet like I do with the dirty clothes in my room. If I don't tackle these issues now, they will hurt me or the ones I care about.

Thanks to the help of my wonderful boyfriend, I realized I don't need to go to college right away like I thought I did. He also helped me realize I don't think I'm emotionally or financially ready to go to college. I have doubts about my major; I don't work well under stress, and there's pretty much no way I could pay for college (even a local, cheap community college) without taking out loans. With all this in mind, I think I will work and save money until I can better pay for college and have a better idea of what career I want to pursue. This is fine, but I still am worried about a lot.

What will I do if I never discover a career I want to pursue? How can I ensure I won't become out of practice academically and can't function when I go back to college? What if by the time I get all my stuff together, I'm old and don't have a lot of time to practice my profession? Scariest of all, what if I fail, disappoint everyone (including myself) and just become a loser?

Realistically, I know at least the last fear I is silly. I have loving, understanding family and friends and a loving, understanding boyfriend. I don't think any of them would call me or think of me as a loser, but I want to make them proud. I want to give back to them after all they've done for me.

I'm not a confident person and I don't like uncertainty, but uncertainty seems to make up a lot of what I have. So, my question is; how I can I practice my academic skills, help discover what career I want to pursue, and become more confident while out of school and working?

I denied it at first and told myself that I don’t actually like him I just like the idea of him. I did this to myself because when we first started talking he told me he was moving, not like to a different town but like a different country. So when I started realizing I had these feelings I didn’t want to believe it. I eventually went to my friends for advice and they said just go for it he’s going to be here for a few months so take your shot now while I have a couple of months with him. So I ended flirting with him a lot and he would flirt back and I could tell he started to like me back, we would always make fun of each other and then have deep conversations five minutes after. He was just one of those people I felt comfortable telling anything to. We have the same group of friends and I guess he’s told our mutual friends that he doesn’t want to lose me when he moves and stuff like that. I thought it was strange cause I thought we were just gonna keep in touch and stay friends. So now it’s at the point where he’s moving in less than a month, and one of my friends just recently told me that he was planning on asking me out the next time we hung out. My friends told me to try a long distance relationship and if it doesn’t work it doesn’t work. I’m afraid that if it doesn’t work i’m going to lose him for good and now i’m putting a pressure on myself that it has to work out. I’ve also thought of just telling him how I feel and how I don’t know if im ready for a long distance relationship, we’re still young so we still have our lives ahead of us. I’ve seen what long distance relationships can do to people and I really don’t want that to happen to me but at the same time this guy has made my life 100x better in the past few months. He’s honestly an amazing person and if he wasn’t moving I would say yes in a heartbeat, like he makes me feel so special and anytime I think about him I get major butterflies in my stomach.

I was dating this guy, super sweet, but older than me (he was 25) and we were intimate. He was the first person I was intimate with and I know I should have been more cautious. We were using condoms always and I was planning on getting birth control from my doctor at my next checkup. Anyways, my period was late this month so I took a pregnancy test. It came back positive so I called my bf and asked him to buy some more and come over. He did so long story short, the tests all say I'm pregnant. We live in a state with lots of planned parenthood clinics and I know it would be pretty easy for me to get an abortion. He really wants me to get one because he says babies are too expensive and we aren't married or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid to tell anyone else and if I get the abortion, I want to just get it over with and not tell anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always dreamed of being mom. My sister is way older than me and has two kids. I love playing with them and always wanted that for myself. I don't want to risk messing up my fertility or something over this stupid mistake I am now crying over.

Hey Reddit I'm having a problem. My childhood friend doesn't want to know me. We used to be joined at the hip, we did everything together. We were both very hard working and I was very proud of her when she got into one of the country's top law university. Everything was fine until she met this guy who sponged off his parents and had never worked for anything in his life. My friend became very isolated not just from me, but from all of her other friends apart from one. When it came for everyone to go off to university she decided not to go last minute and instead move in with her boyfriend and his parents. Since then, she hasn't worked or gone into further study, hasn't made an effort to contact her friends or family (apart from the ones who clearly like her boyfriend) and has adopted a snobby-like attitude towards people who are achieving things for themselves (was told by the only mutual friend who is still in contact with her that she mocked me for getting a year long internship at university) .
I've tried my best to stay in contact. I've asked her how she has been and attempted to meet up with her on several occasions. A couple of months ago I came to the conclusion that I shouldn't keep trying to do this when she is clearly not interested and after messaging her last night with the last of my messages being left on read, I knew I was correct.
I'm upset over the fact she has changed so much. We have so many memories together. We grew up together and I'm disappointed she has chosen her boyfriend over her friends, family and individuality. I know that people change and we can't stay friends with everyone forever but how do I get over this? I know I shouldn't do this but I do blame myself for what has happened- maybe I should've done something? Any useful advice is welcome.
TLDR: Childhood friend clearly doesn't want me in her life, how do I get over this?

Note: Due to multiple reasons, I know this person is not being abused by her boyfriend.",True,False,,False,Advice,t5_2qjdm,,126389.0,public,,self,,,How to get over losing a friend due to choosing different life paths?,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8s6lqa/how_to_get_over_losing_a_friend_due_to_choosing/,all_ads,6.0

We’ve lived together almost the whole time. Our sex life has kind of gone down the toilet and I don’t really know why. I’ve tried talking to her about it and it’s a really sensitive subject for her. 

She says that she lacks the confidence to feel sexy so she doesn’t want to. She also has a few other reasons, but it seems to be kind of like a one thing after another. 

I don’t want to do it with her if she isn’t feeling it, but my thing is she’s never feeling it. I thought maybe talking to her about it would help, and it does for a day or so and then we will go a couple weeks without doing it. 

Even when it does happen, it’s gotten kind of awkward. Sometimes it’s really good but she shuts her eyes really tight like she’s never done before. I just plain think she’s not attracted to me anymore but she says that’s not the case. In fact, she gets furious if I even kind of mention this stuff. 

I guess it might not be advice I’m looking for as much as “Do other people in a happy relationship go through this?”

We are attractive people in our mid 20’s and I feel like I should be posting in r/deadbedrooms. I know that we are both sexual people, so it confuses me. She watches plenty of porn when I’m not home, so I’ve asked if we need to do anything new to spice things up and she gets angry again.

We had made plans to move to another state with another roommate, NA, at the end of our current lease because we figured we’re young and might as well experience other cities before we all settle down.

About a month ago I held a house meeting and let my roommates know that I received a promotion at work and wanted to take it, therefore I’d be staying in our current city. I brought up the fact that I need to focus on my career and self-growth. NA was happy for me and told me she wanted to stay in the city and get a place with her boyfriend anyway. We asked KP what he might want to do and he said he’ll probably just find somewhere else to live. That was the end of it.

Ever since then he hasn’t talked to me. Every time I come home from work he gets up from the couch and goes straight to his room and closes his door. Sometimes all three of us will hang out at home but NA is basically the middle man and KP doesn’t direct any conversation toward me.

I know he’s upset that I suddenly changed the plans and decided to stay in the city because his ex (who cheated on him) told me. He’s a bi-polar psycho. He’s messaged me on numerous occasions calling me a f*g in one message, and then telling me how attractive he thinks I am in the next message. I’ve told KP about the nasty messages and let him know this guy that he’s STILL messing around with is emotionally unstable and is not a good person to be with. He ignored me and hasn’t had a conversation with me since.

We’ve been best friends for 10+ years so it’s hard for me to watch this friendship fade. But at the same time I don’t feel like I did anything wrong and should be the one to make any moves.

Long Story short. There was this girl I was seeing. We had some problems. She was giving me mixed signals. I talked to her, when her parents weren't home. I sat down with her, but she didn't want to talk. So after a short time of trying I left.

This story ist 2 years ago.

Now my aunt calls my mom and tells her, that this girls mother is talking shit about me. E.g. she is saying that i pressured her daughter, that she yelled at me and kicked me out. And some other things.

Normally I don't give a damn because I don't care nor about the girl neither about her mom. But now she ist involving my Family. Some of my aunts already know, and that means my whole family will.

Problem is I have no evidence for anything (neither does she). What you need to know is that my family is the kind that will always scold me.

I explained the truth to my aunt and she told me to talk to the mother. I called her 2 times she didn't respond.

I don't really know what to do. Should I confront her, or will that maybe make everything worse because I have no proof?

Please give me some advice.",True,False,[],False,Advice,t5_2qjdm,,315584.0,public,,self,,,She ist talking shit about me.,0.0,1569510828.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/d94o4h/she_ist_talking_shit_about_me/,no_ads,0.0

I vividly remember things like my dad chasing me down and as a kid and hitting me hard enough to leave marks so detailed you could see the creases in his fingers. The first time i realized what they were doing wasn’t right was when my sister (roughly 7 y/o) just had a buckle put in her eye for a detached retina (or some shit like that idk) and my dad holding her chicken armed up against the wall screaming at her that he was going to smack her if she kept “it” up. I panicked because they doctor had firmly told us to not jostle her around because she could go blind. I spoke up and told them I was going to call the cops if he smacked her and he went outside. 

Another time my mom turned her ring in and smacked my sister across her face because she said my mom was too drunk to drive us to our friends.

Episodes like this continued to unfold as I grew older. I feel like I don’t remember a lot of what happened because I repress memories of it. I feel like them telling me for so long that they weren’t doing anything bad make me think I was fabricating the idea of it all..

But along with it came with losing friends, school fees not being paid, doctors appointments not attended, etc. I had a lump in my breast (which later was found to be just growing breast tissue) the doctor urged my mom to get me more extensive testing and she refused stating I would be fine.

Hoping someone can offer advice or st least listen to me vent.  I’ll keep the story as short as possible.  

I’m married to a wonderful guy and we have an 8 year old daughter.  We both work outside the home, but I’m the breadwinner of the household. As he is in a mostly freelance business.  We’re both fine with this... it is what it is and typical for our professions.  Not super relevant, but provides a bit of perspective to our story. 

Recently, my father- in-law has fallen ill.  He has had heart issues for a while and is now in advanced heart failure.  He has recently had a LVAD surgery to extend his life as much as possible. ( for those of you not familiar, an LVAD is basically a pump typically given to those awaiting a heart transplant.  My FIL isn’t a candidate for a transplant, so this is the best they can do.)

My MIL also has some heart issues...she had a heart attack last fall but has since bern given a clean bill of health.  She also no longer drives.  (She can, just isn’t comfortable with it.). My in-laws are still married and live close to us.  My bro and sis in law live out of state, so most of the help my in laws need around the house falls on my husband. 

My FIL has been in the hospital for 3 weeks after his LVAD surgery.  Since MIL doesn’t drive, my husband also drives her back and forth from the hospital.  Between work, family and the new responsibility of being his parents’ caretaker, my husband is absolutely exhausted.  

It’s also important to mention that my husband has a great relationship with his father.  It pains both of us to see him having these health issues.  The MIL is a slightly different story.  She’s difficult, co-dependent and passive aggressive.  It was manageable at one point, but gotten increasingly difficult as she’s gotten older.  She also refuses to leave/sell their house and move into an assisted living facility or to even downsize to a smaller place.  Staying in their house is the only option in her mind.

Just today, my in-laws approached my husband with a plan for once my FIL gets released from the hospital...they will pay him to be their caretaker.  Which is fine in and of itself, but he would have to cut his projects/hours to do so.  The money they proposed isn’t bad...comparable to his freelance jobs, actually.  But the money isn’t the issue.  Im concerned with the emotional toll it would take on my husband.  He’s not professionally qualified to be a caretaker for a sick person., so Its not in my in- laws best interest either. Im also concerned that boundaries won’t be respected by his mother.  

As you can tell, I am very against this idea.  Mostly because of the reasons listed above, but for other reasons. 
 
I have voiced my concerns to my husband.  He understands but he thinks there might not be an option.  Am I a jerk for thinking this is a bad idea?  Has anyone else been in this situation and has advice on how to move forward?  I realize I might just need to let this play out and there’s not a lot I can do, but any advice is greatly appreciated!",True,False,,False,Advice,t5_2qjdm,,293808.0,public,,self,,,Hoping for advice on the care of aging in-laws,0.0,1564884994.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cldde8/hoping_for_advice_on_the_care_of_aging_inlaws/,no_ads,0.0

I know that. If someone is cute she’ll say they’re cute and if they’re not she will say so. My favourite bands, she comments on their appearances, “he’s cute, he’s got a nice smile, “ etc etc.

She used to call me pretty ALL the time. She called me other things - smart, determined, etc etc. But pretty was something she wanted me to know that I was.

Now the only thing I recall her saying about my appearance is that I was ‘fine looking’ (and not as in ‘ooooh he fiiine’ as in that’s fine, like that’s okay, basically she called me okay looking), that my boobs were bigger than hers now (which they’re not, I practically pass as male based off my chest and she does not), that I have a very very round face and that I am dead white, and look like ‘the moon.’ 

I also used to get catcalled at school. I don’t anymore. I’m only fourteen, I was getting called pretty and being catcalled less than a year ago.

I have body dysmorphia thanks to my Mom, she would always tell me that I’m not skinny and the year after she would look at pictures of me the previous year and go, “awww look at how skinny you were!!” She’d always comment on skinny girls, Taylor swift and such, and go, “god, wouldn’t you kill to look like her?” I remember being ten and wanting to lose weight so bad. I used to think I wouldn’t have to worry about gaining weight during puberty because I was so fat anyway. 

Basically my mom raised me to think that skinny was good, and I wasn’t skinny. I might have been a fat ass bitch but I was still pretty. Now I’m fucking neither and I am really sad over it all. 

My mom is a recovered anorexic btw. I’m not anorexic but my body issues make life shitty and I know, when I have kids, I am not going to talk about weight to them.

Just thought I’d see what advice you guys had for me. In late December, my now ex dumped me, so she could go back to the guy she dated before me. Main problem at the moment is that she’s in my major and I have to see her daily in classes (small major (physics) at a big college, about 140 kids in the major out of a  20,000 student population), which is the same thing that caused the stress last month that lead me to attempt to take my own life. 

Doing a lot better with self esteem and value though, learning to love myself! Just not sure what I want to do with my life anymore. I was set on going to grad school and following the academia route to becoming a professor, but not sure if that’s what I want anymore. I know I want to finish my bachelors, but not sure what I should plan to do after that. 

Part of me just wants to travel and adventure across the US, taking odd jobs and just living for a while. But also if I eventually decide I want to get back into academia, I’m guessing it will be difficult because research and scientific discoveries could make my knowledge fairly useless.

Any thoughts on what I should do with my life?

I know of the people he's investigating, a well known pair of twins. Conmen, non violent, I'll call them the twins for the sake of simplicity.

Long story short: For the life of me I couldn't find this PI I need to keep tabs on. After a few days I was assured by my client that the PI was consistently on location because he's been sending photos of the twins on a regular basis. *In hindsight that's pretty odd as the twins have done nothing worth noting or capturing since I arrived, so to keep sending pictures would be a pointless waste of everyone's time.*

Also, it's worth noting that my client never wanted to meet in person.

After a week and a half, I asked my client to send me some photos the PI had sent him so that I could get to grips with his location, it was a bit embarrassing and a blow to the ego but my only option left to find this PI.

**Where was his location?**

**My car**

**The PI had taken photos of the twins from inside my car, sitting in the drivers seat.** This guy's f\*\*\*ing with me, He knew I was there the first day I arrived, I know that because the progress of the building work in the background matches my first day there. I always leave my car for a portion of the day in this type of work (food, coffee, shit etc) not to mention the police tend to get called about “a suspicious man in a car” and blow things out the water, so to speak. He must have entered at those times, but this isn't even the worst part.

Roll back two days before hand: One night, sick of sleeping in a car seat after realising I was getting nowhere, I stayed in a grotty old dump of a hotel that had reasonable view of the twins so I could safely presume the PI would be close by and I wouldn't miss anything. I only stayed one night, it was worse than sleeping in my car.

All the photos my client sent me were taken from my car. All except **the one from the window of my hotel room... With me in shot... While I'm shutting the door leaving. Meaning he would have been in the room with me, and must have entered while I was asleep.** It gets worse.

Last night I found a note in my pocket:

&gt;*“He clocked you the moment you arrived*  
&gt;  
&gt;*under no circumstances should you open the boot of your car*  
&gt;  
&gt;*You've entered a game you know nothing about*  
&gt;  
&gt;*you cannot simply leave, you'll need to speak with us*  
&gt;  
&gt;*T.H.B”*

T.H.B are the initials of the twins which I haven't actually seen since I slept in that grot hole of a hotel. Their caravan hasn't moved.

Normally, I wouldn't worry myself in this type of situation but the pictures, along with the boot comment, have me in a panic and I make it a point not to make decisions based on panic. I haven't slept all night so my judgement is even more clouded right now, either this is genuinely from the twins, or I'm being played further.

Either way I'm cornered and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to continue as if nothing happened except I can't bring myself to leave the car. I need to make a decision soon. I have my suspicions about what's going on, but I want to know how others perceive this as clear headed outsiders of the situation before I taint it with my own logic.

So, let’s begin. I can never express my actual feeling to people that I love/that love me. I’m a pathological liar and spend a lot of time just thinking to myself what I want to say, but never actually end up saying. 
I believe that this should be contributed to my rough childhood. Our dad left us, mom is an alcoholic, and my older brother used to be abusive. Because of that I always feared saying something wrong to anger my brother. I never liked showing off things that I worked on (like drawings and such) or liked, to essentially my only friend (my brother) until I was old enough to go to school. 
I still to this day lie on a daily basis and never express my deepest fears and feeling to anyone that I actually care about and just vent in to the abyss, just like I’m doing right now, but this time I’m actually seeking help.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in an apartment building just off of my campus. The floor in my room is *very creaky* and unstable. The apartment building is on a hill and its not level. The walls and floors are thin as well, It's very easy for noise to spread. The weekend of the superbowl was a nightmare for me. 

 I got up to go to the bathroom about 10 minutes ago and I guess when I jumped off of my bed  I guess I made too much noise. 

My bed is *very* high off the floor, the apartment was fully furnished and I wasn't allowed to change the height of the bed in my lease). While I was in the ensuite, I heard a thump coming from the floor under mine, like someone was banging on the ceiling with a broom. I then heard ""*Whoever you are, stop waking me up in the middle of the night!*""

&amp;#x200B;

I practically crawled back to my bed.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle with anxiety and I don't know how to feel or what I should do. I don't mean to wake him/her up, but it's not uncommon for me to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I also do exercises (physical like jumping jacks) in my room (every morning and night)  because I get uncomfortable and self conscious at the gyms at in the apt. building/main campus.  If they can hear me get off my bed, they can hear everything. And this is the first time they've responded, I worry that they've heard everything (especially me exercising) and have been pissed at me for this entire year.

&amp;#x200B;

 I want to talk to my landlord because the floor is very strange, unevenly carpeted and thin and  that's not my fault. But is also is (?)

 I was thinking maybe I should get a rug to stop the noise from getting to the person.

I also was thinking I should leave a post it or something on their door apologizing for the constant noise every day because I don't want to be one of those obnoxious people who thinks the world revolves around them.

The job is to become a reporter with a major news outlet in a small northern town with roughly 3500 people. It seems remote - there is not a lot to do, but the region I would be living in is very diverse both with people and the types of content I can be creating. It pays really well too (almost twice what I currently make), plus provides a car and a big subsidy on rent. There’s also some money given to you as a per diem to offset the expensive costs of food and internet in a northern remote community. It’s also big for my career - I would be the only person for 1,000 km in any direction and that’s important for my field to get on national shows etc. It’s also pretty in line with what I want my career to look like in the future. 

The downsides though are pretty extreme. It’s cold for a good chunk of the year (read -45 Celsius and below sometimes). It can be isolating and there can be issues with internet connectivity, cell phone, and there’s no one for miles if you get into an accident on the road. It’s also a town with a very transient population - so if you make a lot of friends they leave often to bigger places and markets. It’s also hard to travel - flights are expensive in and out of the community and the nearest major city is at least 6 hours away in any direction. 

The alternative is to stay in this big city with a decent job, but not something I love. I still live with my parents because I will not be able to afford utilities if I move out on my own, but I’m starting to build recognition and connections here that is also valuable for my career. There is also the possibility of more job options in this city if I stick around because it has a really healthy job market and possible advancements for young people. Plus, my friends and family are living in town and it would be nice to be near them. I also enjoy being out and about - going to drinks, shows, movie nights with friends that I might not be able to do in this small northern town if I take the job.

I am 27 years old and I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years about 7 months ago because I found out he was cheating on me. I am still living with him due to financial problems and mental problems but I know I can't forever. He was my only true close friend and we are still 'friends' in a weird way but definitely not that close anymore and don't hang out or talk much, we keep to ourselves more when we are home together. I have some other friends but no one that I feel that close too, and they all have significant others. I am mainly close to my parents who I am thankful for.
I am mainly living with my ex still because the rent is cheap, only 250 for the each of us and I am used to living with him, and am scared of losing contact with him, but I know I will eventually. I work at a vet hospital as a kennel technican and get paid $10 a hour 35 hours a week or less. I really enjoy my job and working with animals but I am worried I won't be able to support myself independently. I live an hour away from my parents and they are really the only close people I have in my life. I am a big introvert and a quiet person so it's hard for me to make close relationships. I have met a few other guys after breaking up with my ex but haven't been able to have a great relationship with them, mainly sex.

I know I need to change something soon because I have been very depressed and feeling a lone and lost. Should I move back in with my parents for a while with their support and find a better paying job and save up and move out later on, try to find another place to live with someone else that I can afford with my current job, or find another job that pays better and try living in the same area? I like the area I live in now but I wish I was closer to my parents and it could be good to get further away from my ex. I know I sound helpless but I am feeling that way. Any sweet advice is appreciated

Anyway when we were about 12 years old, I realized I was gay and had a huge crush on my best friend. I realized I had always had a crush on her, and this scared me because I was always told growing up that being gay was a horrible sin. So I was mortified if I told her, or anyone that I would be hated. Looking back when we were young teens,14 years old she might have had a thing for me too. We cuddled a lot, she would put her feet in my lap, and we would sometimes flirt lol. But I could never tell if she actually was in to me. and being an awkward 14 year old, I didn't know what to do. In high school we drifted apart, and didn't talk as much. Flash forward to now, I always have wondered did I miss my shot? We're still friends on social media, and she always likes my posts and will comment on instagram. But we haven't really messaged or talked in years. Do you think I should message her out of the blue?

The next day I woke up with no pants on, was sore and bleeding, and he was next to me).
I asked him that day what had happened and he said that he has 'tried to kiss me and things but stopped since I was too drunk', no mentioning of anything else happening. I went to a rape crisis centre, they found tears etc and basically I struggled to come to terms with it since I didn't have proper closure.

A few weeks ago I finally told my best friend my suspicions (don't nag me that I should have told her sooner, I probably should have but it was hard) and she was devastated, she went to confront him and he ADMITTED to doing stuff to me, but tried to claim it was 'consensual' (then quickly backed down after my friend brought up what he had said to me). He denied having sex with me, however. Basically, my friend was upset and I tried to be supportive but struggled, especially when I found out she was still in contact with him. Anyway, we moved past that and they split up, but then a week ago she rang me up to basically say that she didn't believe me and that she thinks it was just a 'drunken mistake' and that I'm lying to try and cover my back. She is also friends with him still.

Now, bare in mind that this whole incident has now gotten round the entirety of my sixth form (we are all 17-18, I'm 18 myself) and the vast majority believe me, yet she can't. I've played all my cards with her; she was there when he basically admitted to it and couldn't get his story straight, she's seen videos people have of me where I couldn't even stay awake properly on the night, she's been there when I've cried about it, the whole lot. This isn't me trying to 'cover my back'; I wouldn't have gone to a rape/sexual assault crisis centre, I wouldn't have started going to counselling or anything like that if it was just a 'mistake'.

I've gone beyond the point of being angry about it with her, and she's completely isolated herself from me and our friends. None of them want much to do with her anymore either, but I considered her my closest friend for 12 years and I'm really struggling to come to terms with her accusing me of this. We have talked in person about it and she seems to have been brainwashed by him, she hasn't even got any reasons to not believe me according to her, she just doesn't believe he is 'capable' of it (bare in mind another girl has accused him of rape before this, plus someone else has also accused him of sexual harassment, which I found out recently).

I don't think I could ever fully work it out with her but should I completely wash my hands of her? Or should I try and sort things out, somehow?

I’ve struggled with severe depression, social isolation, loneliness, anxiety etc since basically middle school. 

Had a child at age 19 with a very abusive boyfriend, he left when I told him and I didn’t speak to anyone except my mom for 13 entire months (pregnancy and newborn stage). Lived at home with parents who are very mean. I was desperate for socialization and companionship, so got back together with child’s father. He was still abusive/Cheating and we ended our relationship after a suicide attempt by me, and him punching me in the face several times soon after. 
He disappeared from our lives. 

Met a great guy this year in February 2018. He’s Indian, so parents that probably would’ve never approved of me. We discussed this in the beginning and wavered on our decision to date. He finally came to me and said he’d choose us and live his own life etc. Since then my son and I have basically lived with him, he encouraged me to get an amazing job, I’m really doing well for myself, my mental health is the best it’s been in years. He helps with my son, babysits, takes him to school, daycare knows him as “Dad”. I signed up for 4 college classes while working 40 hours a week as an accountant because he offered to help as much as physically possible. He calls himself my sons dad. Fast but I can honestly say we are the same person, and made for each other. 

So the suicide. Totally, and completely out of character for him. He’s very mature, educated, has a great career and life outgoing type of man. He drank too much on Labor Day, left a note in his apartment saying “I’m sorry for anyone this hurts. Love you all goodbye” beside his cell phone. I came to spend the night with him and that’s when I found the note and his phone, but not him. I immediately called his brother, whom I’ve never met. He, in turn, called their parents, who showed up at his apartment where I was alone with my son, crying my eyes out. 

This was the worst possible way I could’ve met them, but they said they were thankful I called. They got boyfriend to return home and he said he’d explain later. He went to their house Tuesday night and they forbid him from being with me. They said they’d make sure themselves and the entire extended family cut him off and never acknowledged him. 

Boyfriend took all of this very seriously, despite it being a known scare tactic of Indian parents, and usually false. He is saying his “mind is made up” and he’s choosing them because it’s “everyone he knows” and he thinks he will be such a disappointment. 

But.... now I’m lost. My son has lost TWO fathers this year and he’s not a tiny baby. We were planning to buy a home in January, we have an expensive vacation planned for November. We were gonna give my son a family Christmas. Now I’m just... stuck at home. Completely isolated with my very mean, abusive, aggressive borderline personality mother. My mother turns my son against me and tells him that she’s his “mom” and that I’m no fun. No plans, no friends, no boyfriend, no help with my child that hates me, nothing. Dating is the furthest thing from my mind, and with 4 classes, work, and a child I have ZERO time to hardly even make friends online, much less real ones. 

Is there any way to talk to him about his parents? Any Indian people to chime in to help? How do I get out of this unscathed if I have to lose him?

I currently have 2 friends who are constantly harassed by one girl who has made it a point to ruin peoples lives. One is an ex friend of hers. She has her followers call him a pedophile and continue to do so. He has once tried to take his own life because of this.

My other friend was actually on the news. She won her kids back from their abusive father and now this girl is trying to ruin the kids lives by calling CPS with false claims and constant harassment.

I have written letters to YouTube and Twitter about this girl, but I feel they do not take this seriously. As I type this, this girl has announced that she will be doxxing her own family (whom she hasnt contacted for years) for her followers to harass.

I am at my wits end. How do we combat something like this?

But l just can’t shake the weird feelings I have about this. Please tell me if I’m being over dramatic.

My husband has a big heart, and has been saying since last Christmas that since he has no children yet, he’d love to buy gifts for a little girl he knows whose being raised by a single mom. My heart was so full of pride at the time, he’s such a good man. 

A few months later, I was looking at his Snapchat (with his permission, it’s a long story) and I see he had messaged a beautiful girl I’d never seen before “you have a nice smile 🤗”  in response to a selfie she’d posted. I admit I got more than a little jealous and started asking who she was. He told me that she was the single mom he’d wanted to buy gifts for. Now, about 6 months later, he asked me if I would mind if he asks her to get lunch with him this week. I said yes, but I wondered why. He said he wanted to get to know her before Christmas so it wouldn’t he awkward when he takes her and her daughter shopping. Obviously I feel he is trying to do a good thing, and I definitely don’t want to get in the way of him giving a little girl a good Christmas, but it just seems weird to me that he would feel the need to go this far. I asked if I was going to be included in the shopping trip (it is my money too after all), and it was clear he had not really expected me to go, although he said he didn’t mind. I asked in that case couldn’t I go to lunch with you two as well, and he got frustrated and told me that would be weird. He said it would make it look like he couldn’t go anywhere without his wife tagging along. I don’t see why it would be weird if we were both planning on gifting her daughter, and why WOULDN’T I want to be a part of that? What’s wrong with introducing us, I mean, wouldn’t most people expect a married man to bring his wife to meet his friends? It’s so strange to me, and the fact that she is extremely beautiful and he has told me he thinks she’s pretty makes me feel so uncomfortable.

She asked me for medical updates constantly, messaged me at all hours demanding news, blamed me for his illness (not possible) and a host of other things.  All while I was working full time, doing my best to keep our finances under control, taking care of our teen, the dog and my husband’s medical care.  He came home to live with us after a brief stint in rehab after six months of living with this trauma daily.  She came to visit to help “take care of him” by making his meals when I was at work and being here to let his home health medical team into the house.  She promised to be here for 2 weeks while I learned how to make life normal.  After a week of random strange behavior, she exploded on me one evening - told me things that i wouldn’t be able to say out loud to an enemy - let alone a family member.  The teen jumped in to tell her not to talk to me like that and then shit got super cray.  We actually rigged the hallway with a booby trap in case she tried to attack us in our sleep that night.  She ended up flying home early the next day leaving us to try and figure out food and how to let people in when I had work and the teen had class.  
I’m having a great deal of trouble forgiving her for what she did.  She’s demanding forgiveness.  She fucked with me and hurt me and hurt my entire family during the hardest time I’ve ever experienced in my lifetime.  

How did you find it in yourself to forgive someone who didn’t deserve it and let them back into your life for the sake of others?  She’s not MY mother - but I don’t really have a solid relationship with my mother either - different story completely.

First off, I just want to say thank you for all the different advice and perspectives from everyone. 

I talked to my fiance about my concerns and doubts and ugly cried, the whole thing. And he understood, and told me that it's my decision and whatever I decided, he would support me. Ordered wings and cried while eating wings and looked insane. But I asked him if he could come with me to doctor's appointments to see if I have any options when I came to staying mentally healthy, he agreed!

Going to therapy today was really needed because it ends up, I have a lot of trauma. Well knew that, but not trauma that was expected because apparently I like to ignore my feelings and its something I need to work out so I don't end of going on reddit and losing my shit. But today was a great day, the therapist, the husband, the work, everything, it was so great and so reassuring. Also, another factor I could of considered if that even though I'm not sure of the mom I want to be, but am definitely sure of the mom I didnt want to be. My mother and father were extremely abusive with their own skeletons in the closet, my mother never got any mental help and my dad was normal up to a cartian point. But found out that being locked in the garage overnight as kid isn't normal, and watching your parents throw vases is also, not normal. So that's good. I am proud of the progress I've made as a person, especially because I now have a relationship to be proud of where our fights don't even consist of name calling. I've heard my husband/fiance cuss out other people, he's heard me do the same but we've never yelled at each other. And ends up, when someone rear ends your car is a good time to call people a ""bitch."" I love my life, I love my job, my pets, my husband, my home.

First off, she has a girlfriend. And I really don't feel good about whether making someone cheat or breaking up. Either way I think it sucks morally.

Secondly -and maybe it will sound weird- but as much as I'm attracted to her, I don't really find her beautiful. So I'm kinda scared that even if anyhow it could work, down the road this could be a major issue.

Today, a co-worker made a remark about us liking each other, as in liking ""liking"" each other. Another co-worker agreed. Another one said nothing. As neither of us is out, it sucks. And it double sucks because I didn't want to come out and words go fast where I work, so I'm sure everyone will hear about it.

She told me that this girl asked her to work for her, opening the door for people and letting her ""do the rest"". 

A little backstory: my sister has had a rough time growing up. Our parents had an ugly divorce when she was little, and our dad was horribly manipulative. He would shower her in gifts, then tell her she was trying to ruin his life and ignore her for months. She had to deal with years of emotional abuse from him (and his shitty girlfriend) which all came to a head when he rejected her on his deathbed. My mom feels guilty about leaving my dad; she thinks his treatment of my sister is due to her ending the relationship, and babies her because shes worried about her mental health. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've tried being strict, having an open conversation, and nothing gets through to her. I hoped that she would be able to work through things, but it's gotten to the point that I have to intervene. I'm considering speaking with law enforcement, and asking for advise. My worry is that getting the law involved could make things worse. Here's how I see it playing out: 

&amp;#x200B;

I speak to the police and: 

1- she ends up in trouble, and is 'scared straight'

2- she ends up in trouble, and gets worse

3- any colourful characters that she's involved with think she ratted them out, which puts her and possibly my family in danger (I wouldn't be surprised if she's involved with gang members)

&amp;#x200B;

I stay quiet and: 

1- this is all a horrible phase that she ends up working through down the road

2- she remains involved in drugs and prostitution 

&amp;#x200B;

I know my mom will stick by her, and ruin her life trying to protect her, so I feel the responsibility to do something. I'm looking for advice from people who have been my sister, or know someone who went through something similar. 

Do I turn my sister in, or wait it out and hope that things get better? I know by acting, I risk ruining my relationship with her and my mom, but it's worth it if it results in her turning things around.

I have no idea what to do, nobody around me has any idea what to do. I'm 18 years old and I currently live with my older brother.

Those are much harder to find, especially entry position with no office experience. Not impossible, but there's no way I'm going to be able to find anything in a month. 

There's nobody who can take me in. My parents and extended family are long out of the picture. The only people I really have in my life are my two brothers, and neither of them can really help me.

It's not just the average ""oh I'll take another half hour to relax before starting work"" kind of lazy. It's like, I can't even be bothered to complete the most basic tasks. My bedroom has trash on the floor because I drop something and it's too much effort to pick it up; I say I'll just do it later and I never do. If it's not the night before an assignment is due I cannot start it, and if it won't negatively impact my grade if I neglect it, I can't do it at all. 

It's not that I don't care. I do. The problem is that tasks take SO much out of me. For example, I just sent an email to my professor about an assignment, and now I need to unload the dishwasher. Just writing that email took up all my energy. Thinking about unloading the dishwasher makes me want to scream or cry in frustration. I just don't have the stamina. 

I remember when I was a kid I would just have a complete sobbing meltdown over two worksheets I had to do. That was okay when I was 9 years old. I got through all of high school and one year of college like that--getting overwhelmed, being unable to will myself to do things, and just doing the bare minimum. Could I get through the rest of this year like that? Probably. But I just know that there is going to come a point where it just won't work anymore, and then I'll be truly screwed. I want to be able to get through an 8 hour day (of productivity, not 8 hours of screwing around on my phone) and not be too wiped to come home and prepare a meal. 

I'm feeling really discouraged. It's not that I don't believe in myself, or that I'm depressed, or that I don't care. I like who I am and I'm happy, and I have a bright vision of the future. There's just a constant wall, like writer's block but for my entire life. And nothing I've ever tried has been enough to overcome it. What can I do? 

TL;DR: Even the simplest tasks exhaust me. I've gotten through my whole life having no stamina for tasks and responsibilities, but I know that lifestyle won't be sustainable once I get into upper level classes/the workforce.

I take Honors and AP classes, and my dream school is UC Berkeley. I try to be nice to everyone, including my bullies. Though sometimes, I know when I have to be bold and stern. Also, I want to be a biochemist, while doing acting and dancing on the side.

Growing up, both of my parents were physically and emotionally abusive. When I was younger, they’d often hit (I had a lot of red marks) and yell at me for SPILLING WATER ON THE GROUND. She’d yell at me for such miniscule things that one time when I accidentally spilled water in school, my 6th grade band teacher told me to just put newspaper over it, and I, kid you not, asked him if he was mad. He replied “No. Why would I be mad? It’s just water.” When I was really young, I would go to my dad and show him something I made, but he’d reply with one word: “Go” which meant “get out of my room” or “go away.” He would do this alllllllll the time. “Go.”Before applying for high school, I really wanted to go to a prestigious school in my city, and I told my parents I wanted to go to x high school. My father started to tell me that I had no chance, but I told him I could do it. Still, he tried saying that I had no chance. He acted like such a kid when said “hah yeah right” when I told him I could do it.. He start asserting how that prestigious school I mentioned was “bullsh*t.” Soon, in my high school years, my parent’s stopped hitting me with closet hangers, and I assume it’s because I was older, and they were worry that I am able to tell authorities now; however, they continued to emotionally abuse me by telling me that my hairstyle is bad, saying things such as “your teachers hate your hairstyle” “It bothers them a lot so they really hate looking at you.” At random times, my parents would ask me to come over to them for a second, and there would be a photo of a girl on my father’s screen. She looks like some Chinese underage promoter or model, and my father would say “look at her hair style. You should get this hairstyle and look like her.” This happened more than I could ever count. If I were to estimate, I’d say that it happened at least 5 times EVERY month for 2 years. My parents got so annoyed that I kept denying what they wanted to do with my hair that my father felt like he needed to scream/yell “YOU’RE SO F**KING UGLY” to me when I was in my sophomore year of high school. In the same year, I attended an after school science program at the American museum of natural history. One time the bus took 40 minutes to come, and I tried to call my parents that I was going to be late, but my phone died. After the bus came and I walked home, I opened the door, and the very moment I take my first step into the house, my father shoves me to the ground and I land on my butt. It took both of my grandmothers to hold him back because he tried to hit me. He didn’t even give me a chance listen to what I had to say about the bus being late. In my junior year of high school, my parents would gossip about me while they had dinner. For example, I eavesdropped and my dad said “You think she (me) is so smart? Hah yeah right.” And then my mom would giggle/laugh WITH him. I didn’t ‘mention this in the beginning, but I have a younger brother, and he has never experienced these things from my parents (I get better grade than him, and I behave better, but he still doesn't experience the things I experience from my parents). They also never gossip about him.  In my senior year, my parents still gossip about me and my intelligence. It’s really ironic because I have great grades, while in high school, THEY had 55-60 grades (I saw their report cards before. My dad also kept lying to me about what school he went to: He told me that he went to a prestigious high school, but then another time he said he went to a high school with a completely different name. Additionally, my dad never went to college, but then he tells me that he went to Columbia University. :/ ). Now, I go out on the weekends a lot because I have to go to my acting and dancing studio, and my grandparents give me money to get myself food whenever I get hungry while I am outside because the first thing I do is get ready to go to my studio and not eat. They are really nice, it fathoms me how they are the parents of my parents. Because it is senior year and sending scores cost $15, I’ve decided to starve myself and save up the money to pay off the senior dues ($200) and college application/sending scores ($360) myself. Recently, I eavesdropped on my dad, and he thinks I’m lying about saving up the money. For example, my mom tells him “oh she’s saving up her money” and my dad would say “Hah. Is that even true?” Today, I arrived home, and my dad gave me a checkbook to write down the money I am putting into my bank account to see if I’m lying, but I have to use this money for my college applications.
Here is a little more info about my parents: I have never heard them talking about anything they share interests in or laughing about something funny together. It is ALWAYS something negative, always complaining, and always saying the words ""stupid"" or ""crazy"" regarding people they know. They gossip about other people—and me. My mom shares the same ideas with my dad, but it seems like she only acts like that when my dad is around. When my dad isn’t around, she seems more happy and free. (My mom was watching a drama show, and when she heard my dad coming home, she quickly turned it off and went to go act like she was cooking all day). My parents want me to go to college in the city because “you’re a female” and so I could stay home , but I’ve applied to great schools far away.

P.S : I cried a few times while I wrote this post, remembering those scenarios clearly. Sometimes I’ve considered plastic surgery because of my parents but I don’t think I would ever do it because it costs a lot, and sometimes when I’m in a happy mood with my significant other and friends, I’m fine with my looks. My cousin’s parents / my dad’s siblings are so different. They support me going to prestigious colleges far away, and they told me that they support me trying out new things for the sake of enjoying activities. I don’t get why my dad is the way he is, and I have always envied my cousins so much. 

*My mom is nice when my dad isn’t around

Update: 1/4/2018 : This morning, I made myself quinoa salad and my brother put pizza in the oven. Soon, my dad came out and saw the pizza in the oven without foil underneath it. I eavesdropped, and my dad said ""(Brother's name) Look at your sister. She's so lazy, she doesn't put foil in the oven--don't be like her."" How am I lazy? I have great grades, and he's talking to my brother who only plays video games all day and never studies, maintaining 60-70 grades. I got angry, so i came out and told him i didn't put the pizza in there, but he still persisted to say how I did. I went to my room, and I got really angry, so I started throwing random things around. I was at my peak, so I screamed ""GO TO HELL"" and my dad came out and started yelling at me 
""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU. YOU'RE CRAZY AND INSANE!""
Me: ""I DIDN'T PUT THE FREAKING PIZZA IN THE OVEN""
Dad: ""YOU ARE CRAZY AND INSANE""
Me: ""I DIDN'T PUT THE PIZZA IN THE OVEN BECAUSE I AM EATING MY OWN FOOD (Quinoa Salad)
Both of my grandmother's come in and start asking what's going on, my dad tells them that I'm dramatic and insane. I opened the door, and told them that he is blaming me for something I didn't do, not listening to me, and calling me ""lazy."" My dad then says ""I didn't call you lazy!"" But he's always a liar, it's not like it was surprising to me. Then I told them what was going on, and then my dad says ""If you didn't do then just tell me!"" WTF??!! I DID BUT HE WASN'T LISTENING TO ME. I swear he only said that because my grandmothers came. There wasn't even a need to mention me! If it was only about the pizza and foil, then just mention that!! Also, my brother didn't even say anything to defend me; He just sat there eating his food watching what was happening when HE was the one who put the pizza in the oven.",,False,,False,Advice,t5_2qjdm,,,public,,self,,,Am I right for wishing to stop communicating with my parents as soon as I leave for college and considering acting upon it?,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7o040y/am_i_right_for_wishing_to_stop_communicating_with/,all_ads,

My parents never liked my boyfriend who I've been with since middle school and wouldn't let me see him. So, when I turned 18 I kindly let them know that I would be moving in with him. 

They were furious and told me they wouldn't help me with college tuition. I'm trying to get my degree in the medical field and they make so much money that I'm not eligible for any scholarships or financial aid. At the time I was working in a factory and it just drained the life out of me. I was working 6+ days per week with constant mandatory overtime and it was a terrible environment. I had to get on antidepressants and got so stressed out/depressed that I'd be sick almost every day. I knew I wasn't making nearly enough money to afford school and would never have the time needed for my classes, so about 6mo ago I put in my notice and became a stripper. 

I've been much happier ever since and I actually have free time and money. I really enjoy it honestly, dancing is great stress relief, I love meeting new people, there's always music, it's help me overcome my social anxiety, and I've made wonderful friends. The club I work at its very safe and the staff is kind and protective and I never do anything but talk to people and give them a clean dance (not fully nude, I never do any extras, and I don't meet customers outside of the club). But this is purely temporary until I can complete my degree, I have no intentions of doing this long term.

Unfortunately, my family found out and is being very hateful over it. My mom told me that anyone who dances has ""major issues,"" that I'll be exposed to drugs, my boyfriend will dump me (we discussed it before I started and he totally respects that I need to do this for college and isn't jealous) etc. They don't even care to hear me out. 

My sister was also told all kinds of crazy bullshit I supposedly said about her, none of which is true but she won't believe me. Honestly, I think our relationship is completely ruined now. What really hurts is that my family has been far more disrespectful and hateful than any customer I've ever encountered. 

They also immediately jumped to money too, because that's all my dad seems to give a shit about. My dad gave my boyfriend a phone he had laying around a few months ago and was keeping me on his insurance because it's way cheaper that way. All he cared to say was that I need to return the phone and get my own damn insurance. He cancelled both within an hour, even though it was paid for by month. They also want to take my car, which was both my Christmas and birthday present, which they told me they paid for with my inheritance from a family member who passed away. They kept it in their name so I really can't do anything about it. They have like 3 spare cars just laying around which they never use already, so this is really just spite/punishment. 

I just don't know if I can continue to have a relationship with them, or even if I should, considering how hateful and judgmental they've been. Just because I dance doesn't make me any less of a human being.. I'm just doing what I need to. Should I try to fix this somehow, or go NC? If so, how can I fix it? It feels like they really don't care what I have to say and my privacy just feels so invaded. We've always had an extremely rocky relationship and this is really nothing new or unexpected whatsoever.. Is what I'm doing really so horrible?

We started working together back in November. We became pretty decent friends, mainly because she had a falling out with her entire friend group and afterwards gravitated to me after that happened. 

A little backstory with Jane - There have been three separate instances in which I had a pretty significant falling out with someone, and she remained friends with these people. Now, I’m definitely not going to tell her who she can and can’t be friends with, or force her to choose sides, but she would continuously talk about her relationships with these people to my face even after I asked her to stop because I had no desire to hear about it. In doing so, she essentially proved to me how high I rank on her totem pole of friends - that’s fine, but I made the conscious decision to keep Jane at arm’s length because I didn’t feel comfortable allowing her into my personal life knowing she remained friendly with people who were not friendly to me. 

Anyways, so back in April I left the place where we worked together (for unrelated reasons). However, one of my girlfriends that still worked there was there one night, so I stopped in to say hey. In doing so, I met Tiffany*. So Tiffany was hired after I left, but she and I really hit it off. The three of us ended up talking for over an hour (no customers in the store) and Tiffany and I exchanged phone numbers. Afterwards, Tiffany and I became practically inseparable. We have hung out every single day, I’ve become great friends with her girlfriend, they’ve both become great friends with my boyfriend, we have a really nice group dynamic and sincerely enjoy each other’s company. 

Tiffany reached out to me shortly after us becoming friends to express some concerns about Jane. She said she was unsure if Jane wanted the two of us to be friends. She said Jane had started making comments at work, such as “well you just don’t know OP like I do” or “you and OP aren’t as close and i am with OP” and when tiffany mentioned something I had told her, Jane stated “i already know that, me and OP talk all day every day we’re BEST friends” - this was an awkward development because as I’ve said, I have been keeping Jane at arm’s length and we surely don’t talk all day every day. I hadn’t even seen her in weeks when this conversation took place. 

After Tiffany and I spoke about this, I did notice Jane was acting odd when I would mention Tiffany, and then Tiffany told me that Jane had stared speaking negatively about me at work (completely out of the blue). Saying how I shouldn’t be trusted and how she wonders if I’m “fake.” This was pretty hurtful because I’ve never gone out of my way to be rude to Jane, even after everything happened with the three previously mentioned individuals.  When Tiffany and I first talked about it, we even made an effort to include her in our activities and invite her to go with us, in which she either repeatedly declined or if she did join, would make bare minimum conversation and stay on her phone all night. 

Tiffany has grown increasingly aggravated with Jane as well, because she’s constantly degrading me and Tiffany doesn’t like that Jane knows we are friends and still says the things she says. There have been two instances where Tiffany told her to stop, and yet it continues. 

Now I’m coming back to the job where Jane and Tiffany still work, and I don’t know how to handle the shift in friendships. I love Tiffany and I would not risk my friendship with her just to appease Jane, especially after Jane proved time and time again she wouldn’t do that for me. But I also don’t want to say anything to Jane about it and create more drama, even though with the way she’s been acting lately I feel like I have no choice.

My best friend (BF for short) has been openly gay and has been dating another girl for just over a year now. I’m quite an affectionate person so I hug my friends when greeting them and saying goodbye and we tell each other that we love one another and such. But now some of my friends have been pulling my BF to the side and saying that we’re too affectionate with one another? Today they placed bets that she wouldn’t be able to last a whole class without talking to me, or looking at me. I’m regretting so much coming out because maybe they wouldn’t be saying that we’re fucking if they thought I was straight? It’s making my BF feel like shit because she has a girlfriend already! They also said to her today that we had to admit our feelings to one another, like wtf my BF is family, I don’t fucking fancy her because I like girls as well as boys. It’s just infuriating and I don’t know what to do? The fact as well that they don’t mention it to me, just to her makes it even more shitty because I can’t defend myself.

He's 57 years old and is a convicted child molester. He has admitted to, and been caught with, two more children, both boys, one 5 and one 7 (their mothers didn't want those boys to have to testify or even have to admit to what happened so they never called the police), and his conviction was against a 5 year old girl.  We don't know how many more there were.  He moved away to a state that doesn't require him to register, although I called and told the local police about him anyway.  They thanked me but couldn't make him register in his new state because his conviction occured before Megan's Law was enacted. He's been married before and she had a boy and girl (not his) who were 7 and 12 when we met her.  We told his then wife what he was and she said that god has forgiven him and she wasn't worried.  After she left him, we dont know why, he moved to another state that doesn't require him to register.   Again, I called his local police department and they didn't care.  He's only required to register in the state that convicted him, so of course he's never coming back here.  So, back to his Facebook page... I'm inclined to take a picture of it and post it to a Facebook group in his city and warn them.  Once you put something on the internet it never goes away.  I don't consider it slander because it's true and verifiable.  But is it wrong?  Would you want to know that your neighbor has molested 3 different children that we know about and isn't required to register?  Would you want to know who your kids are interacting with? His conviction was 38 years ago. Should I let it go and just move on?  Once it's out there on the internet, he may never be able to get away from it.  But maybe that's what should happen?

Hello,  
I am in the state of Pennsylvania and as mentioned above, I had to call the cops not too long before writing this post. My friend who lives just with her abusive dad as her mother has passed asked me to because she was terrified he'd hurt her badly.  
EVIDENCE  
In the past he has hit her many times across the legs, face, buttocks, thighs, stomach, and really any other area with his fists and with a belt. He has threatened to get a hammer in the past. He has destroyed 2 of her phones, and has broken a school Chromebook because she has not done a chore or just because he felt like it. He is extremely bipolar. While she takes her away to Puerto Rico and ignores her to go out drinking, the one time she was sleeping in shorts and he hit her inner thigh with a belt to wake her up. There was blood and there is a scar left over, that she did not reveal to the police this night for unknown reasons. He verbally abuses her and calls her a pig, a slut, and many other things. He also takes away her freedoms and pushes her to do everything around the house, and often times forgets to feed her.

INCIDENT

On March 3, 2019, 8:33PM I called the police as he came home from being gone all day presumably drinking and due to her not doing laundry he flipped her bed and I was told as of writing this smashed her phone again. The girl was scared, and asked me to call the police (we've had a plan in place if I needed to so I had info on what to say to them, address and all), and I did. 2 or 3 state troopers were dispatched and I was asked by her to get there as they asked her if she was being picked up. My parents drove me and when we got there, we were told to wait as they had to call CPS. After waiting for a while, one of the troopers returned looking disappointed and told us that due to the fact he didn't hit her this night and that there were no bruises nothing could be done and he was just parenting. So this was completely chocked up as fine and everything continues as normal.

OUTCOME

I am very scared for her and my safety. He does not like me for some reason and knows where I live. I'm worried that he will be worse to her and hurt her with a hammer, or just hurt her in general. I am also worried he will come to my house and do something as he does not seem mentally stable. The only other person she has to go to closest is in Nebraska and my parents have both stated they are okay with housing her here as they have gone through abuse themselves.

I am the mother of a 3 year old Blue Heeler/ Catahoula hound mix. He is more than a handful. 
First off, he's an escape artist. I cannot leave him outside, he WILL get out. If I leave him inside (which I do) he wrecks my house. Tears curtains and pulls them down, knocks things over and breaks them when he jumps on furniture, and pees everywhere. Today I took him out and played with him for almost an hour, left to go to the store, and he'd peed on my fridge, my stove and my trash can while I was gone for an hour. 
I'm thinking about trying to crate train, but this dog has broken chains, chewed through wire cables, and ripped his toenails off jumping fences. I'm honestly afraid he might hurt himself in a crate. 
I thought about rehoming him, but I will NOT let him go anywhere that I don't know for a fact he'll be the only dog, have a human around most of the time, and be loved even more dearly than I love him now. He deserves a better human. 
This whole situation hurts. I was young and irresponsible when I got him. I'm only slightly older and slightly more responsible now, and I hate myself for this. He deserves much better and I don't know what to do. I never should have gotten this dog, but now I have him and I love him and I don't know where to go from here.

My gf broke up with me like 3 months ago and i wont get into why other than she felt i was too good for her. We kept in touch afterwards and were really close friends and a little too close at times, but nonetheless things kept happening that pulled us apart and i felt stressed. Idk if i may have overreacted but i ended up blocking her when the summer began because i just couldnt take being around her anymore. 
Ive been stressing and crying and hurting myself nearly everyday this summer because i feel so guilt ridden about the entire relationship and i miss her and just so much more, but this isnt the main point.

Today, someone that is both of our friends randomly decided to text her asking why she broke up with me, saying ""by his side it seems like u broke up with him because he was bored."" i never said this, like i said she broke up with me because I was ""too good"" or ""overly affectionate."" So, she is obviously mad and assumes i was talking smack about her. She blocks the friend and posts on her public snap that im basically an asshole, garbage human being that i should kms and rot and fuck myself and such, that im spreading rumors about her even tho she explained why we broke up, which she did. I feel like theres something i can do other than just wait, and even waiting feels wrong because i think everyone hates me now. I never even did anything in this scenario it was forced onto me. Idk what to do or how to feel.

This may seem like nothing but money is very tight so wondering what anyone would do in my situation.

My partner (34f) and I (29m) both work full time trying to pay off student debt. My partner’s colleague offered a babysitting/school run job for either of us as and when we’re available.

I’ve been doing a morning school run a couple of times a week pretty regularly, and we get the odd Saturday night babysit job together sometimes. All the time it’s been $20 an hour, regardless of if it’s just me or both of us, the kids are awake or asleep, we’re playing or dropping to school. 

We all took a break as they went on holiday and we were too busy. Then while my partner was away I did a midweek late night babysit and noticed she paid me $15 an hour. Not the end of the world, regardless could have been a mistake. Then we both did a Saturday night babysit and we got $15 an hour for that. I’ve just finished a school run as I write this and waiting to see what she pays, expecting the $15.

I know it’s not massive money, but 5 hours of work for $100 is huge for us, rather than $75. I don’t know if this is a misunderstanding or she’s decided to drop our rate and hope we just don’t notice/put up with it.

It’s awkward because I want to text her and ask if there’s any reason why, but I don’t want to put my partner in an awkward spot at work then.

I don't have anybody else to talk to about this so I'm coming to you guys. It's mostly to do with a girl.

**Background:**

I started working with this girl, I'll call her Emma, who's my age and in her mid twenties. That was last summer in 2017. Now, she has a bit of a history. Married twice. Both of them left her for shitty reasons. She's got a few mental illnesses. Used to be a druggie but got clean before she got pregnant. Oh yeah and she has a toddler. She's the type of girl that I'm usually not interested in because I can see the heart break coming a mile away, not to mention that most people see me as a sheltered guy that wouldn't mesh with that personality.

I'm actually a virgin. I had a girlfriend in high school but we never got to actually having sex because she wanted to wait. Everything since then hasn't lasted more than a month or two and usually ends with her leaving me after several dates because I was just supposed to be a rebound. I also didn't start drinking till I was about 18. Never did anything harder than weed and even that wasn't until recently, and I don't plan on doing it again because I want to become a cop after college which means no drugs. So I'm a little sheltered maybe. But I've had more than my fair share of hardships in life. Dad died when I was 12, grandad when I was 19. My sister is a narcissist. I was bullied growing up. I've never had a real best friend that I could be completely open with and trust to be there for me. I'm halfway suicidal (never attempted but definitely contemplated, more so recently). I'm pretty sure I deal with depression, I'm trying to get that confirmed by a therapist here at some point. and I've basically been alone through it all and ever since.

So Emma and I started talking a little and hit it off enough that we were sort of seeing each other for about 2 months. Now, since I'm a virgin we never did anymore than handsy makeout sessions for those 2 months we were talking. Which was mostly down to the fact that I have no fucking clue what I'm doing and don't know when to start heading for the bedroom. She was coming clean off her last divorce when we met so she was still kind of fucked up and really just looking for a rebound. But she acted like she wanted a boyfriend despite the fact that she stated otherwise so I just went along with it.

Things didn't go well. A ""friend"" of mine, we'll call Dick, got involved, I got squeezed out because of Dick's chemistry with her and she stopped confiding in me. I found out she was talking to other guys and going on dates, which I assumed anyway so I didn't freak out about it. But eventually she told me she wanted to stop the physical stuff and just be friends. I got angry and confronted her about how we weren't really friends because she only talked to Dick (I later found out he was actually trying to get a threesome going between her and his girlfriend of 7 ish years, which I don't believe ever happened). I was pissed that she was treating me like she wanted a boyfriend while also pushing me away, lying to my face about dating other guys, and trying to get into a relationship, just not with me. I didn't end up telling her any of that, and we wound up being assholes to each other for the next 4 or 5 months.

While Emma and I had a dislike for each other, Dick would sometimes fill me in on Emma despite me not asking, so he told me about how she was seeing some guy, we'll call Steve. Steve was married with 2 kids, a cop and volunteer SWAT officer, had money, and was good looking. He ended up blocking her on social media because his wife found out and I figured that was the end of that.

**Fast Forward to Now:**

Dick wound up pissing off Emma and they're no longer friends. I got tired of being angry all the fucking time since I see Emma at work a lot and just decided to let things sort of happen the way they we're gonna happen. Her and I are flirty friends and now I'm one of the only people she has that she can count on and vice versa. She's been in an off and on relationship with Steve who's only now getting divorced 10 months after he and Emma started talking because his wife got tired of his shit and is trying to take everything he has. Emma made some intimate mistakes with her best friend recently that ruined her friendship with him, so they don't talk anymore and she felt guilty about it because she's technically seeing Steve still. So now I'm really her closest friend apart from Steve.

Emma and Steve are working things out while he gets divorced. I'm depressed and trying to rely on Emma to help me as a friend because I don't have anyone else who gives a shit. She only helps so much though because she still has her kid to take care of and is made happy by Steve in a way that I can't. I'm just not a priority. So I've been trying to manage on my own, figuring out why I feel like shit, and I figure that it's because I still have feelings for Emma. Problem is, she's in love with Steve. I've also worked out that Steve is actually the guy she started seeing behind my back and left me for. When they started talking, he lied and said he was separated from his wife which he was very much not. So now I'm pissed off again, because now I'm remembering all the shitty things she did to me leading up to her leaving me and how Steve played into it and how she said she didn't want a relationship but ended up in a 10 month thing with Steve, and now she won't leave him since he's getting divorced, they finally have a real chance, and he needs her help to get through it all. She knows I don't like Steve but I still try to support it because he makes her happy. Which pisses me off more that he does and I don't.

**Advice:**

So here's where I need help. I'm falling apart. I don't have anybody else to confide in but Emma who I have a lot of feelings for still, but Emma only wants Steve. Steve doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon unless he fucks up again. Which he's fucked up a lot and Emma still loves him, so it would take a monumental fuck up at this point. I'm heartbroken over how things went between Emma and me, I also can't forgive her for the way she handled it. I haven't told her any of this stuff because I'm afraid doing that means the end of our friendship, which I still value since I don't have anybody else. No one else in my life knows what I deal with. No one else knows that I think about suicide. Everyone I've ever tried to come to for help just kind of brushes it off and goes on with their life. I feel worthless. I feel intensely alone and have lost hope that that's ever gonna change. Emma cares as much as she can, which isn't as much as I need but is still more than anybody else ever has.

I want to tell her. I wanna get it off my chest because seeing her with him pisses me off so much. Knowing that he's a lying prick and that he got away with it while I'm left here with nothing makes me so angry because I've never had anything, while he comes from a decent family, has a good career, has (had) a wife, kids etc. Emma constantly says I'm a great guy and she doesn't understand how I'm a virgin. That I'm attractive. I don't know how I still am either except that maybe I'm a little bit shallow/picky and am severely lacking in self-esteem, but I just wanna confront her about it since she had the choice and chose him. I want to tell her that the reason I'm falling apart is because of our unresolved issues. Maybe ripping off the bandaid and cutting her off as a friend would be best for me, but I still have to work with her. I would still have to see her, she would still accept me as her friend because she doesn't have anyone other than Steve at this point and she's also borderline suicidal, and I wouldn't be able to stay away because I have feelings for her and care about her. I don't want to see her get hurt or hurt herself. I just want to be furious right now. I want to have it out with Emma. I don't want to lose her though because I like having her as a friend, and I still feel that if Steve ever leaves then her and I might still have something.

If you read all that you're a saint and I appreciate you. Normally I'd just suck it up and have the conversation with her and cut her out of my life. I've done that before so being in this situation now and reading through all of it makes me feel embarrassed that I can't just do it, but I've also never been this good of friends with somebody that I used to have a thing with, who I still have feelings for. I know it's manipulative to be her friend all while hoping her and I get back together some day, but part of me still just wants to bite my tongue and try to move on while staying friends.

I have told him before that I am an atheist and that I was at one point a Christian as that is how I was raised, but I had many bad experiences with it and, since I’m taking a course in science, religion just isn’t for me. I’ve explained that to him and yet he continues to try and get me to go to all these Christian events. 

The tipping point that is really making me start disliking him is that I have told him countless times and he KNOWS that I am having financial difficulties and grew up in a family living on the poverty line, but he is trying to pressure me into going to a camp that will cost $400, that is for Christians. I don’t want to go partly because I am not interested in becoming a Christian and also partly because I do not have that kind of money at all. 

I don’t want to be rude or offend him by saying that I’m not going because I am not interested in Christianity, and trying to explain to him that I just don’t have the money won’t work. I’ve tried it, he just doesn’t accept it as a reason.

To be happy.

To be happy alone, to not need to rely solely on others to be happy.

I exercise regularly, maintain an averagely health diet, have an average bmi, enough friends, great family, volunteer. But I’m empty. Angry. Boring. 

Somethings missing. I just want to find what I love doing but I can’t in the small shitty town and I’m 17 with little money.

And for 4 years, I've stayed home to take care of him. He's a bright, happy, truly wonderful little boy that I love more than anything. I feel guilty even saying this, but feel like I've lost myself in the process of shaping my son.

Someone asked me the other day what my favorite song was.

I couldn't answer.

I have no idea.

I haven't listened to music that wasn't: classical, aimed at kids, or disney, since my son was born. My old favorite bands, I'm not too interested in anymore. I used to be all about rap and hard rock. Now, I can't stand most of it.

So...I have no idea what sort of artists I like. Absolutely no clue where to even start. But I can tell you my top 10 favorite disney songs, and my favorite kid's artists.

I realized at that point that there was a problem. So I started asking myself what else I liked. What did I like to do?

Reading, running, and cooking used to be the answer.

Now it isn't. I go on runs all the time, but I always have our son with me. I like it, but it isn't an ""me"" activity anymore.

I read...kids books. I haven't read an adult book cover to cover in over a year.

I cook...with my son. And I like it a lot. We have fun. It makes my heart happy that he enjoys the process of making dinner. But again...not a me activity.

I starting thinking about what I love most, and the answers are all the same. I love taking him to gymnastics. I love taking him to the zoo. I love finding a good book that he loves and listening to him read. 

I can't think of a single thing I like that doesn't involve him. And I'm feeling so sad because of that. I feel like I lost who I was. I lost the person I used to be. I'm not really a person anymore, I'm just a mom.

I've talked, in passing, to my husband about getting a job. But I don't think it's realistic. My son is academically so far ahead of other children his age, that I'm not sure school is the best option for him. 

He turns 4 next month, and he reads beginner chapter books. (Things like Magic School Bus, Magic Tree House, Hey Jack, and Junie B. Jones.) He had mastered adding and subtracting, and is in the beginning stages of memorizing the multiplication table.

We spoke to all three local 4k's, and we were told they wouldn't really be able to work with us. One of them pushed us to put him in 4k anyway, despite the fact that he would be bored to tears with what they're learning. They reasoned that he needs the socialization. But he gets a lot of that in gymnastics, and our playgroup. (We go to playgroup 3x a week, and gymnastics 2x a week. We also do story time at the library, and go to parks. Socially he is well adjusted.)

We've reached out to 4 local elementary schools, and we were told something very similar. They don't move kids up to the higher grades, even if they test out of them. They can't put him in a different classroom. They can try to give him more challenging work, but they can't promise that it will be a regular occurance.

It seems like I would be doing him a disservice by placing him in school. (It's worth mentioning that we live in an area that is well known for not being overly enthusiastic about their schooling programs.) Our doctor actually raised the same concern. We recently changed doctors, and our son was reading through one of the kids books there. He was reading quickly, kind of whizzing through it, and our doctor just asked ""What do you intend to do for school?"" And went on to say that he was unimpressed with the local school systems, and struggled finding a fit for his daughter.

I'm feeling so lost.

I want to be a good mom. I want to make sure my kid gets every opportunity in life. I want to continue to make sure he becomes the best he can. But I've also lost sight of who I am...and it's scary.

I want a life. I want a career. I want to prove my worth as a human by bringing money in. I also want to make sure my son has every chance possible at success, and I'm afraid that will mean me staying home...at least for the next few years while we prepare to move.

I already posted about it on Reddit under another account and subreddit.

They started dating, he seemed nice enough and my sister seemed happy. They are both sixteen nearly seventeen. She stays there maybe once or twice a week (and yes she is on contraception). 

She is at college and wants to be a beautician, she always said he is looking for a job. 

I have started noticing a few things recently which are too boring and long winded to share now, but it feels like she was lying for him a lot, and he always was borrowing her pocket money and not giving it back and a lot of other minor things that started to bother me.

She splits up with him about two weeks ago. I ask why she said he has been smoking a lot of weed and has no ambition. I thought this was very sensible of her and was happy. Until Friday. 

I’m looking after my two younger sisters while my mum has gone to see my nana who’s not very well. On Friday my sister tells me she is staying with her boyfriend/ ex boyfriend. I couldn’t really do much about it but I just warned her to be careful and to come straight home the next day. I spoke to his mother who assured me she would be ok.

She came back as promised safe and well. Her phone breaks on Saturday night, she asks to borrow mine which is fine. I don’t use my phone very often. She gave it back to me when I asked just so I could check my messages etc. I looked at my notifications this morning and there are some from him (obviously to my sister through her social media accounts). I will stress I did not mean to see them and I wasn’t snooping they were just there. Her is how they went:  

1.your are a f***ing re****d where are you who are you with 
2.swear on your mums life you are not with lads
3. Tell me where you are 

I will point out she was in the house with me all weekend apart from popping to McDonald’s yesterday and bringing back our lunch.

I am being biased but she is a good girl, not perfect by any means but she wouldn’t be with another guy. 

I just found the whole thing quite disturbing, my sister doesn’t know I know yet. Im not sure what to do really. Im worries he’s controlling her. I just know she shouldn’t be with this boy, he sounds controlling and nasty. I don’t know how to talk to her about it, I don’t want to have a pop at her, that might push her away and she might start defending him as she has in the past. I think if I’m too soft she won’t listen. Is it acceptable to call him or his mother? Am I over reacting? I don’t think I am? Also I don’t want to worry my mother as of yet until she’s back as she has enough on her plate.

If I apply for a job, I most cases get a phone interview or whatever their initial interview is. But somewhere along their I just blow it.

I know the market can be tough, but it has happened so many times it can't be that someone else always did slightly better or will take slightly less money.

I'm talking years and dozens of interviews. Occasionally I walk out and smack myself in the face because I realize I've done something boneheaded, but sometimes I think I've done great and I get a rejection. At least half of the rejections I get say that they aren't moving forward with the position any longer, so I can't even ask for feedback as to why I didn't get the job, but then without fail I checked LinkedIn and they hired someone else. 

A few months ago a company I had done some business with contacted me. Pursued me, brought me in for several interviews, made a very casual verbal offer, asked when I could start, had me meet nearly everyone there, and then I never heard from them again. I'm quite sure these things happen, but it just KEEPS happening to me I have to think that I'm the common denominator. I send a polite and not demanding follow up email, and usually it's ignored. 

Am I horrible? I think I'm confident yet modest, I can sometimes be way too chatty but I have really worked on that and I'm more precise with my words, I try to be funny but not make anyone laugh (like a light humor not joke telling).

I have an interview tomorrow and I want the job so FREAKING bad. They reached out to me on LinkedIn so I know my background fits. I had a long phone interview with the recruiter and filled out a lengthy (like took an hour), and landed the in person interview but I want to know what thing I could be doing that is preventing me from getting jobs.

I hope someone here might be able to help me out. I am struggling with a huge sense of guilt and fear over the person I am and the ways in which I spend my time. I think a lot of this is due to being an introvert and being surrounded by extroverted people/institutions. I feel a deep inadequacy when I look at the world around me. I feel guilty and fearful of wasting my life sitting at home at my computer, but I also don't particularly enjoy when I go out and do other things, and even more so I'm not sure what ""other things"" I should be spending more of my time doing. All I really enjoy doing is playing video games, watching tv, reading, drinking coffee, and hanging out at coffee shops/restaurants. I don't particularly enjoy physical activity and I'm pretty shy. 

I keep comparing myself and my life to the following: 

* The ""monk:"" The kind of person who spends their time in isolation, usually outdoors, focusing on meditation and spiritual growth. I feel guilty for not living a life like this because I feel it would be more meaningful than my western lifestyle.
* The ""western suburban mom:"" The kind of person who really lives for western achievements like graduating college, getting married, buying a house, having children, retiring, etc. I have never really felt successful in achieving these cultural milestones, but I also feel unsuccessful when I don't follow this path.
* The ""outdoorsy hippie:"" The kind of person who spends all of their time adventuring, traveling, and being outdoors. Sort of the modern hippie.
* The ""artist:"" The kind of person who spends most of their time creating, whether that is writing or doing music or painting.

I continue to compare myself to these stereotypes and am really struggling with the fact that I fall more along the following\- the ""hermit:"" The kind of person who spends most of their time indoors at their computer, except for when they go to work. It makes me feel like I'm missing out on a more meaningful, important life in some way. Every time I try to change my lifestyle though I fall back into the same patterns and habits. I can't tell if my current life is just a habit or if it's actually what I prefer. Am I feeling unnecessary pressure to change and to cultivate a better life? Or am I actually longing for a different kind of life? I really have no idea.

Thanks for letting me rant here. I hope this resonates with someone, as I'd really like some external input. I've been spending too much of my time beating myself up over these things and it's gotten rather neurotic.

But now I’m thinking that I’ve hurt her and if I caused her to self harm or something worse than that I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.

First of all, this isn't mine.
My mother's friend brought us a bird she has while she went on holiday. She will be missing for 1 month. Seemed like nothing, how hard can a bird be? Yet it seems impossible to keep it alive until September.
It just falls on the bottom of the cage and tries to walk on the right side of it's head. It's as if it had a stroke. We called her, she said ""It's fine, it's whatever. Just get it some water"". 10/10 advice, as if any of the 3 tanks of water it has are empty. It's been like this for a couple of days and I'm really worried about it. We called her again and she said ""*Sigh* I had 2 other birds that had the same thing and didn't make it"". I'm furious to be honest. She got rid of her responsibility yet we now have a poor bird to take care of.

Now, I want you guys to focus on advices on how to save the bird, not how to handle its owner. Has anyone had anything similar?

She just recently went out of town with family and it just so happened to also be my birthday (July 2nd) week, and Independence day also. I come home from work today and find a puzzle box lying on the ground (was on the dresser at the end of the bed, one of the cats that we have must have knocked it off) with a cable sticking out of it, I open it, and find a ""hidden"" camera. I haven't given her any reason to not trust me, I feel, betrayed, violated, and many other things. 

I guess my question is, have any of you been in a similar situation? How'd you handle it? How'd it play out?

My brother and I have always been close. We’ve always had each other’s backs, despite him being popular and sporty and me being not. 

Well when he was 24, he got mixed up with the wrong crowd of people, partied a lot and ended up getting addicted to cocaine, and got kicked out of his post-graduate college. 

His life basically went on a downward spiral after that, he had to work part time jobs, had to move into a cheaper apartment, and his long time girlfriend, who is a saint, had to leave him because she couldn’t handle his downward spiral anymore. My brother stole money from our parents, and basically did some shady shit for his dealer in order to get drugs. 

I think once his girlfriend left him though, it was a wake up call. My parents and I had basically stopped all contact with him because we couldn’t deal with him anymore. 

Long story short, he came to me and asked for my help. I was only 19 but I did my best to help him and he got sober. His girlfriend came back to him and he’s back at school doing what he loves.  

He lives in the city over so last weekend I went to visit him and stayed at his place for a few days. 

I needed to borrow a shirt from him so I opened his closet door and a small bag fell to the floor from the top shelf of the closet. 

Yeah. It was coke. I’ve never touched that shit but I was around it enough when I was helping my brother get sober so I know what it looks like. 

I’m honestly devastated. That shit ruined his life and he’s been doing so well. 

Here’s my dilemma: If he’s doing it again, I need to know so I can help him before it ruins his life again. But maybe it’s an old bag? If it is I don’t want to accuse him of using again and have him think I don’t trust him. 

What should I do?

I applied to these colleges not knowing if I will get in. My parents are basically telling me fuck you, you have too much pride and you thought you could get in. The schools I applied to were UCB, UCD, UCSB, UCLA, and VT. I also applied to Rutgers as in state and I got waitlisted. I checked their data of waitlisties from the previous year it was less than 1% admitted, and I'm still waiting for my one school to respond. 

My Mother called me a failure straight to my face. I don't know what to say, she thinks I do nothing all day and probably nothing in school, but I tell her I work incredibly hard in school I study to the best of my ability. I guess she just doesn't believe me because I don't let her helicopter parent me or something of that matter. At home she thinks all I do is play video games or something. I don't at all, I have twitch open which I alt tab between working on school work or personal programming projects that I do, or work on my Mom's website for her small business. I play a game with friends maybe every week. This week I tried out streaming again, which may be some reason to call me a failure I don't know I just start to play a game once in a week and they want to say I've been doing nothing but playing games. It is so frustrating and I can't get through to them that this is what I do. They even blame it on me not communicating when I'm in my room working on something they want me to come out all the time and tell them what I'm doing like I'm working for them.

My parents then go on to tell me that going my state college, and county college would make me a complete failure and they wouldn't want me going there. My Mother is an accountant and she tells me all the time that my private school is an investment from her to me. She sees this as a failed investment as I didn't get into any school yet.

Then they went on to the basic parent lecture with repetition to how I am wasting away ""Just like the parable with the Talents."" They also said that I should look to find a school that is still looking for applications that I could transfer the credits to one of the UC schools if I have the ability to which I also thought about.

She says I have no options, which I admit I didn't exactly plan them, I've thought them through, which could be:


If not accepted go to community/state college


Find a job


Find a college that is still accepting applications that I could transfer credits into a UC school.

Sorry for this, I just wanted to get advice on this matter (and vent a little) my parents think they know everything about me and they even admit they don't because ""I don't tell them enough"" which is bullshit because I tell them the basic concept of what I'm doing and they leave my room or they just don't say anything at all. So I don't know what they want from me when they don't ask me anything in the first place.

It was such a slow transition, I barely realized my views had been diverging from those of my friends' until I listened to them being outraged over the pay gap or treating Trump's presidency like the end of the world and realizing we were on entirely different levels.
I go to a small school of a more liberal persuasion than the rest of my state. I've been there since 4th grade, and known most of my friends from at least 6th. I'm in my senior year of high school, and we'll probably go to different colleges. Still, that's one more semester with them, and they're my only close friend group. They're not bad people, but I've seen them get really angry at people who disagree with intersectional feminist viewpoints. I'm terrible with people. If they started flipping out, I'd probably start crying, and would probably cry even more when we got back to school and share classes. I don't like it, and wish I could control my tear ducts, but there's not much I can do about that. Hell, if I even think about this too much, my eyes start watering. I've got some problems with anxiety and rejection.
Well, they asked me to come to them with the women's march, and I accepted, since I think it would be an interesting experience. But it got me thinking.
What if I brought a sign, some small symbol of my disagreement? It could say ""Respec Wamen"" or ""REEspect"" or something. I don't know. It'd be fun to shitpost irl.
Maybe I've been on reddit too long...

TL;DR: Non-feminist in a progressive friend group thinking of hinting at/revealing her true colors at the women's march tomorrow

Anyways, has anyone else been in a situation like mine (I mean, I'm sure people *have* but has anyone reading this)? What did you do? How did whoever you come out to react? Was it worth it? Should I just keep my head down for one more semester? Am I blowing this out of proportion? If I do bring a sign, what should it say? How overt should it be?
Answers to any or all of those questions would be great. I know this isn't as serious as a lot of the problems on this sub, but I'm not sure how many options I've got irl.

I'm 18 and in the last week have been experiencing severe memory loss (as much as being unable to recall much from as little a day ago, everything before then is blacked out except for bits and pieces. Like, even basic stuff like what day of the week it was yesterday takes me a minute to remember/ figure out.), balance issues, bad headaches, nausea, speech problems, vomiting, blood and mucus in poop, stiff/painful neck and disorientation to the point of it making me less functional at work and school. The E.R said that these symptoms are obviously indicative of something wrong but discharged me because the threat wasn't immediate / my vitals looked fine. The E.R couldn't find anything, though, except for a sinus infection.  But they agreed that his wouldn't cause my symptoms. Still, because my vital signs were ok, they discharged me.

This is ***getting bad***, though. I couldn't tell you where I was or what I did three days ago. I don't know. I don't immediately remember what day it is without using context clues to remember (ex: where am I currently and why?) and I keep asking customers the same things over and over at work. My coworkers notice. I'm an orphan so I'm pretty much on my own with figuring this stuff out. I'm going to schedule my first ever appointment with a Primary Care doctor tomorrow and know I probably should go back to the E.R given how rapidly my symptoms have worsened.. I've been there multiple times and all they do is check my vitals and discharge me without explanation.. Thing is, fungal meningitis (something that causes all of my symptoms) doesn't show up on the tests they've ran on me. And I have reason to believe I have a variation of it.

I stached my weed in a baggie in mud behind the garbage in my allyway where it was often exposed to dirt and rain water. I once even found ***animal poo******p*** on it's bag, once. The bag had some holes in it at times. Unhealthy stuff. Regardless, I smoked it consistently for quite a while. Contaminated cannabis has caused something called   Cryptococcal meningitis([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374632](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374632)) which is a type of fungal meningitis that is super common in places like the dirt where I left my weed. I haven't smoked in two weeks, mind you. No, I'm not *just high*. I have ample reason to believe I have any kind of meningitis, to be honest, but I couldn't explain how I contracted it without remembering that I smoked some pretty dirty weed. All of the tests that the E.R ran on me wouldn't detect something like meningitis, which is the only single thing I've been able to find online that matches my symptoms. I didn't mention the weed being in the dirty behind garbage next to feces to the E.R before because I didn't consider the weed to be relevant to my illness. I hadn't even smoked in a while. I'm afraid they won't take me seriously because I'm a drug user, too (ex: they might be hesitant to do a spinal tap on me thinking that I'm just a junkie whose looking to be sedated.)

We have a spare bedroom which my dad and younger siblings are going to be sharing while my dad is getting his life together and finding a new place after his girlfriend left him to handle the bills alone. The thing is my dad has decided to retire to his home country and leave all his kids behind, my two younger sisters ,(12&amp;17), and my brother, (15) who lived with him would have to find a place.

The mere thought of having a sexual encounter makes me fee like I'm going to vomit. I'm scared that I will never give oral sex again without feeling that I'm poisoning myself. To be clear, it's not the HPV itself that I'm scared of. I'm aware that like eighty percent of people will get HPV, and it's mostly asymptomatic. The cancer risk is what's terrifying me.

She also had some boy issues that we talked about and seemingly got through, but she is still feeling torn apart by a lot of the things and of course is still grieving over her father's passing.

She normally will text me late at night because she is a party girl and I'm usually awake because I get anxious at night and find it hard to sleep. The first time I was able to talk with her about her self harm temptation and even though I couldn't stop her from self harming I was an outlet for her until her friend made it to her apartment to be with her and make sure she was safe.

Last night she text me at 3 am and I was asleep because I have had a lot of important things this weekend and have been busy. I'm staying with my parents and they go to bed early so I don't stay up late so that I can respect them wanting to sleep. I woke up this morning to texts from her saying she was going to cut and that she was hiding. I don't know what to do. I'm a psych major who just finished getting my degree but I know I'm not equipped to handle someone self harming, especially my own friend, without getting my higher education and my certification as an LPC. Her mother is very strict and so she has been very free and party heavy since she got out of the nest. The alcohol doesn't help of course, as it is a depressant. I don't know how to make sure she is okay because I live so far away and I can't be sure that I will be awake Everytime she needs an outlet.

I've dated women of different races; race has never been a consideration for me. I know I'm not supposed to judge her preference, but it just pains me to think that my own sister considers our race inferior to another race. In addition, even if you have a preference, I think that her aversion towards Asian-born men is rather unjustifiable. What if that person is just as nice as every other man? What if he speaks English well and is more intelligent than most men she has met? I'm dating a black woman who came to the U.S. from Nigeria when she was 14. I've also dated Chinese-American and Chinese-born girls in college and high school. I really don't know why a person wouldn't date an individual based on race and country of origin. It's just straight discriminatory. As long as we're compatible (personality, wealth, intelligence, etc.), why should I care about her race or which country she grows up in?

I really don't know why she feels the way she does. I guess it's just pure physical attraction? It's just unsettling to think that my own sister (and several other Asian women) feels this way about men of our own race.

 I've never been a person who cares for trivia. I don't even know why I care so much. I'm just in need of a way to get this off my mind. I've also told my s/o this, but she just told me to simply ignore it.

This is going to be very long and not very happy, I'm sorry.

I worked at my last company for 2 years. I was the best at my job at my old location, but I transferred due to a move about 4 months ago. My new boss just did not like me from the very beginning. She would constantly make fun of my teeth to the other managers when she thought I couldn't hear. I have white, clean teeth, but they're a bit crowded and crooked in some places. She ended up demoting me from a hostess to a bus girl because I just don't have ""the look"". I take very good care of myself, and I even do modeling on occasion. I'm not at all an ugly girl, but her comments and comparisons to my peers really wore down on me. I felt very singled out and let down by my company failing to protect me. I continued to stay at the job, because I didn't have another one lined up yet. I started to look, though.

My coworkers noticed that the boss did this to me, and some of them stuck up for me. A couple of them even wrote her a formal letter, stating ""SpageddyLee does her job very well, and we enjoy working alongside her as a hostess."" Their hearts were in the right place, but I think it just made her more mad. She then told me that I would probably never move out of the bus boy position as long as I worked there. 

My boyfriend is the most supportive man in the whole world. He noticed that the job began to affect me outside of work. I stopped being able to eat, which caused me to lose a lot of weight. I was already less than 120 lbs, so this was not at all a welcome change. I looked sick, I was angry and sad all the time, and I developed major body image issues. I started to cry HOURS before I was scheduled, and would cry for HOURS after getting home. My boss also fired the other busser, making it impossible for me to EVER call out a shift, due to not even having another person trained to do my job working there. (This is important). He ended up telling me, ""If this job ever makes you want to end your life, I want you to tell me, and then never talk to those people again.""

Although I continued to look for jobs, I wasn't really getting any offers. I live in a really bad area for jobs, Whatever, I thought, I'll just have to deal with living unhappily until I can get out. I stayed with my bully of a boss, who continued to add more and more work to my workload. One day, I showed up for a shift on a day we were really slow. Two of my managers were sitting up at the front desk. They looked me straight in the eyes and told me to go home, because we were slow. I had multiple witnesses to this. The next day, I come in and I have a Final Written Warning for a No call/no show, written up by the manager who TOLD ME TO LEAVE! I couldn't contest it, it was my word against the manager's word, who insisted I never showed up, even though she's the one who told me to leave, and both hosts and one bartender saw this happen and stood up for me. I ended up having to take the final written.

I don't think I've ever seen my boyfriend so angry. He's a manager at a different-but-similar company, and he told me that he had never seen another manager do something so blatantly mean and two-faced. He urged me to quit. He told me it isn't worth the pain it's causing me, and that he worries all the time about my mental health. I have severe anxiety and depression. I knew he was right, but I still couldn't leave.

We found out we were pregnant almost immediately after this. I was so excited. Life was looking up for me. The job still made me want to die, but I had that baby to look forward to, so I went to work every day and thought about that, instead of my evil bosses and unfair workload.

Later on, present day, last week. I'm about 12 weeks along. I started to spot before my shift. Panicked, I called my boss and tried to call out. She knew I was pregnant, and possibly miscarrying, but wouldn't let me take the day off anyway. I had only ever called off one other time working for this company, over a year prior. Reluctantly, I had to go in, anyway. I started to bleed very heavily about halfway through my shift. I mean, very very heavily. I've never seen anything like it. It was running off my legs, I'm SURE the guests could tell. I was very visibly upset, of course. I was losing a baby I wanted very much, and I was so embarrassed that my boss would NOT let me leave. We weren't even very busy, she just wanted to be cruel. After trying to clean myself up in the bathroom for the 4th time in 45 minutes, I decided I wasn't going to be treated like this any more. I called my boyfriend to come get me, and I went home. I blocked every number related to the job in my phone. I went home, and sobbed uncontrollably for days.

Coming out of this, I don't know how to proceed. I'm incredibly depressed, both by losing my baby, and job-hunting, knowing my chances for any job now are bleak. I know it's THE MOST irresponsible thing to do to quit like that, but I felt like I had no other option. They were abusing me. They did not care about me as a person, and I do not regret it. I'm only worried about what my boss is going to say to any new employers that contact her, because she isn't afraid to give a nasty reference, for even pettier things. This was only my second job, so I can't just not use it and have a 2 year gap on my record. What should I say at an interview about why I left my job? I know it isn't right to ever bad-mouth a company, but they seriously treated me bad and that made my decision to leave.

I think I have about ten to fifteen years before I get noticeable symptoms, which are uncontrolled muscle movements, loss of memory, difficulty speaking and general loss of control over my body and loss of brain power and eventually death. Essentially it is brain cells dying that are not meant to die, and there is no cure. It's already killed my grandfather and my mother is in the grips of it now It's the hardest thing I've ever had to cope with. It is possible to take a genetic test to find out if you're a carrier, which I did a while back and tested positive. It is a dominant gene, which means that I will definitely get the disease - it's just a matter of time.

Before getting tested, I didn't really think that it would change my life if I got a bad result. But it's changed everything, except for the fact that I'm still single (hah). My whole world crumbled and I quit law school and got a dog. I thought that I would get clarity if I knew that every moment was precious, but all I have is insecurity about making the right choices. There's so much pressure to do the right things and live life to its fullest, but I don't know how. I don't want to regret anything but end up just doing nothing and regretting a lot of the things I do. The future doesn't motivate me at all, since all I see is me losing control and at some point committing suicide after one of my many rounds of crippling depression. I'm spiraling and I don't know what to do. I can't really tell people what's on my mind since the hospital doesn't recommend telling people about the gene (so I won't end up with a ton of people staring at me, looking for symptoms to start). I see why they recommend it, but it's so lonely to live this way. I know that it's normal to feel the way that I do when faced with what I face, but I'm not sure how many single people who live alone are doing this. If it wasn't for my dog I might have already killed myself. One day I think I will.

So that's me in my darkest corner, but I desperately want to get out of it and I'm hoping that someone out there has been through something similar. I need to bring joy and happiness into my life, but I don't know what to do. Taveling is out of the question since I don't have any money for it and can't afford to take time off work. I'm now studying nursing, which I'm hoping will allow me to get a job I like and the opportunity to work anywhere I want, and maybe finally learn to speak French properly. But motivation is so hard to come by. All I can think is that this degree is 3 out of 10 good years, and I'm studying full time, working more than I should and spending all the time I have left over either walking my dog in the pouring rain (atm) or in a fetal position feeling so fucking empty and alone. I have friends and family who love and support me, but I'm alone most days and it's easy to get lost in my own mind. I need a fresh perspective, and I've seen what the reddit community has done for other people bofore, so I'm really hoping there's someone out there who understands.

Also, I know I could be hit by a bus tomorrow or get cancer or something more immediate and that I should be grateful for every day that I have. I am grateful for the fact that my body is functional, I have more food than I need, a roof over my head and my beautiful dog. But - I still mourn the loss of my future, to not get to retire and have grandbabies, grow old with someone or just fall in love without feeling like I'm robbing them of their life if they choose me.
So, I've got a rare disease called Huntingtons disease (previously called Huntingtons chorea), or rather I have the gene that will one day manifest as the disease. I think I have about ten to fifteen years before I get noticeable symptoms, which are uncontrolled muscle movements, loss of memory, difficulty speaking and general loss of control over my body and loss of brain power and eventually death. Essentially it is brain cells dying that are not meant to die, and there is no cure. It's already killed my grandfather and my mother is in the grips of it now It's the hardest thing I've ever had to cope with. It is possible to take a genetic test to find out if you're a carrier, which I did a while back and tested positive. It is a dominant gene, which means that I will definitely get the disease - it's just a matter of time.

Before getting tested, I didn't really think that it would change my life if I got a bad result. But it's changed everything, except for the fact that I'm still single (hah). My whole world crumbled and I quit law school and got a dog. I thought that I would get clarity if I knew that every moment was precious, but all I have is insecurity about making the right choices. There's so much pressure to do the right things and live life to its fullest, but I don't know how. I don't want to regret anything but end up just doing nothing and regretting a lot of the things I do. The future doesn't motivate me at all, since all I see is me losing control and at some point committing suicide after one of my many rounds of crippling depression. I'm spiraling and I don't know what to do. I can't really tell people what's on my mind since the hospital doesn't recommend telling people about the gene (so I won't end up with a ton of people staring at me, looking for symptoms to start). I see why they recommend it, but it's so lonely to live this way. I know that it's normal to feel the way that I do when faced with what I face, but I'm not sure how many single people who live alone are doing this. If it wasn't for my dog I might have already killed myself. One day I think I will.

2 years after graduating high school and moving from my family I've been doing pretty much nothing, just going occasionally to the gym, having some shit job just so I had something to do.  Failed college twice. (after like 3 months both times) Did not make any new friends in that period of time, was just alone and miserable. 
I had money saved because I worked while I was in high school and 1-2 years after high school. 

I moved out from my family to a bigger town because there was nothing to do in the one in which I grew up.

I feel like I am on a good path at this moment because I made some changes so my life improved a bit but I  still can't sleep at night when I think how much I could achieve in those 4 years.

I just could not find the voice to share my emotions. I have really good friends in high school. And good I mean we share laughters and tears altogether before.

I feel similar to a burden if I start complaining. I have all these emotions bottled up in me and I don't know how I can let it out. Nothing. Nada.

My mother has priority custody of my brother, sister, and I. Rufus seemed nice at first, but it seemed as he got used to us he began to become more agressive. When we moved into his house, it was good for a short bit. Sadly, it didn't stay that way. He had begun targeting my brother and accusing him of doing things (such as eye rolling, talking back, etc.) . He would yell for about half an hour before he would stop. Rufus would tell my mother and belive him. My sister was never treated this way because he knew he couldn't yell ate her without getting shit on. My mother saw him as the man of her dreams. His behavior worsened. He began making holes in the walls, breaking tvs (6 i think), and having tantrums. My mother confronted him about it and he was pissed.

This is the first time that I'm posting on Reddit. I'm stuck in a rut and I desperately need some advice:

Basically one of my best friends is getting married in a couple of months and her wedding has been the most anticipated event for all of us friends because she's the first close person to get married. Plus we've known each other since we were like 4 or 5 so it's kind of a big deal. We've been talking about it ever since she got engaged and even with our tight schedules and budgets, we managed to take a short Bachelorette trip.

NOW, the dilemma is that every year my company has a conference abroad just for the Sales and Marketing departments. Last year I was nominated to be a part of the committee that plans and organizes this event so I got to visit Thailand. I have been nominated this year again and the company is taking everyone to Malaysia but.. This year the dates are clashing with the wedding. 

I know the obvious answer is to refuse and to attend the wedding but one of my concerns is that I am the only person from my department to be nominated so it's kind of a big deal that they even considered sending me (the owner of the company is super stingy so just the fact that he approved my name on the list is huge) which is why it's going to make me look ungrateful and maybe a little arrogant and/or disrespectful if I say no (and that too for a friend's wedding which doesn't seem like a solid excuse in the corporate world to forgo this opportunity). On the other hand, I barely travel. My first trip abroad was when my company took us to Thailand! So just the fact that this trip is 100% paid for (Ticket, hotel, meals, etc.) is a huge plus. I'll probably just have to spend money if I shop or for sightseeing or whatever.

I have no idea how to go about this situation. I feel so selfish even considering the Malaysia option but then I feel like I'm forgoing a really good opportunity to see the world and that too for free! Please help me out.

I've reached a point where I've become too efficient with this position. Over the past 3 years I've slowly but determinedly taken away various duties from my co-workers (with my boss's permission) to the point that my employer is now required to either hire a part-time temp or allocate my duties between 5 - 8 employees each time I leave for a week or more.

My problem? I'm literally completing all of my duties between 9 am and 12 pm each day and some days I literally have nothing to do at all. This is a problem when my regular shifts are 8 am to 5 pm, five days a week. And it's a problem when we're about to hit our slow season which means I'll have even less to do. I am bored to tears each day and I've lost all motivation and joy for this job. I tried talking to my employer about it but he said all that would happen is I'd get demoted to part-time and he legitimately does not care if he's paying me to just sit here and do nothing.

I do have a long-term plan to find another job but that's not going to be fully achieved for another year. How do I keep myself entertained in the meantime?

But January of this year I broke up with my fiance, and not to get into details but it didn't end well. This resulted in me getting quite depressed and going through some deep psychological difficulties. I've since recovered from it (mostly) but I find it has impacted my career deeply, financially crippling me. 

I work in a 'per hour' teaching job, which means I get money based on how many classes I get to teach, and every semester the classes are shuffled and redistributed. Of course, as you imagine, my workplace has taken advantage of this to make sure better performance = more classes, which means better pay. A logical motivator and I don't blame them.

I don't particularly care for money and generally try to earn just enough to get by and indulge in my hobbies occasionally. So this part of my job has never bothered me much. Problem is, while going through depression, my work quality dropped severely, causing me to get shuffled right into the bottom tier and losing a large percentage of my salary for this upcoming semester, and subsequently, the rest of the year. 

Now I've ran into the problem, no matter how I spin the numbers, I can't afford my rent anymore, and I'm struggling to find another (cheaper) apartment in time. But what's even worse is I have to show up for work, pretend everything is fine, do my job well, while all of this anxiety and terror is flowing through my body. Of course, I'm not looking for financial advice, I've got that covered already, but rather, on how to deal with my job, and keep my performance from dropping (again) when I feel like it (my job/boss) has just thrown me out to the dogs. Especially knowing that I'll likely lose my home in the upcoming months.

So, sorry if this isn't welcome here either, but if anyone can offer me any advice on how to proceed then that'd be appreciated. Copied and pasted the original post below. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure where to start with this one, but I'll give you some context first. I'm using a throwaway because I've posted too much identifying information on main. I'm also going to use fake names because I'm paranoid and you'll see why in a second. This is also going to be long because these events have all happened over a decade plus.

I met my girlfriend Chloe in 2008 through her boyfriend at the time, James. I bonded with James over shared interests and similarities in our upbringing. We were both really into gaming and climbing, we both grew up Mormon and later left the church, etc.

I really liked James. We played video games or climbed together twice a week, checked in through text daily, and he introduced me to his friendship group, including Chloe. I'd just moved to town and I didn't have any other friends or family I was still in touch with so it meant a lot to me. The thing about leaving the church is that you're sometimes cut off by your family and friends who are still in the church and that was the case with me, so you tend to form pretty close connections with other ex-members as a result.

Anyway, when I initially met Chloe, I didn't think much of her. I just saw her as my best friends girlfriend and nothing more. She was really friendly, but so was everyone else in the group, a lot of them being ex-mormon. Chloe wasn't.

Around a year after meeting James, he showed up at my place in the middle of the night wasted, with no shoes or socks on, and a big scratch across his face. I know I'm talking a lot about the church but it's relevant; when you leave you suddenly have a lot of freedom to experiment and it isn't uncommon for ex members to develop drug or drink habits out of binging to make up for lost time or to rebel or whatever. James was absolutely not that kind of guy. He'd drink a beer or two when we were hanging out but he was the kind of guy who'd sit you down for a talk about moderation if you seemed like you were going down a dangerous path with substances. Not to be interfering but just to see if you were okay- he was just that kind of guy. He cared, and he was cautious. He always said alcohol made him sick anyway.

So to see him slurring his words, hardly able to stand up, looking like he'd been in a fight was really unusual and really out of character. I helped him inside and he told me he'd left Chloe's place because she'd been acting weird. I said he could sleep on my sofa, but before he could get settled, Chloe showed up. She was calm and sober, and she asked to come inside. I didn't think anything of it, so I let her in. The second she got inside she sprinted across the room and jumped over the sofa to land on James and she just started hammering her fists down against his chest. It was 0 to 100, she was calm and polite one minute, and completely feral the second she caught sight of him. I pulled her away and threatened to call the cops, and she instantly calmed down again, apologised, and left. It was surreal.

James said he was fine and after talking a little, we just went to sleep because he wasn't that coherent anyway. The next morning I really struggled to wake him up. He was extremely disorientated and didn't remember anything at all about the night before. I know we had a conversation about how much he'd had to drink and he said he'd only had one beer. I know I didn't believe him and we had a conversation about that. I'm pretty sure we talked about moderation and coming to talk to friends instead of turning to substances if we're struggling etc. But I know he insisted it was just one beer and I know how much I doubted that.

We also talked about Chloe and her assaulting him, but he told me that it wasn't what it looked like and he'd done something awful. I asked what he'd done but he didn't want to talk about it. He just insisted that he'd done something awful and she was justified in attacking him. I didn't necessarily agree, but I didn't push the issue. I wish I had.

Everything went back to normal after that, but Chloe became pretty cold towards me which made things uncomfortable. I still saw James, but I noticed he was more subdued in those last few months. At the end of 2010, I moved across the country. I'd been in an LDR for a while and wanted to be closer to my partner. I stayed in touch with James for a while mostly through social media but it wasn't as big as it was now. We text occasionally too, on birthdays and holidays, but eventually his texts stopped coming. I do remember feeling bad about it but it was just one of those things. Not every friendship from your teens-early twenties survives. I stayed in touch with two people from that town but no one mentioned James to me and I just assumed he'd gone on to do his own thing when his social media profile went inactive.

In late 2015/early 2016 I moved back to town when my relationship ended. Literally within my first week I ran into Chloe. She was a completely different person and she didn't seem cold towards me at all, she was really happy to see me, and honestly by then I'd forgotten most of the weird stuff. I asked if she was still with James and she told me he'd moved back to his parents year ago. We swapped numbers and arranged to meet up for a drink.

Shortly after, I caught up with my friends from the old group Chloe, James, and I had belonged to. I mentioned that I was going out for drinks with Chloe soon, and they were all shocked she was still in town. They'd not seen her for years, and assumed she'd left with James. They told me that one day James just upped and left. His apartment was empty and he'd just ghosted them all. No one had heard from him since, but someone had heard he'd gone back to his parents, and someone else had heard he'd moved to Europe to teach English as a foreign language or some shit. I thought it was weird, but not unbelievable.

When I went out for drinks with Chloe, I asked why she'd ghosted everyone, and she said they'd never been her friends, they were James, and when he went home, people just stopped inviting her places. She said if they didn't make the effort, she wasn't going to either. It sounded fair enough to me. Shortly after that, we ended up getting into a relationship. One on one it turns out we've got a lot in common and have the same sort of edgy sense of humour, music taste, etc. It's actually insane that I didn't notice how much we had in common before and I've been really happy with her since.

We moved to a new state this year and we're building a life together. We've got a dog and we've been talking about marriage, kids, the whole package. Until recently, I've honestly been seeing myself with this girl for the rest of my life.

But here's my problem. Chloe has always made sort of uncomfortable jokes. She's the type of girl to jokingly say stuff like *I've killed before, you shouldn't test me!* and other obvious jokes, usually about taking no shit from men, etc. If she sees a story about a girl being cheated on for example it's always *I'd cut his dick off haha!*

I don't like that kind of tumblr girl humour, but it's her life, she's always seemed like she's kidding. Sometimes the jokes are directed at me, like recently I've started getting into following cooking recipes on YouTube. She's usually the cook in our house but I'm making more of an effort. She came home to find me cooking recently and joked that she was going to have to find a new way to poison me now.

The only time she's ever seemed serious was when I mentioned that an online friend had invited me to a pride month event. She lost her shit and accused me of sleeping with my male friend. I'm bisexual but we're online friend and we've only met in person twice- she was there both times- and regardless I wouldn't cheat. During this argument she said she was going to kill him if he ever came near our home again.

Other than that, nothing major. But two nights ago, her sister spent the night. I gave them some space to have a bit of a girls night, and ended up playing some games, talked to online friends, etc. At one point, I headed to the kitchen to get a drink and passed the living room. I stuck my head in to say hello and see if they needed anything or whatever.

Chloe's sister joked that they'd just been about to send out a search party for me. Chloe then said ""God, not even James got a search party when I was through with him. All he got was an unmarked grave.""

Her sister looked a bit uncomfortable but laughed anyway. I left them to it, but the comment kind of made me think twice. She laughed afterwards, she'd been drinking, and she makes edgy jokes all the time, so I tried to convince myself that was it, but I couldn't help but wonder. So, I looked him up again. There are no new profiles, just the old profile I'm still friends with. He last updated in 2011, and it was to change his profile picture from one of him and Chloe to one of just him, so I'm assuming it was around their break up.

I also reached out to our mutual friends again, and all confirmed that they hadn't heard anything, that James just ghosted them one day around 2011 and hasn't been in touch since. One guy said he'd had plans with James the week he seemed to disappear, and he just never showed up. No cancellation or anything. Completely out of character; James was reliable as sin. Another friend directed me to his Mother's Facebook. She has a few public posts. One post at Christmas 2015 was a throwback photo of James with his sisters captioned *we're incomplete until he comes home!* Followed by her friends commenting to reassure her that James is probably fine, he'll come around etc. It could just be a typical ex-mormon becomes estranged from family situation, but most of us stay in touch or at least check in. There haven't been any posts about James since. I scrolled way down, and prior to 2011 there was a status saying she'd had a call with ""her boy"" in 2009 that made her happy, and I think James was the only boy, so it looks like he did make some contact. I found his sisters profiles too, and there's nothing about James, but one has a cover photo of some quote about the bond between siblings and the other commented ""*J :( x""* which maybe I'm reading into too much. I searched on every platform and couldn't find a mention of him aside from profiles and posts pre-2011; his surname is really unique so you'd think there'd be something.

So yesterday once her sister left, I told Chloe I was thinking of contacting James family to see if they'd heard from him. She got instantly defensive and asked why. I told her he was my best friend at one point and something didn't feel right about him disappearing without anyone hearing from him. She said she'd heard from him and he went back to his parents. I told her I'd seen his Moms Facebook and it didn't look like he'd gone home. She started to get upset, so I tried to calmly explain why I thought the situation was worth looking into but the more I talked the more distressed she seemed. She was torn between being tearful and being angry and when I said I was going to contact his Mom again she snapped and grabbed my shirt to back me into the wall. She's usually really calm but I honestly didn't recognise her. She looked like a different person. She told me that I didn't know what I was digging up and I'd regret it if I kept looking. I asked her to let go of me and step back, which she did.

I asked her to explain what had gone on between her and James. She said that shortly after I moved away, the relationship broke down after she realised James wasn't the person she thought he was. She said he'd done some bad things and she gave him an ultimatum that was essentially disappear, or she'd tell everyone what he'd done. I asked what he'd done but she refused to tell me.

Every time I push the issue, she gets upset. I slept on the sofa last night at her request and she's barely spoken to me today. I don't know what to do. James has never seemed like a bad guy to me. He was always supportive and genuine, the kind of guy you instantly warmed to. Chloe's the same, she's a warm person you just can't help but love, and she's only ever lost her temper once when she attacked James. Part of me thinks he must have done something to provoke that kind of behaviour in her. I know you shouldn't blame a victim for being attacked but knowing her I know it's out of character. And he told me that night he'd done something awful.

Obviously, my mind has gone to the most extreme place and I'm worried James has come to some harm. Her joke the other night and her reaction to my research as a result of her joke just don't seem rational in the slightest. I'd like to contact his family and try to locate him to be sure he's safe, but Chloe has told me she doesn't want me to do so because the way things ended greatly upset her and she now hates James.

What do you think? Am I overreacting? Should I look into his disappearance or respect my girlfriend's wishes? And how can I smooth things over if I am pushing at something painful for her? She seems genuinely upset with me.

TL;DR - I met Chloe and James when they were a couple. I moved away and lost touch with both of them. When I moved back, I started dating Chloe. We've been together nearly three years. My girlfriend jokes about murder a lot. She recently joked about murdering James specifically. I looked into his disappearance and realised he hasn't been heard from by anyone at all in eight years.

(We'll call him Ben) I have known Ben for years and we have been best friends through thick and thin, he's the closest thing I have to a brother and I mean it when I say he truly is a good person. Last year I went to visit him after he moved away from my town and he told me he had a 13 year old girlfriend and since he was 18 at the time, he asked me to refer to her as 16 to anyone else (Legal consent age). I agreed. I wasn't fond of what he was doing, but I promised that as long as things didn't go sexual and they kept it strict until she was 18, that I wouldn't say anything about it. 

Yesterday I visited him again and he's now living with her and they sleep in the same bed. I instantly got scared, but kept my cool having trust in him that he would do the right thing. Eventually he joked about this little chest he had on his shelf saying ""You don't want to see what's inside"" while laughing. Me thinking it was something stupid, I opened it up to find many, many condoms. Does he think this is a joke? I can't look him in the eye the same way knowing he's an adult who is sleeping with a 14 year old girl and sees no problem with it. 

He claims to be against pedophilia and says he's not as bad as others he's seen.

I actually and legitimately fell in love with someone, someone who I thought felt the same way. We dated for a little less than a year and then she came out as gay and it kinda broke me in two. Then she told me that she was sick of all the rumors going around and that I should tell people the truth when they ask me why we broke up. So I did and she has no recollection that she ever said that, and has refused to acknowledge my existence for the last 3 months for outing her (her life is fine I should add, she got lots of support when she came out and those people all hate me now...). People weren't exactly surprised seeing as she shaved her head and dyed her hair purple and started holding hands with her new girlfriend in public... and yes she accused me of being the one to out her AFTER this happened.

So basically... I'm on summer vacation right now and I have a month until I go back for my final year of high school. And I'm really really scared. Being in the same room as her makes me want to actually die because honestly, I still care about her kind of a lot and she hates my guts. She also makes a point of socially ostracizing me and just... watching her be popular and loved while I'm in a social gutter of being ""that asshole who outed \[girls name\]"" is just a little bit too much for me. Her replacing me with a new girlfriend is a bit too much for me. I totally respect her sexuality and her right to not want to be with me, thats not what this is about. Its about that I just want to be able to be in a room with her and not want to burst into tears. I want to not spend my summer vacation dreading seeing her. I want to not miss her because she was my best and only real friend. If I could, I would just never see her again but I don't have that option.

During my senior year of high school, I met this girl, lets call her ""E"". She was a sophomore at the time, and we had a pretty difficult class together at the time. I think we hit it off strong, there was a Halloween dance that was cheaper if you went with someone, and she seemed pretty bummed out that no one had invited her, so I did being nice, at the time I didn't really think much of her. During the dance, which was the kind of event where you went and just hung out with friends at a table while the DJ did his thing, E spent the first hour or so with her one friend she found, and then sat alone for about ten minutes before I found her. I can't remember what I was doing, probably taking pictures with people, I went as Donald Trump and got into a mock fight with a Hillary. After that, I found E, took her by the hand and over to the table with all of my friends, and the rest of the night was pretty great. It's important to note that E is pretty introverted, and someone who seems kind of unsure in how she'd like to express herself. One day she might dress and act goth, the next she's in bright colors and extremely outgoing. So, I think when I took her hand, I might have made a mistake, or flustered her, or something. In the beginning she barely talked to me, and the rest of the night we were almost inseparable. Nothing of major note other than hand holding, but I was pretty happy, considering I'm kinda beta.
After the party, and I'd say into the months following into December, we were constantly texting, and talking in school when we could. Nothing super important; just small talk or about things she enjoyed or heard about, I was just happy I had someone to talk to. It was probably around this time I started to ask her if she wanted to hang out outside of school, in which she was normally busy, aside from studying in the public library. I can't remember when this next part happened, but sometime between Christmas and February, E told me that if I was catching feelings, that she wasn't interested, and just wanted to be friends. At this point, I was pretty much obsessed with her, but played it off as if I hung out or offered to with everyone I knew, like a typical beta cuck.
Months past, and I think I didn't do much to help my case in class. I'm somewhat conservative, and the class was all girls aside from myself. Needless to say, there were some conflicting opinions, and I stupidly would voice what I had to say whether it made people mad or not. I've always told people what I've thought if they ask, I hate being fake. it also happens that I really suck at arguments, since I don't drop things until either they or I apologize or at least recognize the other persons standing and let them know about it. I probably pushed some things to far, and it seemed like E didn't even want to be my friend anymore after a while. I graduated, summer pasted, and I'm now in my second semester of college. E recently got into a relationship, and then dipped out of it after who knows what, but considering I know both E and the ex, it was probably because they were too awkward to hold a conversation. I've held my feelings for E all this time, and I saw her today in the gas station while since I'm home on Easter break. I was thinking about the Lab report I have, and forgot to say hi. I messaged E afterwards apologizing for not saying anything, and I got a pretty, lets say blunt, response, something that I'd send to someone if I didn't want to talk to them, but didn't want to be rude and say outright.

So we don’t really talk about anything . And he’s been doing this for the past month now , spending 12 hours a day on the video game. And when I ask him to go to the store with me it’s because I want to hangout with him but he would rather sit on the game with his friends . 

When I bring up him playing the game too much he’s started by sucking his teeth and tells me don’t start . Or “oh my fucking god I can’t do shit “ Or when I try to talk to him about something he said that hurt my feelings he always makes it about him by saying “ I’m not doing shit to you “ . And then I shut down because I don’t want to make him mad because that alway results in a screaming match and then calling each other horrible names . 

But I’ll also take fault in us not communicating . I’ll have a attitude and it would be towards him and he’ll get mad at me because he knows I’m
Mad about something . Instead of him addressing the problem I always have to do it resulting in an argument like usual . 

The only thing I can talk to him about is , video games , Facebook memes , and something related to his favorite movies , or a meme he shared on Facebook that he found funny. We could never talk about actual feelings and how either of us feel because he gets offended easily and shuts down and calls me crazy or calls me a bitch.

I ended up doing so and I'm terrified by what I've seen. 

He says that women have no respect for men they don't find sexy, and that we either make them a ""beta orbiter"" who acts like our slave in a futile attempt to get laid, or we hate them. So I'm thinking ""What about me?"" Does he see himself as my beta orbiter? Because I've never found him remotely sexy, but we've been friends for a long time and I can't imagine what I've done to him to make him feel disrespected. 

He says that no woman genuinely earns a paycheck and that any woman with a job is there to fill a quota. We work together! This can't possibly be what he thinks, but he said it more than once on different subs. 

He thinks that women who have slept with a lot of men can be recognized by a ""thousand cock stare"" which basically just looks like psycho eyes based on pictures used as examples. I don't know how many women have had a thousand cocks anyway, but I doubt this is a thing.

Then he also complains that women are never honest about how many males they've slept with. Why would you even want to know? Unless you care, which seems misogynistic. I'm not denying myself pleasure so whoever I end up with in the future feels more special sleeping with me. 

There was a post that was obviously about me where he talks about a ""female friend/coworker with big tits"" (not to toot my own horn) who he ended up in the ""friend zone"" with after failing to seduce her. He chalks up his failure to him not being aggressive enough when I ""played hard to get."" 

That post bothered me so much. I didn't ""play hard to get"" with him. I never do with anyone. I just wasn't interested. I was thankful that he wasn't overly aggressive to me, and it's why we were still able to be friends.

Once I was in therapy for a few months, my parents and I got into an argument and they asked why I was acting so different towards them, I told them that my therapist basically told me to stop holding back the things I really want to say to my parents because I've always been practically scared of them. They hated the idea that I was talking about them with my therapist. Mom was so furious that she made my dad call the therapist and ask what I had been saying about them. After the therapist obviously refused to discuss my sessions with my dad, he just told me that I wasn't going back because it was too expensive. 

I played devil's advocate and hoped that maybe it was just too expensive. But the way our insurance works is that you get 3 free sessions in a calendar year. So when the new year came around I got really brave and I asked if I could go back and dad said no. He wouldn't even look me in the eye and he mumbled about it being to expensive and stormed out of the room before I could even respond. 

I'm getting desperate. My mental health has declined drastically in the last year. I think I've always had OCD but I just never knew what it was. It feels like ever since learning what OCD really was this year, it's gotten worse. I have no idea how to cope with it. I know that mom won't understand, she gets mad any time I express any type of worry even though she knows I have anxiety.

Mom and I have never ever gotten along. Our relationship is practically non existent other than the fact that I live with her. I have a hard time discussing my health in any way with mom because she's a nurse and she seems to have the mindset that ""the patient is always wrong"". I got bitten by a dog once and asked if she could give me a tetanus shot and she refused insisting that "" we don't give tetanus shots for dog bites"" and only reluctantly gave it to me after I had a literal panic attack over it (which I later learned was all tied into my OCD). 

I had a doctors appointment made for this week for a cough and mom wasn't able to come with me so I was hoping that maybe I could ask my doctor about my options with therapy/counselling or whatever. But mom rescheduled to a time where she could come with me and I don't know why. I'm 23 years old, I don't need her there. I don't want her there. 

I have no idea what to do. Every single day is worse than the one before. Every few weeks my OCD shifts and I worry about something new. It's like once I stop worrying about one thing, my brain finds a new thing to worry about. It never stops. OCD has stopped me drinking tap water for nearly 4 months now, and I'm scared to shower. I'll go through a huge bottle of hand sanitzer in a week. Leaving the house has become so difficult that I refuse to even try anymore.

So this is where I need advice.  Where do I go?  I believe I've limited it down to two areas.  I've always wanted to live in Colorado (I'm more of a mountain person rather than a beach bum), or in the Washington D.C. area (Virginia or Maryland.  Cost of living is WAY too high actually in D.C.).  For me personally they both have pros and they both have cons.  On the same note, I've always dreamed of living overseas.  I did a study abroad in London during college, and I've visited England several times.  I'm a self professed Anglophile.  Of course I'm always open to other suggestions as well.  Is there someplace else that I should consider?  I have two dogs that I absolutely refuse to give up, so I have to take that into consideration as well.  

I'm just completely directionless right now.  I had the worst holiday season I've ever experienced.  I've literally been sitting around the house for a couple of weeks now.  I have no idea what to do, and I think the first step to pulling myself out of this black hole is figuring out where I want to go.  After I figure that out I can start looking for jobs, packing, and getting the house ready to put on the market.  I can also start looking for places to live wherever I decide to go.  At least then I will have a direction and I can begin the healing process.

It took us 6 months to find a suitable place this time just due to the tough rental market. Where we live, tenants need to be given at least 60 days notice when landlords want to sell the house.

So on Saturday (mid April), my landlord tells me they got on offer on the house for May 31, and ask if we can be out by May 30. At this point, they can only legally give us notice for July 1. Now, I was right in the middle of exams at that point, super stressed, so let her know that I’ll try my best (and I meant that), but will get back to her after my exams are done (Tuesday). 

Well, I receive a series of very pushy text messages, trying to urge me to accept, because then “the showings will be done” (I don’t mind the showings that much so I don’t know why they thought this was a big bargain for me.) I took a decent chunk of time that was supposed to be spent studying to send in inquiries to a couple of rentals, but most weren’t available until July 1. Eventually, I sent a message back explaining all of the things I need to look into before I consent (new place to live, wtf do I do between May 30 and June 1 since that’s a weird move out day, I need to rent moving trucks, not to mention I’m graduating and don’t know what city I’ll be living in so I shouldn’t be signing a year-long lease anywhere), I explained that I spent a large portion of the day looking into this for her, and I don’t have time right now but will absolutely try my best. Again, I asked until Tuesday.

The next morning her husband shows up at my door and says a whole bunch of nasty things, like 1.) the house will never sell with us here (we keep it VERY clean, have gone away several weekends so they can have open houses, and houses sell all the time with tenants in them... with 60 days notice), 2.) they’ve been such good landlords and always respond to maintenance requests (and I pay rent, that’s my job and maintenance are theirs where we live... also they haven’t responded to *every* maintenance request), and 3.) that we’re being unreasonable (for wanting more than 1 day to secure a place to live while I’m in exams). Okay. 

I lost it at the “unreasonable” part. I dealt with a number of improper entries when they were having the whole house painted. I would come home to people in my house, with no notice, having moved around my personal stuff (dirty laundry, bras, prescriptions) when I’m supposed to have 24 hours notice. Or I would come home and they’d taken it upon themselves to lock my dog up for hours without water. I let them remodel the kitchen and ate food from the microwave for 3 weeks. Some major appliances included in my lease (ie. AC, the dryer) have died and I didn’t kick up a stink. I could have gone to our landlord and tenant board and gotten a decent chunk of cash and didn’t, because I like to keep the peace.

I listed these to him and he shoved an agreement to end the tenancy at me and tells me I need to sign it today and storms off. 

I send a massage to my landlord explaining how unfair this was since I was in exams, was only asking for a couple of days, and I could have just said no. 

She sends a half hearted apology, says it’s been stressful for them too, and says she still needs the papers signed.

I know I could have put my foot down, but I was able to convince a friend to rent out his basement apartment to me cheap. It’s a huge downgrade from my living situation now, but there’s no year-long lease. In my opinion, greed showed their true characters, and I didn’t want to stay anyways, so I texted them that I’d move out.

I’m not looking for legal advice. Ironically, I’m a law student who volunteers for legal aid and I know that I could go after them for the above-mentioned incidents. But that’s not really what I’m interested in.

I feel like they’re horrible, selfish people, who got off too easy here. Maybe I’m looking for some r/pettyrevenge ideas here, or maybe I’m hoping someone will find the words I want to say to them. But something just isn’t sitting right with me, because I think they believe they acted appropriately and feel like victims of tenant protection laws... because 60 days notice is just so burdensome I guess.

Any ideas?

She smokes in the kitchen, this is a room that i have to use a lot, making my own meals and other things like this. We live in a small apartment and my bedroom is right next to the kitchen.

I also have to mention that i cant change her, I have tried and tried. Given her e-Cigs, showed her multiple studies on how 2nd hand smoking is just as bad as smoking. asked her to smoke outside.

I barely talk to the people who I used to spend my life with. I mean, once every couple of weeks and nothing very deep. I've never been someone with a big circle of fiends, maybe 3-4 close friends at a time. I also tend to grow distant from my friends when in a relationship, and I got married about 2 years ago.

 I thought I was feeling shame/guilt/loss for my current situation, but now I think maybe it's just society's pressure to have friends that has me feeling that way? I am 27, happily married, a home owner, and comfortable with money. Currently taking time to save/travel before my husband and I truly settle down and have kids. I fear that I can't relate to people my age. They're all looking for love or working on their careers or trying to find themselves or being a carpool parent or hustling to afford rent. Aside from this friend problem, I really have no problems, nothing to vent or relate about. The idea of getting drunk and staying out late like I did just a few years ago is very unappealing now, but so is getting coffee in the morning or doing yoga or getting brunch. Socializing feels like a task, I have one good friend who I enjoy talking to but everyone else I keep up with is just out of the fear of being isolated.

Are social networks making me feel shame for something I truly don't care about right now? I have to admit, seeing past friends post pictures with tons of other friends gives me a little pang of shame. My husband also has a LOT of friends, which makes me feel like a reject for having only 1 or 2. In the future when we do have children, I hope to know the neighbors wherever we move and the other moms at school and form friendships with people who have things in common with me, people to 'do life with'. Right now, I feel like there is no one that is on the same page as me enough to truly do life with me, besides my husband. Is it okay for me to let go of these negative feelings about my lack of friends until I'm at a more relatable place in life? Should I suck it up and keep trying to make new friends/stay connected to people i've drifted from even though the socializing part is a pain?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Suddenly realized I've drifted very far away from all of my friends and we are now different people. I want friends who can relate to me in the future, but socializing currently feels like an unnecessary burden. Is it okay to stop holding onto these friendships/trying to make new friends?

Some background: I work in the health care field. Our profession (like many others) relies on exact precision as to not cause permanent harm to other.

We realized he wasn't getting it, so we all took turns trying to teach him hoping someone else's teaching style would work. He just couldn't do it. We rotate the students to our different centers every month or so. I spoke to his program director and asked if he has had this issue else where. She said no. Turns out he did, but people tried to do him a favor and passed him anyways. 

He took this experience and went around saying we are racist. He is a black man, being trained primarily by a black man, Indian man and a white woman. Are problem wasn't his race. It was him not being able to do the job safely. 

Now he is an employee at our main hospital and applied for a transfer to our site. He was rejected due to his (undocumented) history of racism accusations. He in turn told the director that we wouldn't take him bc his race and that we have a history of ""hassling him"" and down grading him due to it. They didn't want to deal with any backlash and approved the transfer over more qualified employees.

I've always been on the road by myself.

Unfortunately, an old friend of mine was being physically abused by her boyfriend and decided to leave. I drove an hour and a half to pick her up in the middle of the night. I'm guessing that I was her only option to get her out of the situation at the time. 

I helped her get a phone and a plan since her boyfriend cut hers off, I've fed her and tried to help as much as I can. I'm trying to be the best possible friend I can, even considering my limited circumstances. 

I have asked multiple times if she wants to go elsewhere or contact someone she can stay with but she doesn't seem motivated to want to leave. 

I'm okay with that.

The other thing I will mention here is that we are currently in a northern US state where it is freezing currently and we have had our first snow just last night.

Except, because I've been a bachelor male and flying solo for such a long time... I'm not used to having female company with me. Although sleeping close for body heat is a great idea... I'm still a guy who has had little to no contact with a female in a long time. 

It's all kinds of awkward boner-ville up in this van...

I have become extremely uncomfortable in my own ""home"". I've been having extremely vivid sexually themed dreams and I'm trying to be as respectful to my friend as I possibly can in this situation.

I’ve been experiencing downfall for as long as since late 2015. Although some times it’s normal, I’m no where near as I use to feel about my self. And there have been some extreme instances where I’d be into deep depression. 

I’d want to start right now but I have exams within 2 months. I’m taking a gap year which will mostly consist of self improvement and more time for rests. 

I notice since my downfall that I don’t really accept my self for who I am, I always set my self unrealistic expectations of my self that’s dosen’t seem possible I’m the given circumstances, some tasks seem so extremely hard to start etc. 

I’ve been going gym for a year or so. I’ve gained weight due to increase food intake, as I’m powerlifting. I do miss having cheekbones so I hope to change my workout plan a bit. 

Although I do go gm regularly I don’t necessarily feel happy with my self mentally as I feel I’m lacking in other things about my self, so I want to know other things I can do to make me love my self in which affect other people from being able to accept me so I don’t want to continue to feel sorry for my self anymore and actually just feel happy.

First time poster, long time reader. So I [24 soon to be 25] went on a small trip to see some friends and just hang out. There was a lot of good, but also a lot of bad and frustration (not only on my part). During this trip, I got something of a crush on my friends' friend, which is a whole different can of worms, that I will more than likely bring up in a different post. Part of my trip included 8 hours to and from a locale, which was only accompanied by me, myself and I, which allowed for a lot of outward singing, but also self-reflection. 

I get really anxious sometimes, and my mind starts to wander. Even before this trip, I've been making an effort to improve myself (volunteering for a local sports team, reading more books [1984 is great, by the way!], experimenting with different music, going to the gym, taking steps to get my boating and motorcycle license, and overall just trying to be more positive and supportive, etc.), but now that there's a girl I want to woo, I have a bit more at stake than just doing it for my own well being. We have another group trip planned in a little over a year to Germany, and I want to really be able to turn heads, even amongst my friends. 

Y'know those people you just inherently want to be around? Like, their confidence and suave just makes them super likeable and you just want to learn more about this person? You want that person on your team. That's what I want. Clearly my friends like me for me, but I want to grow into that type of person while maintaining my identity.

So in saying all of that, what were some things that you did that your friends or SO noticed, in a positive way? Or rather, the people you admire, what traits and why? What hobbies do they do, or experiences they have that makes you interested?

TL;DR: How are you becoming a person people admire? What is super interesting that you see in other people?

I'm afraid to cause waves, but something needs to be done.

Me - 23m, been working with this company less than 2 years.

Boss - 50-something man, VP of the company, strict and seems unapproachable besides emails.

Jake - 65m (more or less), elderly coworker and lazy piece of garbage, been with the same company his whole life.

I am a relatively new hire and I have been paired up with old Jake, so essentially everything we do is as a team. You know how you'd have lazy assholes doing nothing and getting all the credit in high school group projects? Jake is that dude on steroids. He's essentially counting on the fact Boss is almost never around to jack-shit and make me do all the work. If there's a testament to his lack of work ethic, it's that despite being a newbie, I have become his unofficial manager, and he won't do a task unless I seek it out for him and drop it on his desk. That being said, even if I DO drop the task on his lap, there's a good chance he won't do it either; he's the kind of coworker who looks you in the eyes and says ""no, I don't want to"" without a trace of shame or self-awareness, even if he's currently playing a fucking browser game.

The thing is I am virtually certain Boss has no idea how little work Jake really does. EVERY TIME there is a difficult task that requires expert skills, Boss sends it by mail to Jake... and Jake just forwards it to me. Jake cannot access the back office of our website (because he always refused to learn), despite a significant portion of our work being there, and he's so set in his ways that he is the only person in the entire company using a PC instead of a Mac, so a specialized software we need cannot run on his computer at all, and I do 100% of all the work related to both. Yet, Boss still asks Jake to do all tasks related to the back office and the software - since all the tasks end up completed (by me), I've eventually come to the realization that Boss thinks Jake is the one doing all of it. Another thing is that the first person to see a ticket is credited as the main person working on it, and Jake opens every ticket, signs them then closes them without completing them - I am the one actually doing the work, but I'm just credited as the person who gave them a second look. During a company outing at a bar, one of the rare occasions when we see Boss in person, he loudly congratulated Jake for doubling his numbers in the past year, but Boss didn't say a single word to me that day.

The main issue with the current situation is that Boss makes me do all the menial tasks, as he thinks Jake is the brains of the operations doing all the complex, important ones. I work about 55 hours a week (last week was harsh and I easily worked 70+ hours), but we don't clock in and the boss is almost never physically in the office, so he doesn't know. Jake arrives at work around 10 am and is gone by 2 pm at the latest. Since we're paid in salary, he makes easily 50% more than me for doing just a fraction of the work I do. Even when he's around, he barely does anything - he's got a task he does every Wednesday, for instance, that he claims takes all day so he'll refuse to do anything else. He misses enough days for me to cover his Wednesdays numerous times, and I know from experience that this task doesn't take more than 20 minutes. Doesn't stop Jake from pretending to work on it all day then complain about how difficult his one tiny task is.

The last nail, I found, is how outspoken Jake is about refusing to work. He digs his heels in the ground and puts more effort towards avoiding a task than he'd exert just completing it. For example, I have to send out a newsletter, which takes about 25 minutes every single day (it's menial work, as Boss still thinks I'm the new hire who can't handle real work) and I started training Jake to do it so there can always be someone in the office to do it. But a few days later, Jake triumphantly told me to stuff it and that he complained behind my back to Boss about me trying to ""pawn off"" my work onto him, and Boss told Jake he didn't have to do the newsletter and that he should be focusing on more important tasks. Now, I cannot even take days off (or I have to work on my days off) because I have to do that stupid newsletter every single fucking day of my life. Jake takes days off out the wazoo and I always do his job on top of mine without complaints, but the one time I asked for one day off, on Christmas, he freaked out. He started by going to Boss and requesting that I'm not allowed to even take a single day off; when his request was rejected, he was making the rounds in the office trying to find someone else to cover my job because he couldn't bear the idea to actually do real work even once. Nobody agreed. On the day I was out, he just didn't show up and the work went undone. The next day, we were both disciplined, and my day off (approved long in advance, within my rights and literally the first day off I ever took with this company) was treated as if it were as bad as Jake's no-call no-show.

I'm quiet and shy, and I hate making waves. I tried all the possible mental gymnastics to tell myself the situation was fine - he's going to retire soon, I'm just out of university and should stay in my lane, etc - but I reached my boiling point. I need to come forward to Boss and do something to end this situation. But I'm really afraid (What if Boss just doesn't believe me because of Jake's seniority? What if Jake is just given a stern talking to, and it causes bad blood and retaliation from him against me?) and I don't know how to go about it. My boss also seems really unapproachable; he's rarely in the office, when he's around he's either locked up in his office or walking around with that intimidating aura that says ""If you talk to me, you had better make it worth my time."" Jake obviously has no qualms running to Boss to complain and snitch on me, but it's so different from my usual personality that I'm frozen and unsure how to proceed...

I started playing football in 7th grade a little late for most kids .... most kids started when they were 4 or 5 but anyway I wasn’t very good but I enjoyed it and wanted to start so I continued and played in 8th grade and this continued all the way till current me in 11th grade . And I still have not started a single game in all my years of football , I’d classify my years like this 7-9 grade learning years .... these years I wasn’t very good and was still acquiring skills and becoming more athletic . I loved football so I started working out and training  to get better I got my first gym membership after 8th grade season going into jv and started to increase my strength and athleticism and then going into 10th I improved a lot athletically..That last year on 10th grade JV I had my most enjoyable year I was in the discussion to start I ultimately didn’t but practice was fun I was trying to compete for a spot and was working hard I loved trying to get the spot and throughout the season I improved even more and at the end of the season the coaches told me I might be able to contribute next year on varsity where I currently am ... so after the 10 th grade season I hired a athletic trainer I loved going the facility and training and getting better and at this point I’ve become very athletic maybe not the most athletic at my position but definitely can compete with my positional teammates ( I play wide receiver ) .... anyway summer starts and we start having offseason workouts camps and such I’m doing well I enjoy it for the most part .... some practices suck especially when they get too two a days , but I endured it and during that time the varsity coaches were impressed with me getting better since I’d make plays in practice and they were telling me I could maybe get on the field if I keep balling out ... so I liked to hear this and still liked playing for the most part .... but slowly throughout the season so far the last three weeks too a month I’ve been falling out with my sport ... it’s a grind practice during the school year is rough ... I wake up at 6:20 go to school from 7-2 then wait in the school until film practice at 3-4 then field practice from 4-7 once I get home I’m in bed an hour or two later so I have a long day and on top of that practice is stressful .... I mean we get screamed out cursed at etc and when we condition it’s sucks .... now I know a lot of fellow athletes go through this it’s just sports so all this I common but it’s a lot harder to go through all this when you lose you passion for the sport especially when it eats up the majority of your day .... know I don’t know if I’m staring to fall out with my sport because I just out grew it or something like that or maybe I’m just burnt out from playing years and years never starting but constantly working hard and no results to get on the field ... especially this offseason with the trainer idk I dread going to practice i dread when coach tells us to start running and then we do it until we are literally about to pass out or when your scared to make a mistake or fuck up because you’ll get screamed at or make the team run.... I try to tell myself just push through the seasons not that long ( it ends give or take a couple weeks nov 1 ) i also know if I play my senior year I’ll finally start and play .... and I know most of my teammates don’t like  practice as well but they seem to just push through until game day where they can have fun  since they start 
( and also don’t get me wrong I knew the feeling of not wanting to go to practice but this is different I really just hate it ) the kids that start love game days and I’ve always wanted to start and I know I will next year but I don’t even know what playing in a game feels like I question myself if playing for another year and half is worth it just play in game since I don’t even know what it’s like . This was kind of a rant so I’m sorry... it’s all so confusing too me I just feel burnt out and I don’t know what to do



Edit : I even faked and injury sort of I actually hurt myself to not practice  I said I pulled my hamstring and I just kind of beat the fuck out of my hamstring when I got home so I would limp and it would bruise but while i sat on the sideline i kind of wanted to practice again after a couple days I missed running routes and catching balls but definitely didn’t miss the running and screaming but once I came back the excitement was very short lived within I think a week maybe week and Half I couldn’t handle practice again and made more excuses to miss I was sick but exaggerated it but making myself throw up so my mom would let me stay home .... adding this in here

Some were designed to see how connected you were with reality, some your levels of anxiety, some possible ADHD, some paranoia or personality disorders. I am intimately familiar with such assessments, I've taken many in the past. To be honest the connotation of most of the questions left me feeling that if I told the truth I'd be considered a poor fit and would not be hired. Asking if I feel tired, hopelessness, whether I feel others treat me unfairly. I felt kind of attacked. I know getting and keeping a job can be really hard for someone with anxiety and depressive disorders, but this place seemed like they were filtering them out altogether. I need this job, but I'm not sure if they'd be very accommodating towards my illnesses.

My SO [25M] and I [25F] have been together for nearly 7 years. For the last year we have only been seeing one-another every weekend/second weekend due to the different cities we work in. We live about 2 hours drive from one-another. He is currently at a job making double what I make and would easily be able to support both of us for a while. He would like me to quit my job (where I am very frustrated at), move to his city and look for another job whilst doing freelance work online. Honestly that's what I want to do as well, but when I talk to my parents about this they are very against me moving to another city without a job. 

I understand that I am an adult and must make my own decisions, but they are also much more experience in life and don't want me to make the wrong choice. My SO's parents are happy for me to be moving to his city, even if it means that we won't be able to visit them as much.

We plan on getting engaged this year and married next year (hopefully), so I would have to move there at some point. I am on a month-to-month lease and would also need to notify my landlord that I would be moving within a month. 

The big question is to move without a job and continue looking for one there, whilst my SO pays most of the bills (I would be able to pay my bills with my savings for a few months), or stay at my current job and only move down when I find a replacement?

My boyfriend and I met in high school in the midwest and have been dating since we turned 18. We then went away to college: me to NYC \(the place it has been my dream to live since I was 14\) and him to Arizona. We've been long distance throughout college really successfully and are more in love now than ever before. We are now seniors about to graduate. The plan has always been for me to move to Arizona once we graduate this May \(in about 6 weeks\) in order to close the gap and me for to stay there with my boyfriend for a year while he finishes up an extra year of college to get his graduate degree.

Here's the problem: as much as I want to be with him and as much as I love him, I'm desperate to stay in NYC. I absolutely hate the city where he lives\-\-it's boring, hot, and reminds me of the midwestern city I escaped when leaving for college. After nearly 4 years in New York I finally feel established in my friend group, I know exactly which neighborhoods I love, and I have a lot favorite places to go out to and things to I love to do for fun. It took me this long to get adjusted to living here and now I feel like I'm being prematurely forced to leave. I'm devastated that I'm abandoning what feels like my home and I'm really worried about starting over\-\-it's really important for me to have a group of friends, but it can be hard for me to make new ones.

In my perfect world, he would move to NYC with me this year\-\-but he's committed to finishing his masters degree in Arizona. I'm really worried that I'm going to move to Arizona and resent him for the entire time we live there or that I'll be really miserable there for the whole year. My boyfriend is the love of my life and we've talked about all of this before, but the closer we get to the moving date, the more I start freaking out about completely changing my life.

What should I do? Should I move to Arizona after all? Should I stay in NYC for another year while he finishes his degree and prioritize my own happiness? \(I think that may break his heart\)  Is there some sort of middle ground?

\*TLDR\*: I feel like I'm being forced to move to a city I hate in order to close the distance. I know in my head that I'm being selfish, but every time I think about actually leaving NYC and my life here, I start panicking because I love everything about my current life\-\-apart from being long distance.

I (16f) started casually talking to this guy (17m) for a few months, starting in May of this year. I definitely had a crush on him, but our friendship was completely platonic. I really enjoyed talking with him. We had a ton of things in common (sense of humor, music, etc) and he really opened up and discussed a lot of personal things with me. We live somewhat in the same area (30-40 minutes away), so we decided to hang out one night at a party we were both going to. I was expecting to just hang out with him in a completely casual way, but he started making moves on me and we ended up making out. 

Now I'm mature  enough to know that a kiss doesn't actually mean anything, but it still really got my hopes up with this guy. After that night, we continued to message regularly and he would occasionally send me flirty messages and say he wants to hang out again. This got me even more excited about this guy, even though we were still just friends. 

Slowly our conversations got shorter and shorter and now we rarely talk, if at all. It's pretty clear now that he's not interested in me at all, and probably never was. He's pursuing other relationships, which is absolutely fine since he never had any obligation to me. It just sucks because I genuinely really liked him. 

I'm just very confused. I really don't have a lot of experience with boys (he was my first kiss), so I'm finding it hard to understand why he would kiss me and act somewhat interested in me if he wasn't. I'm really embarrassed now about how excited and happy I was over kissing him. I feel so used. He probably just wanted someone to make out with and he saw me as an easy target. 

Now it sucks because I can't stop thinking about him. It's so hard to let go of the idea of him that I imagined in my head. I keep thinking that maybe if I was prettier, skinnier, etc, that he might of actually liked me. I keep thinking about the ""what if"" and the ""what could of been"".

So this post isn't about me it's about my girlfriend. Last August 2017 she couldn't attend school because of lack of funds so she took a semester off so that she could work and make enough money to afford the tuition. After 2 months of working two jobs she realised that she will not be able to afford to save money for tuition because she can barely cover her rent and regular expenses. (she's cut back on everything she can and still can only save about $200 a month).

We decided that she would just take out a school loan because her dad earns ""so much"" money she is not applicable for financial aid and also isn't prepared to give her any money (which is his choice but it pisses me off). But when she wen't to take out a loan for school she was unable to, her Dad couldn't cosign for her because he has bad credit. She has great credit and works 2 jobs but is only 19.

I don't know what to do she has literally been busting her ass working two jobs in one day to save enough money to afford rent next semester so she can cut back on work to save time for school. I want to start a gofundme but she keeps telling me no and I know it wont get anything if she doesn't share it. She only has 4 more days to get the money or she will be dropped from all her classes.

What should we do? She's just crying because she wants to go to school and I feel like shit I'm just lost can someone help?

My boyfriend’s best friend’s fiancé (Becca) has been making up stuff that I said and telling my boyfriend. She has said that I argued with her over our different music tastes (I didn’t - the conversation was very friendly and my boyfriend was there) and that I said I didn’t care about her career (not true).
She then told him that he was better single. She was really disappointed when he said I was in the way to join their night out. Then was very friendly to me when I arrived (at this point I didn’t know any of what she has been saying). She didn’t speak to me again the rest of the night and didn’t speak to my bf again after I arrived (but had been speaking to him fine before that). 
My bf told me all of this the next day. 

I met her friend the same night (Megan) and she said that she was surprised at how nice I was. When I asked her what she meant Megan said that she had thought I would be really stand offish and not friendly. Which indicates that Becca has been talking trash about me to her friends as well. 

I get along really well with Becca’s fiancé (my bf’s best friend) and he has no idea about any of this. My bf doesn’t want me to say anything to Becca about it because he doesn’t want to cause drama for his best friend which I fully understand. 

I have never done or said anything against Becca. We’ve never been close and I wouldn’t have considered her a friend but I have always been friendly. I had got the sense before that she didn’t like me and was doing/saying things to manipulate my bf against me but brushed it off because I thought I was being paranoid (thinking what real life person would act like they were in Gossip Girl). But now she has fully shown that my quiet suspicion was right.

My bf said he felt she was being a bit flirty with him and he felt a bit uncomfortable. This was while her fiancé was there. I don’t even understand why she would do that. 

I don’t know how I should react. Do I say nothing and rise above it? But then I’m worried that makes her think she can do it again. But I also hate drama and don’t want to have an argument.

At highschool and for the first year and a bit of university, I had mostly guy friends and one close girl friend who moved overseas. Because of this I always feel more relaxed around guys and get on with them much better - every party I've been to I always seem to get on with the guys and we sort of gravitate together? I had a study day for my course the other day and although my good friend in the course is a girl, I went off with the guys to get food and really enjoyed being around them and had a good talk with them despite not knowing them too well. 


I find guys are easier to joke around with and don't take most things as serious as girls.


A lot of guys I've dated have told me that I'm different from other girls they've been with and they like that I'm more laid back and enjoy a laugh. Not trying to sound special or up myself as I don't even know if its a compliment not being like other girls hahaha.


The problem is...starting when I started mixing at on campus parties and with guys in a course that has a solid core group with everyone completing the nearly all of same subjects of the entirety of their degree, I've run into a lot of issues and struggles and it's made me really sad.


Every time I've tried to be friendly and get on well with a guy just on the basis of being mates, they see it as an open invitation to pursue, harrass and ask me on dates in varyingly levels.


Two guys in my course, one I was ""friends"" with and the other I  was just friendly with asked me on a date and wouldn't let up asking me multiple times until I just stopped replying, one got angry and blocked me and the other saw it as a possibility to harrass me to sleep with him and take his virginity, ""I want to be mates I just want to hook up too""...really? Although he told me previously that ""he wasn't interested in being friends with girls"" which should have hinted at his immaturity. Which we weren't afterwards although he spent months yelling at my window at night once a week after going out drinking and stalked my insta on different accounts until I just stopped posting.

 He also used to be nasty and make horrible remarks about the only guy who has actually been a friend to me in the course and out and we met the sem before and changed degrees together.


The other was a guy in my course I thought was my friend and we used to study together and I'd help him with his other major as we both lived on campus and he seemed nice and like he genuinely cared about me asking me questions and being kind.


Well that all changed one night when he harassed me to come over and ""watch a movie"" with him in his room. I must have said no about ten times as I had a big face to face assessment the next day. After the tenth time he replied really passively with a ""👍"" and I didn't ever have much else to do with him except study for an exam a few weeks later.


Yet another instance, I was invited to a party with the best friend of one of the guys mentioned above and we had to sit on the floor under a blanket as it was freezing and tiny and he started feeling up my leg and ass and the other guy I met would message me to go on a date everytime he got drunk or high until I blocked him.


I also had a best friend from HS whom I met up with and hung out with one on one and with friends in our break (Hes at a different uni) and we had a great time going to the beach and a hiking spot/waterfall and for lunch. However, we shared a combined birthday bar crawl at the start of the year and slept on our friends lounge apart but when I woke up in the morning I was next to him with his hand on my leg and him touching my hair, even if he was still a bit drunk...idk


I've been asked for nudes so many times.


Tl;dr : its like every time I meet a guy and be friendly to them (I genuinely want some guy friends as I prefer them for some reason) they see it as me giving them an open invitation to pursue me romantically or offer their dick or talk about my body. I am paranoid whenever I see that look in their face when I meet a new guy and it increasingly leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
I don't get it because I wouldn't consider myself pretty, just average...I guess guys might see me as lower value and easier?



**Am I like a duckling raised by a hen that has identity issues and am I asking too much? Am I being too ignorant? Can men and women truly never be friends and is this normal?**


I do acknowledge that dating/hooking up is an expected or common part of the human experience especially at my stage of life but surely we can be friends as well? It's really eating away at me and making me sad that I can't be seen as the person I am and not for my gender and body.


My female friends keep going on with the old rhetoric, ""guys are trash and just out to screw you over"" and I've always denied and blocked it out.

My dad got me a job at the place he works, doing pipeline testing. The company is based on the other side of the country, and the jobs are scattered everywhere, so I could be sent to any state at any given time with no days off for who knows how long. So far since I started in late October 2018 I’ve gotten a total of 3 breaks, adding up to about 20 days home in total. I make pretty good money, to the point where I can kinda buy most of the things I really want and have the capacity to save up for the things I can’t buy. Even more, if I stay for a few years I have the opportunity to eventually be promoted to a superintendent, who makes $630 a day (including per diem.) that’s obviously pretty great pay, the job is VERY easy, I’m pretty good at it, I generally don’t mind a lot of the people there, and I get to work with my dad which is nice.

I hate it though. I can’t stand being away from home for so long, I have no hobbies that can transfer over to other states as my main hobby is making music, and I can’t bring most of the things I have in my “studio” with me. I’ve never felt such a longing for just being able to come home at night and actually do something I enjoy. When I’m working we get up early, come home late, and go straight to bed, which IMO is actually the easiest way for me to cope with it since I don’t have to sit and think about how much of my life I’m already wasting away. I miss my brothers, and my mom, and my friends, and my music equipment and everything that I enjoy being stuck at the house, whilst I’m out in the middle of nowhere purely working.

I have a plan kind of, my parents want to go in halves on a big piece of property where I can build myself a house and they can get themselves a house as well. We’ve been through quite a few struggles in the past and felt like having our very own space (whilst still having enough space in between our living areas to be separate from each other) would be the ideal living situation for all of us. My plan was to:

1.) Get my car paid off

2.) Get the house paid off (it’s actually a 2-story pole building with an apartment on top and a studio on the bottom)

3.)Get X amount of dollars in savings

4.) Gather up all of the expensive music gear that I’ll probably ever need (I have a list, and that list comes to like $40,000 for now, but obviously it’s gonna be a “get something here-and-there thing throughout the time I’m employed here.)

That’ll probably take me like 3 or 4 years. After that the only bills I’d have would be my half of the property payment (unless I decide to pay my half off too) and my utilities/insurance/phone bill. After that, I guess I’d quit and find a normal job that pays less but lets me have time at home to life a normal life. I just feel like people look at me funny when I talk about leaving this place. They always say “you’re young and you’re not tied down and you can travel and stuff” and I understand where they’re coming from, but I want to live an actual life, not dedicate 20 years entirely to this thankless company. Will I regret leaving?



TL;DR: I make great money at a company that has long term opportunities but I hate that I have to travel and sacrifice having a life with my family and friends to work here.

I drive a 1999 Nissan Quest and it gets (at best) 13-14 MPG. My friends and I make plans to go to the beach, the mall, target, etc and I pick them all up and drive them around and drop them off. 

I don't think I'm an asshole if I ask for gas money since I am a broke college student driving a gas guzzling car. The more I think about it, the more taken advantage I feel that they just take rides from me and don't offer anything in return (we go places a lot). I'm not asking for them to split the gas bill every time, but $5 here and there to help out would be appreciated. 

In HS I asked my friend for gas money to drive and I asked for $5 (this is the first time I asked). We were going to the beach which isn't very close and it was deep into the summer after I drove her everywhere else already. She then continued to calculate the distance I would drive with the gas prices at the time and my car mileage to get the EXACT amount of money she owed. After this, I was very hesitant to ask for more gas money since this was just uncomfortable to deal with. 

How I do ask my friends for gas money? They know how expensive gas is and how much my car uses and when they ask me if they can go places, I go with them. I'm not saying for them to ""pay to hang out with me"" (which is what I've seen a lot of online) but to occasionally throw me gas money for always putting the miles on my car and the time I spend picking them up and all the gas I use and pay for over and over for the past 3 years.

So I am 17, he's 18. We have lived together our entire lifes, but I feel like I don't know him and I don't want to. For some reason he HATES me. He has no friends, spends all his free time in his room playing videogames. At home he either ignores me completly (I do too now) or he insults me randomly for no reason. I am literally his target. It's his hobby to destroy my life I swear to you guys. He LOVES to see me cry and whenever he spots me crying (which I always try to hide since it's a little embarassing) he goes to my parents and makes fun of me because I'm crying. Even when it's about serious stuff. Let me give you an expample of how twisted he is. Once when I was about 12 I hit my head and bled a lot at our school. I had to be escorted to the school nurse and obviously I was crying. Randombly my brother and his friends (this was back when he actually had any) were in that area and when he saw me crying, bleeding from my head, surrounded by worried classmates and teachers, he started laughing and making fun of me (for all he knew I could have been dying btw, it was quite serious). 

He gets mad REALLy easily and has these tantrums if I say something slightly provocative. I have to be really careful around him because we have had physical fights before. He has called my names for the smallest thing like ""Pig"", ""whore"", ""idiot"" ect, and here is the weirdest part: whenever I try return whatever insult he has thrown at me he runs to our mom and tells on me immediatly as if he didn't just call me the same thing. It's mental. Whenever I confront him and say that he literally just insulted me he lies and acts like that never happened. He will defend things that he just did right before me ON HIS LIFE. Even if it's just the two of us present. And he will protect his dumb lies no matter what and I mean it. Exmple from when he were 13: He once wasn't supposed to play any games on his computer (to cure his addiction which he has to this day), but he did and i caught him. I told my dad about it and my brother wouldn't admit to be doing that even though his pc was running soundwise and was warm underneath which is proof that he was indeed using his pc. He SWORE that he didn't use it and it got to the point that my father smashed the pc and threw it out the window. (yeah the situation was that tense) He could have just told the truth and it wouldn't be a problem at all. If he had just admitted to using it, it wouldn't be a problem at all, but he repeatedly denied using it and ended up making one of the biggest quarrels in my family. 

He is my moms best friend and he is disqustingly fake-nice towards her. He uses artificial charm at everyone he meets and he's really socialy awkward. He doesn't quite know how to talk to people and he is overly well-behaved I guess. He behaves how he thinks people want him to but he's overly formal and tried to manipulate them into liking him. 

Ok this has been really badly structured and my english skills aren't the greatest but I want your opinion on this. Is he a psychopath? I tried hinting at it to my mom once and she got really defensive and mad at me, but I feel like she knows that something's wrong with him. She just doesn't want to admit it.

There are 3 people to a shift and we work 9-10 hour days 7 days a week (yes, every day)  The other 2 guys I work with on 3rd shift have been with the company in their positions for about 15 years now, and yet i'm the one who is responding to maintenance calls primarily and i'm constantly being called by them to come help with problems.  (I am new to the industry and graduated college less than a year ago)  

At my company there are two pay grades, S1 and S2, new hires like me are S2 whereas the other 2 guys are on S1 ($5/hr difference) I'm getting tired of making less and doing more so I schedule a meeting with my supervisor and maintenance manager to discuss a promotion to 3rd shift lead, after having a lengthy conversation with them about it they both agree and support the idea of me being the shift lead. The only things left to do are the manager needed to talk to HR and then HR needed to get one final confirmation from the operations manager. 

Yesterday the maintenance manager informs me he spoke with HR, and they say they'd love to have me be the shift lead...... in a year and a half from now. So basically, in order to be a shift lead you have to already be on S1 pay grade. In order to be on S1 pay grade, you have to pass an electrical test given by the company. However, they won't even let me attempt to take the test until i've been with the company for 2 years.

Should I go over everyone's head and speak directly to the operations manager about the issue and see if there's some workaround? Do I say fuck you to the whole company and find another job? Do I just continue on working how I am getting paid less than my coworkers with nothing to look forward to at work for the next 18 months?

I[M18] have not been close with my group of about 7 friends. We’ve been friends since the start of high school, some of the friends joined in more recent years but after our graduation a few months back, I feel like I’m the only one who’s been distant. 

I considered these people my family at one point, but around the start of this year, I started to not feel like a core member of the group, and now I truly believe that I’m not. They hang out quite a bit, but it’s truly rare that I go and hang. Why? Because I’m almost never asked to. There’s a group chat and they’re  almost always on call. I don’t get on because I feel like I can’t relate with anyone in the group anymore, I seem to have very different interests than everyone now. I hate to be this guy, and I hate myself for being this guy, but they’re all immature and have nearly no capacity of being serious. They constantly make extremely racist jokes, I love jokes, but when they’re constantly joking using the word “Nigger” or “Kike” , it gets pretty annoying and downright distasteful. 

I used to love hanging out with these people but I’m a bit hurt that no one really reaches out to me for anything. At the same time I’m continuously questioning if I simply don’t want to be friends with these people. I’m not really lonely or depressed, I have a few other friends and I hang out with my girlfriend a lot. But part of me really just wants to burn the bridge and make some new friends in College(I start in about a week).

I’m moving 800 miles away. 

I won’t be around the same people. same house. same neighborhood. 

I will be on my own. This realization of going to college has hit me a few times, but this one hit me the hardest. 

I won’t have my own room. I won’t be able to go to my house after a hard day in school. My mom won’t be our family nice meals. 

I will be all by myself. It’s pretty crazy to think about. Every single day of my life has been the “same.” Same location. Same family. Same neighborhood. 

It’s all different now. New location. New friends. New family. New environment.

He plays various roles in my dreams. Sometimes I’m angry and screaming at him, other times he’s helping care for our child and we are in our future. 

Things didn’t work out so to stressful and conflicting schedules. I’ve taken the advice “it’s called a break up because it’s broken”. I do not deny our relationship was broken. He told me many times that he wants this relationship to work and he still wants to have kids together, he sees himself growing old with me, etc. 

We broke up with the premise of working on our selves and maybe trying again in June when I graduate from university. 

I have not had any real contact with him (I called him once while I was hospitalized and he texted to say he was sorry to hear I was I’ll). We haven’t physically seen each other since August. 

I want to see him. At least to have my “final talk” and we can clear the air about some things. At maximum I would love to start communication again and work towards a relationship. 

The issue is we never run into each other and he is very good at not responding. I emailed him about a meet up in November but he never responded. I really believe he has an avoidant attachment style due to his emotionally and verbally abusive mother who uses him like her servant. 

How do I illicit some sort of meeting from him? I truly believe we can have a life together and a new start could lead to amazing things.

I took the job mainly because I enjoy helping in my community and could see some opportunities to help the group improve with what they were doing (I already have a professional career).  A friend of mine is the president of this group, but my employment was not through her - I work for the collective members. Having said that, as president she sets the direction for the group and I see it as sensible to have her agreement on what I’m doing. 

The group was in quite a mess organizationally. They did not have a list of their members, did not have up-to-date contact information, their website hadn’t been updated in two years and contained inaccurate information, and many local businesses had zero interest in joining the group because they did not see value to their membership. 

I started at the job in earnest at the beginning of this week. First I used the information I had to create a list of who I thought might be members. I also created a second list of potential members. I then got to work calling each person on the list to update contact information - in about a quarter of the cases I was using google to find a phone number and going from there. Next I redesigned the registration form and list of benefits so that I could send these forms out to the current and potential members as 2018 fees are now due. As part of the same document (and on the request of the board) I also included a three page survey with some fairly general questions designed to help us understand the needs and wants of the membership. I uploaded this document to a closed Facebook group for the board and asked for feedback, and I texted my friend to call it to her attention.  This was Monday

On Tuesday my friend replied with some feedback. She made three points, one was helpful but the other two didn’t make sense to me so I called her. We both agreed on that conversation that the second point was a misunderstanding on her part and that left the third item. This was that I had listed as a benefit that local businesses would have a link on our website. She didn’t want me to include this as I hadn’t yet updated the site and “what if I couldn’t really do it”.   I thought it was an important point to include so I suggested that I take a few hours to spend on the website and make sure I could do what I was claiming. She agreed. A few hours later I contacted her to let her know I had learned how to do this and already created a new page with links to ten of the businesses. I asked if I now had her go ahead to say we could link to local businesses and she replied saying “you don’t need my go-ahead”. 

I continued to update contact information on Wednesday and to improve the website while I waited to give board members a chance to look over the membership benefit list, registration form, and survey I’d posted on the Facebook group. During this time I texted my friend and commented that I hadn’t received any input on the survey. She did not reply. She also did not reply when I sent her a message asking her to please look over the member list and provide any contact info she may know for those businesses that I could not find by using google. She also did not reply when I texted her to say that one of the local business owners had a promotional idea. 

Thursday I sent an email to all current and potential members with the registration package. 

Friday morning I received a text from my friend asking if I had sent out the survey. I replied that I had. Her reply was “what??? You weren’t supposed to send that out without showing me!!!!”  Now I found this quite confusing as the survey had been available for her to see for 4 days, she had given me feedback on the document but hadn’t expressed any reserves about the survey portion despite my specifically calling it to her attention, and the last thing I’d heard from her was that I didn’t need her go-ahead. I said I thought she’d seen the survey as she’d given me feedback on the first few pages of the document. 

She then replied that she had called me and told me not to proceed without her go ahead. At this point I was getting frustrated with both her refusal to be accountable for what was clearly her own error in either not actually noticing the survey in the first place or not communicating that she had any reserves whatsoever and also with the tone she was taking with me, which I did not find was appropriate for a professional colleague. I told her I had not proceeded without her approval and that I didn’t like the attitude she was taking with me. 

I didn’t hear from her for the rest of the day but when I did it was a text saying that I am not to proceed any further with my work and that I also should not meet with the local business person as scheduled on Monday to work on her promotional idea, and that I am to communicate with another member of the board from now on. She later stated that I would be instructed on my “parameters” by the other board member. 

I told her that I thought this was a terrible way to treat a friend and she replied that she was trying to save our friendship by not talking to me about this further. 

But. Right now I really don’t know that I want to continue with either the job OR the friendship.  I am so angry at what I perceive to be my friend’s inability to admit her own error and her insistence on blaming me, her hostile tone, and her action in choosing to speak to other board members rather than calling me to hash things out. On the other hand, until now she has always been a good friend and has been someone that has been kind and generous in the past. I’ve trusted her through some difficult recent times in my life and I hate to lose that.

I (17f) work at a teen clothing store in a mall. Most of my other coworkers are my age. (this is relevant later on). I also have a girlfriend (17). This is long, so buckle up.

Last night, I went out with some friends. My best friend, (16f, we'll call her T), her boyfriend (17m, we'll call him A), and a guy I hardly knew (18m, we'll call him D). We drove around and ended up in an alley way far from home. They got alcohol, and pressured me to drink. It was dark, so I could pretend to sip. I was not intoxicated, but they all thought I was.

Later on, my friend and her boyfriend pressured me to sit on D's lap. I complied, as I was far from home and at this point, two other much older (24) men were there). I explained later to D that I felt pressured to do that, and that I had a boyfriend. Boys always get creepy when they find out you're a lesbian. I lied about my s/o's gender, but made it VERY clear I was not available.

A pulled me aside and asked if I was into D. I said no, I have a boyfriend. A and T both said ""nobody would find out"". Bear in mind, they all think I'm intoxicated.

We drive back to our area, and we walked out on a field. They made me put alcohol in my bag, so I couldn't get my bag from the car. It was very dark, and by the time we made it halfway into the field, A and T were gone without a trace. D &amp; I were alone, in the dark. He proceeded to kiss my neck, and I pushed him away. He kissed harder &amp; I pushed away and said no, but he held me there. He kissed my lips, and I finally got up and away, and went looking for A &amp; T. 

When I got home, I immediately told my girlfriend what had happened. She is not mad, and reassured me that it was not my fault.

 The next morning (today), I had work. I felt so gross, I couldn't go without crying for 5 minutes at a time. I called in an hour before my shift, with no answer. Texted my manager, apologized for the short notice, and said it was an emergency. I'm asking for multiple pieces of advice here, I apologize if that isn't allowed.

tl/dr; I got assaulted by a boy who thought I was interested in him. I'm not sure if I cheated or not. I called out of work the next day with short notice because I felt physically ill &amp; traumatized.

1) Should I briefly tell my manager why I actually called out? I still have gotten no response, and my shift is now over. I'm afraid I'll lose my job.
2)  Did I cheat? I know I may have led him on, but it wasn't intentional, and I made it clear I was not interested, but I'm still unsure.
3) Should I report this incident? My only fear is that it won't be taken seriously, as it's not r-pe.

Hi, all. Brief summary: I'm 21 years old male and I study in a public college. To enter a public college, you have to work really hard. The competition is INSANE and those that want the hardest of courses have to study in an asian level. Anyway, I got into one and was quite happy.

I always heard public colleges were a little bad in the structure side of things, but mine is just terrible. In my course, we frequently don't have classes, teachers don't go to work because of ''personal problems'' all the time and this goes on. I didn't care (much) at first, until I got an internship ready for me because of my grades. Then a girl at my class just decided to have sex with the teacher so that she could have the internship and she got it.

This was the turning point in my faith in public colleges. It was said since high schools that public colleges were like this, that it ''prepares'' you ''better'' for the work market and I just decided to swallow it. But when things like that happens, the perspective changes.

First of all, I NEVER liked my course (Railroad engineering). i never liked the subjects. Never. But ''for money'', I could endure thos terrible classes (when I had then). 

The thing is, the classes were so few and far between that I decided to start Production Engineering in a private college. And maybe I should regret this decision, since I don't feel like going to my public college at all. Besides having classes EVERY DAY (this may sound mundane to you, but to me?), I already got an internship to me and I'm doing tons and tons of outside courses to improve my curriculum, all of those provided by the so called ''bad'' private college.

With that said, the easy course of action was to drop out of the public college for good, but I can't do that. I still don't pay my bills, so I'm not the owner of my life. Mother (who I love very much) don't want me to leave. But I talked to her and we decided to just press the ''pause buttom''.

But here comes the real problem that motivated me to ask this sub for advice. She told me that I should complete this semester first. And I can't. I intentionally missed some classes that I just couldn't care about (my will to study is the complete opposite in the private college). For those, I'm done. But there 2 or 3 that I can complete, but I also don't feel like doing this. I thought I was just lazy (or maybe I am?), but why do I feel like studying for the other college and not this one? 

You know the feeling of ''I just want to GET OUT of here''? That's what I'm feeling right now. But I also don't feel like just dropping it like this. But at the same time I just want to get away from all that crap. Do you see what I mean here?

Many things block my way of going there to finish those subjects, like someone mugging me with a gun INSIDE the building (funny story, we have supreme gun control in this country), getting there and the teachers just decide to not work because of ''personal problems'' (in fact, I was supposed to be there right now, but the teacher had to ''do'' something and was ''busy'' today)...

I'm sorry, do you see what I mean?

TL;DR: Have the option to leave a shitty college to focus on the good one. But at the same time, I don't wan't to simply leave. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I feel like just throwing everything through the window because I just can't stand that place.

But I have a really toxic friend and I don’t know what to do about it. Among many things, he acts as if he cannot possibly be worse than me at anything, always putting me down. The easiest example to use is that we were talking about how our Christmas break went, and I mentioned that my cousin, who I’m fairly close to, is getting married. He instantly snapped back with a tone that said “well, that’s nothing,” and boasted about how many of his siblings were also engaged. The worst it has been was after we got back our ACT scores, which is kind of a big deal, and I got a 33 (out of 36) and he shrugged it off by saying I was just good at test taking. This genuinely pissed me off. He constantly does things like this, he gets especially bad when we play video games, and I win multiple times in a row. You can almost see the salt on his face in those moments.  The reason we really became friends is just because of mutual interests, no sort of sentiment what so ever.

The reason this is hard for me is that I go to a boarding school, and I see him every day we are there. I will admit, he is fine most of the time, but the toxicity is hard to deal with and the constant contact I have with him is not helping the situation. 

Now the second query, I find it really hard to make friends. I think I’ve figured out why, but I have no way to fix it in sight. I see people as potential friends, but I never do anything to help the relationship because I don’t want to be annoying or weird to the point of ruining it before it started. I just don’t know how to deal with this double edged blade. 

And to tie the two together, I think the reason I’m good friends with the first guy is because he isn’t a valuable friend, so I don’t see a risk of losing him because there isn’t much to lose.

For the last two years my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant, with no luck. We were diagnosed with ""unexplained infertility"" which is maddening in and of itself. It's been hard talking to anyone about it because people who haven't dealt with infertility don't know what to say (I get that). But my sister, after months of not really responding to my spontaneous crying and feelings of frustration, wanted to help last month. So she gave us a ""fertility ceremony,"" where she lit candles and asked us to hold hands and imagine our child and then eat an old orange she brought back from a vacation to Barcelona which signified our fertility (we were only able to get through about half). We weren't asked to speak at all. I felt like she was trying to help us but it really didn't connect for me or my husband-- I would have much preferred her just sitting and asking me questions and being supportive in other ways. But I didn't say anything, just thanked her. 

Then I recently found out I was just with the wrong fertility doctor for the last 8 months, who didn't order the right tests. Turns out I have cysts on both ovaries (endometriomas) and most likely have stage 4 endometriosis. This dramatically changes what we have to do in order to get pregnant. 

I immediately call my sister and tell her to get checked out. Our mother had to have a full hysterectomy at 32 because of this disease, and I don't want my sister suddenly getting a cement pelvis or something (really a thing.) She thanks me and we hang up, then a couple hours later she phones and says she spoke to her ""channel"" (read: psychic) who told her that endometriosis is an unexplained disease because it is actually caused by negative or heavy energy that some women carry with them through life. Apparently he told her that my cysts are caused by energy our mother gave to us (had a relatively difficult upbringing, but hardly traumatizing and I get along well with my mom now) and that if I don't ""do the work"" to let go of this energy I may eventually miscarry even if I do end up achieving a pregnancy. 

This felt like the last straw. Let me also mention that she bought me a meeting with this ""psychic"" over the phone 18 months ago, who told me that I was going to get pregnant ""very soon."" Yeah, horseshit. I told her that first of all, either this guy was 100 percent full of crap, or at least as fallible as regular people who are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. Her attitude is that I am allowed to feel how I feel, but she simply doesn't agree, and is working on meditating and focusing on herself as ""whole"" to rid herself of the illness our mother basically gave her. 

 I feel torn. Honestly it feels like I'm not even allowed to hold any remotely esoteric beliefs or values because I am constantly on the wrong end of all this juju. Is it wrong to just want my sister's full support, even if I'm electing for surgery and potentially IVF, instead of thinking about my mother's mistakes? How do I tell her that we are all doing the ""work"" every day to deal with our pasts, and people who meditate every day don't necessarily always escape heartache or bad energy?

So to sum it up I have been paying my parents 450 in rent, paid my phone bill which is like 40 because we on a family plan, as well as paid for all my clothes and luxury items since i graduated high school. I don't feel as if I've made any ""major"" mistakes in my life. I did fail geometry in 10th grade because I got lazy, but I paid for the class in my senior year to retake it so that I would graduate with everyone else, which I think makes up for it in my opinion. I graduated when I was 17 and 1/2 years old and immediately started college. This is when my parents said they would start charging me rent and all the other things I listed above. For some reason they also think me paying it isnt enough so they also want me to work a full time job to save money on top of going full time to college. The first semester was hard but I pushed through and gave it my all and then this last semester which just passed drained me and I barely passed and am considering dropping out. I have told my parents how I feel but they said they don't care because it should be easy. This doesn't make sense to me because they didn't get their degree till they were in their mid 30's, and by my age they had kids of their own. Every time I bring it up they just brush it off, I honestly don't want to quit college, but at the same time I would like some support from them. It may be childish of me but after the past two semesters I don't think if I move out ill be able to handle working and college all alone in the world. I just want my parents to recognize and appreciate that I'm doing good compared to what they were at my age. I know there are a lot of people who are working a lot harder than me and not breaking down but this is how I honestly feel. I also hope this post doesn't comes off as whiny because that isn't the message I'm trying to give off.

At first working with animals seemed promising to me but after speaking with a ton of veterinarians, I’m really not looking forward to being in debt for a number of years while being underpaid. I’ve had veterinarians in their 50s who are just getting paid $100k or more as opposed to when they were in their 30s. 


I took a career aptitude test and results came out being art/music as my first and second being working with animals. Obviously the animals is shot down, I thought of doing veterinary medicine to be a vet tech... but it’s crazy how low the salary is. I’d rather be in customer service and get paid more than what vet techs are making. It’s crazy how much work they do to get paid that little, overall, veterinary medicine is just an underrated and underpaid profession. Which shouldn’t be. 


Anyway, my boyfriend is putting pressure on me to go to school and find something I like... but I just can’t. With art there’s really not much I can do unfortunately but maybe be a teacher or do music business. But I want to create, with that though, I won’t have a stable income. Even being an educator, they’re underpaid. But anyway, I tried getting into programming and it’s hard and I’m not sure if I even like it. The pay is what draws me but I just really don’t understand it, maybe because I’m doing it myself and I can’t focus very well but it’s so much money to do boot camps. I mean if someone can train me and teach me physically then maybe I can do it.

I did my first year of my undergrad at an out-of-state public university because they offered a huge scholarship that covered my room+board and a huge chunk of my tuition. I took out the basic federal loans and my family paid for the rest.

I was really unhappy there so I transferred to an out-of-state private university on financial aid and a merit scholarship. This transfer is where I fucked up.

I didn't do so hot academically and I lost my financial aid and merit scholarship. I now owe the school $66k sand I don't know what to do.

I'm currently at home taking the semester off trying to figure everything out. What are my options? Am I allowed to take classes at the local community college until everything is figured out before transferring to the local university at home?

My problem  is that I can't find a single thing in my life that I am really good at!

I'm maybe descent at some things but not good. And every time I try to get better at something I get frustrated because I can't see myself to get better (not after days but weeks/months).  


Back in my teens I was talented in some things but never pursued any of those talents and now I'm stuck being mediocre at them seemingly unable to become better and it really really brings me down.

&amp;#x200B;

All these ""I don't excel at anything"" thoughts were minor and didn't bring me down for more than a few minutes and they occurred rarely.  


But over the last one and a half year this isn't something that is coming to my mind every now and than but on a regular basis. Probably once or twice a week at least.  
Right now all that it needs for me to think about how bad I am at basically everything is to F\*ck up even the tiniest of things like drop something, not because i was trying to catch or playing around but just because I somehow dropped it! Just writing about it makes me mad!  


Just an hour ago I wanted to restart learning Programming. I want to make a small game but the moment I have everything set up I said to myself: Why even try? I won't succeed. I will try and fail, as always.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't told anybody about this because I don't want to bother them with something that seems so trivial and the best advice that they probably give me is ""just concentrate and try for longer""  


I'm even considering not posting this because I don't think my feeling about this is important enough to bother someone other than me. I can't find any motivation anymore for anything because I just know I won't succeed.   
I'm just living my miserable life and won't accomplish anything.

Mountain bike, surf, skate, whatever is really fun but those are my top. I have my own business and am very active in that. Though I work alone and at home so I don’t meet a ton of people. 

Seems all my current friends want to do is party. I’ve always been a partyer but recently I’ve been trying to get out of it. My pet died recently and I’ve been in a slump so I’m not doing anything active and am just watching anime all day. Watching anime enforces my opinion more too. I know it’s not real, but no one in anime goes out drinking to hangout. They hangout casually and just have a fun time. 

I do hangout w friends casually sometimes, but it’s never genuine and they always want to get high or drunk and go out. I hate to be that guy but it seems like it’s normal in our society. I feel I’m not building real relationships and it’s more of just a “we’ve been friends for so long, why wouldn’t we hangout” or it’s forced because we do the same hobby kind of. 

Seems like our friendship would just die or wouldn’t exist if we didn’t hangout or have X hobby. It feels like every relationship is fake and can just flip flop.

Anime relationships (I know, they’re fake. I usually don’t watch anime unless I’m depressed or down) just seem more genuine. 

I’m not sure how to express how I feel, but I feel like not meeting new people (because I work from home) genuinely is having a toll on me. I also don’t have 2 or 3 friends. I have about 5 close friends and 15 friends that I could hit up to hangout with. Most of the people I meet now though is mostly girls from bars and it feels so shitty.

So for a bit of context, I’ve known my Friend, K since I was very young, around 10+, I soon after met X, and T. As soon as I went to Secondary school, we were all separated into  different classes,me and X being in NA ,K bring in express,after being in the same class for 3 years. Just for a little context, the way it works where I’m from is basically we have 3 “streams” Express, Normal academic, Normal technical, “best” being first and worst being last. It’s kind of a touchy subject where I’m from so to keep it simple,  when you’re 12 you do a major national exam to decide which stream you go to in secondary school, once you’re in secondary school,if you score poorly in express you go to NA, if you score badly in NA you go NT.  Me and X through out our secondary one were in NA, while my K was in Express, we all looked up to him as he was the only one in our group of friends who we saw wasn’t as dumb as us. 

Over the course of Sec 1, he failed miserably and went to NA Sec 2, bummer, but it’s ok. So he got put in the same class as X, while I was still in another class. Cut to the present, finally we are all in the same class. He has changed a lot since I last saw him, apparently now smokes, is now best friends with X’s EX, which makes it awkward for all of us. He got so drunk at a party I hosted that he took about a hundred photos of the ceiling fan and was genuinely dying of laughter. Keep in mind we were all underage. He frequently just runs out of his house to go and meet with X’s ex, who we’ll call E, and has driven his divorced mother to call him an embarrassment, and also said that she hates him, promptly kicking him out of the house, to which he doesn’t seem to care all that much, usually returning home after a few days. Immediately afterwards, he just proceeded to go get a drink, and a pack of smokes, and of course meet with E. He milks his Father for money when all he does his yearn for his affection and love. It kills me to see what he’s doing, X insists that I just let it go and let him do whatever he wants, it’s his life after all, but I feel like something has to be done. I’ve known him for a good part of my life and can’t see him suffer with shitty results, living in a shitty house just waiting for his parents to die eventually to get their cash. He wastes his life moping around Void Decks and loitering around smoking in public. He has several police cases and a 6month probation has been turned into a 13 month because of his shitty attitude, and mostly just smoking and barely hiding it. 

What should I do? I’ve tried telling him nicely before but that’s before he got kicked out, and never has he ever shown this little care or concern for his life. He’s my Friend and I want what’s best for him.

Going from high school to college was the worst! I cried every night for an entire week when I moved into my dorms. I cried leaving my dorm to go back home. I cried when I left my part time jobs. My biggest problem has always been accepting change. What upsets me the most is knowing that things will never be the same, exactly as they are, after a certain point. Like I will continue to see/hang out with my roommates after moving out, but it will never be the same as it was when we shared our apartment. And like leaving my jobs, I know I will still be able to see my coworkers, but not in the same context and because it isn't in the same context, our relationship won't be the same if that makes sense? I know that things have to change and people change and that's just a part of life's ebb and flow, but I don't know how to cope with it. I get dropped into this deep depression every time I have to move on from something, someone and it feels like I won't stop crying for days. I think maybe the reason is that I get too attached to people and places... What am I supposed to do? Learn to be more detached?? I'm going to be living abroad alone for a couple of months soon and I can already feel myself falling into this well.

I will try to give 100&amp;#37; accurate information as I saw the whole debacle unfold, but I will no use names and change some details to obscure the identities/company involved.   

I work for a company of about 500 employees.  We are a startup, growing steadily over the last 5 or so years.  We offer a line of products and services (let's call them widgets).  Most of our money was gained through private investors and pre-sales online.   While we plan to offer dozens of products (unique widgets), each one is very different so, it needs to be planned (artwork), built, programmed to function, bug tested, and then we pre-release them to consumers (to keep them happy basically).  These widgets all connect to and interact with a master widget.  Each widget is unique, (really cool gadget in fact!) and a consumer can choose their own style.  They vary in price from around 100-2000 dollars depending on how fancy you want to get.  Some people choose to buy many widgets and can be invested in the range of a few thousand dollars (or more!).

Consumers seem to love them, even though they don't do very much right now, and they sell like hotcakes (millions pour in still).  The original release date of the master widget was \*years\* ago.  The CEO claimed we were within a few months of release, and then pushed it back a few months.  Ok, no problem... well...  this has happened 6-7 times in the last 5 years.  I have seen the master widget briefly and interacted with the programmers/testers and it is broken, with no fix in sight.  In fact, no one seems to know how to fix it with current technology.  Thus, all the little widgets may never fully function.  When someone asked the CEO why they kept telling everyone the master widget would be done and then it never came about, the CEO just said ""I was just being optimistic!""  or ""I must be bad with dates!""   Sales of tiny widgets continue online and the company is doing well, all based on the promise of the master widget coming in to save the day and activate all the tiny widgets.  Right now, they are pretty paperweights (essentially).  

The other issue is that the CEO dispatches news releases constantly and continues to add features lists to the master widget.  At this time I think it can cure cancer!  (haha, but not far from the truth)  So, tiny widget sales stay steady based on the promise of the release of this magical master widget (we see a nice hop in sales after each news release).   Also, the CEO must personally approve every tiny widget design.  Very micro managing.  If it does not meet CEO's standards, it will be scrapped and redesigned from the ground up.  We have hundreds of tiny widgets (probably thousands in the wild), and no master widget to bring it all home.  Yet, like clockwork, the CEO releases an update and says the master widget will be out by the first quarter.  No, the second quarter... no, by end of year, oh and now it will do dishes!!!  Rinse repeat for 5 years.  We might be 5-10&amp;#37; complete, per the programmers, maybe less.

Shouldn't a manager know what his team is up to and when a realistic release date would look like?  Why would the CEO do this?  Is this optimism or incompetence?    Knowing the master widget is barely functioning and years of development and R&amp;D will be required for it to even do 50&amp;#37; of what CEO promised, what am I to think?  Is the CEO lying to continue to sell tiny widgets and can I, knowing this, be implicated in all of this (if it is a crime)?  Money isn't an issue for the company at large, the idea is really amazing, but the reality is that the master widget is just... well... not a reality.  I have full confidence everyone thought it COULD be done 5 years ago when it all started. Optimism was high!  Now, I don't know if anyone still thinks that, at least, not in the next 5 years.  We are all kind of nervous now.

Okay, I know this might sound like I just an older sibling complaining, but I genuinely feel frustrated and he crossed the line. I just need to know whether or not I am being paranoid and being an asshole. Advice on how to handle this situation is also extremely welcome.

My brother (10m) has always been... defiant. He won't understand what the word ""no"" means and refuses to respect my sister (13f) and me (16m). Yeah, most little kids are just assholes and do whatever the hell they want, but yesterday when he actively tried to make me uncomfortable by sneaking up on me while I was naked and changing. Take into account that the three of us share a room and I always tell people to get out so I can do so without anyone watching. I mean, I don't think he tries to look at me because of anything sexual, but because it bothers me. I like my privacy and believe that everyone deserves respect. He'll also copy how my dad behaves towards my mom and stroke our laps in an inappropriate way. I tried to tell him that it's not proper to do that and our parents only act that way because they're a couple (he doesn't know anything about sex yet because my parents are iffy about educating my siblings on it). He still continues just to annoy us.

If I yell at him, which I have done many times, I get in trouble, since I am the eldest and should be more ""mature."" If I complain, my mom just makes excuses saying it's hard for him to understand social norms. I think they're enabling him. I mean, they still call him ""baby"" and babytalk to him for Christ's sake. It's not even like he has a mental condition or anything.

Well, today I told my mom my feelings. I suggested that they either talk to him and directly tell him to behave better or take him to a specialist that can help. She got so upset saying I was reading too much into his behavior and saying that I am accusing him of being a pervert. No, I don't think he's a pervert, but he is acting like one because they let him. I snapped and got into huge trouble for being disrespectful and telling them how to raise him.

I have seen a therapist, regular doctor, and neurologist about these symptoms, and they said I was fine. Everyone I talk to doesn't understand how my bad my symptoms are, and will just say it's a psychological issue. My parents don't know how to help me. I don't know who else to talk to, or how I can diagnosed this issue, or even deal with it. I really don't know what causing these symptoms. I am constantly active, I eat healthy, I live in a healthy environment, I haven't recently took any drugs, I get enough sleep, and shit, I even take supplements. 

I have sincerely been considering suicide because of this. If these symptoms are irreversible, and I can never recovery, what's the point of living? I even feel like killing myself now considering how fucking cruel, and prejudice life is. If these symptoms are permanent, how could I find enjoy in my life? How could I be happy knowing I used to be a successful and highly intelligent teenager, to now being borderline ""retarded""?

We ended up going to different high schools, but I still consider him one of my best friends despite not seeing him as much as I’d like.

E was there for me through all of the issues I had with my family. He was there for me when I was at my lowest. Whenever I felt like shit for breaking down in front of him, he always made it a point to make me feel comfortable. He was there for me at a point where I needed it most and without him I probably wouldn’t be here today.

This was all during a period where I had to look out for myself the most. I had to constantly keep myself in check in order to stay afloat. Because of this, I didn’t put nearly as much effort into the friendship as E did, yet somehow, he was still so loving and supportive.

Now that I’m able to look back and see how much E helped me, I’d really like to know how to thank him. I’m not really good with words and I find it hard to really convey emotional stuff without feeling kind of silly and awkward about it (I’m trying to get better at that but I haven’t improved much).

I didn’t feel the same way he did because I realize I cannot have their attention 24/7 and if they have something to do, they should do it. He was slightly upset by that answer. I assume it’s because he thinks I don’t care as much as he does. 

I also told him I can’t multitask well. So whenever we talk, I literally sit at my desk and do nothing. Don’t watch YouTube, don’t play games, don’t talk to friends...hell. Even going on my phone. I do that because I was yelled at (he was screaming at me)  by my ex (many times) since he didn’t like that I didn’t pay attention to him when he was talking.

I can't do both because university is eating up my money, meaning no money left to trade with.

**Topics of Consideration:**

**School:** I dislike school and have a shitty GPA (2.8, can't retake classes due to financial strain) so I don't really feel motivated pursuing that. My major (pretty locked in at this point) generally requires grad school and I have poor chances of getting in to one.

**Trading:** I have been very successful trading over the past 6 weeks (after about 6 months of on and off study) with about 18 profitable and 2 unprofitable trades ON PAPER, making about 7% return. This is spending only about 45-60 minutes a day on this. I really enjoy this and have been spending a fraction of the time on it that I would were I to have enough money to trade for real.

**Other:** School is a huge financial burden (I am living off family member's money). Due to some mental health circumstances requiring me to take a leave from school early on, my GPA is shit and I won't get into the grad schools that I want. I may also be able to receive the money which otherwise would have gone to paying for my education to pursue trading, which would give me great starting capital.

I have a few dreams, and right now the most relevant is financial independence. I'm tired of being a financial burden on my family, and after overcoming some mental health issues including a stay in a psych hospital, I have finally been in a position to pursue the thing that I wanted to go to school for: finance and trading. And to see myself be successful at it on paper, it's invigorating like almost nothing else.

**My plan:** So yeah. I could drop out and bartend, work night jobs while trading during the day and make probably $40-50k this year, of which I might invest about $20,000 into trading. **Based on my major and GPA, this is probably about as much as I'd make after graduation anyway.** At my current rate of return it would take just over a year to double an investment, so if I can continue perfecting my trading strategies and investing money from work, it might take about 2.5 years to pocket $100k of profits.

I've already paid for this next quarter of school, so I will continue to test my trading ability, and if it flops or becomes less consistent, well I'll have my answer.

Hey guys and girls,

Im a dude. This potential stalking situation is with one of my ex-friends. **So he is a really toxic, delusional, narcissistic, and frankly crazy person (Long Story).** I cut things off for a long time, 2 years, until I started getting unknown caller id numbers.. I would pick up and it would hang up. It kept happening from time to time.

So I thought it was my ex friend trying to contact me because I blocked his number. So I call his number just to see if he would pick up and so I could ask if he was the one calling me. He doesnt pick up the phone and later contacts me.

He texted me on a social media platform, Trying to check in with me, saying its been a while. I wasn't having it and just asked him about the caller id situation, and he said that he wasnt doing it, So I said okay, bye.

**BUT**, I also lastly mentioned, because I had a **gut feeling** he might try to visit my house, specifically to not visit my house. I straight up said **""you're not gonna visit my house or something right? none of that weird shit?""**, and he said ""no ""(as in agreeing not to do it)

**BUT** WHAT DO YOU KNOW, I take a dab relaxing after work. and I hear knocking on my front door. i thought it was a deliveryman, but there was no UPS truck nor did I hear a sound of it. SO i check my window, and I see someone with their back facing me walking away from my house that sorta looked like my friend, but i couldnt quite tell. its been awhile.

**I kinda start to panic a bit**, but I feel as if theres no way he would actually come. So I go outside and look around cautiously and dont see anything out of the ordinary. So I go back inside the house just a bit freaked out but doubting it was actually him.

**BUT** he does...and he knocks again...and walks up to my door with a smirk. and **i RECOGNIZED HIM INSTANTLY.** I had to call him and talk him through to How he was being creepy and all that. And he kept trying to fuck with me, saying that he was still there at my house. I kept telling him to leave me alone but he wouldnt respond to that clearly. **He just enjoys mentally fucking with people and using play on words during arguments/when someone is trying to make a point. He told me that he has a lot of problems, and I said ok.**

**Now** I Have a **GUT FEELING** that he might try to come back to my house or wait for me to get out of my car after work.

I dont want to see him face-face and Idk what to do because thats what he seems to want, and he is kinda crazy...

I need people with experience and dedication to help me get out of this potential stalking situation and keep this person physically away from me..

Please, and thank you.

One worry that I have is that in my batch, there's another guy who has been placed on a pedestal to be the next president. He's placed there because he has voiced his opinions that he wanted to be president among my peers and he has been selfless and looks out for the welfare of my peers. I badly want this position because I'm passionate about dance and i have not had any opportunities to be in a position where i could lead. I have been trying to spend more time with my club members but i find that it is a challenge sometimes.

A few months after she passed, I got/was pressured into getting a new cat. I like this new cat, but she's very active and dislikes being held and cuddled. I'm gone a lot of the day for work and live alone, so partly I'm worried for myself since I don't have any sort of comfort from new kitty, and partly I'm worried that she would prefer an active household with kids or other pets - things to keep her stimulated.

What do you all think about rehoming my new cat? I've had her for three months now and we just haven't clicked. I don't want to put too much expectation on a cat, of course, but I think I probably wasn't ready for another.

1. 8+ hours in Miami   
2. 12+ hours in Charlotte  
I am not looking for advice on how to stay alive in the airport overnight. Despite what my parents think, I am perfectly capable of making it out alive. After all, I have done [my survival research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz-QYN_Kl6g).   
What I want to do is use this time creatively for a project of some sort. What exactly that is, how it will be worked on, and how it will be documented, are totally up to you Reddit. From this post, WHATEVER the top upvoted solution is I will do to the best of my ability. (one project if it takes both nights or two projects if they take one each) NO BAMBOOZLE!

It could use my speaker to ""host"" an impromptu [80s exercise session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIfAkOBMf5A) at the airport. I could take a [survey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWS8Mg-JWSg) of the favorite potato chip flavor of people staying overnight at the airport. I could use my Heelys to create a music video or just [cruise around at Mach 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVbtVQ2BXvs). I could go up to random strangers and pretend to be a [time-traveling reporter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YQJJPkafl0). I could print [outlet stickers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8b7acamOdg) and record reactions. You could literally just [tell me to sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWuEhcR_ozU). IT'S YOUR CHOICE!

I will post the results within a month of this post. If I don't, feel free to take me to Karma Court. 

&amp;#x200B;

First a few ground rules:

1. It must be fully able to be completed within the airport
2. Nothing Illegal (I ain't going to jail for internet points)
3. Nothing that puts anyone (including myself) in physical harm
4. Nothing that would take an unwieldy amount of time to edit or produce outside the airport. (Eg. a music video is fine, but a feature film is not) 

  
The items I have at my disposal:  
My cellphone camera, Mini Tripod, Tascam DR-40 (handheld microphone), A loud portable Bluetooth speaker, A smashing personality, No fear when talking to strangers, A fresh set of Heelys (how else will I get around?), and a bunch of Cliff Bars for food.   
Additional supplies could be purchased before or at the airport with a budget of $25ish dollars. Keep in mind that for the additional supplies I do have limited space in my luggage.

I don't really know how to go upon doing this. I'm a 23 y/o male. I don't have a lot of money so I didn't want to do something wrong and still have to pay for it.
I have a history of adhd, when I was a kid in elementary I was on Adderall and Strattera. My mom said she didn't like the Adderall for me and she stopped giving it to me.
I've tried it throughout high-school and Adderall never did anything to me. Like literally 0 change, tired if anything and I spend most of my life on the verge of a nap.
Recently here I've tried Adderall again a few times and it's helped me focus amazingly and also gave me a decent boost of energy that helped me focus and get things done and I spent the couple days I've tried it in such a good mood bc simple tasks weren't overwhelming.

I guess what I need advice on is how to get myself back on it. Do I go to a doctor? Psychiatrist? Therapist? I don't have a primary or anything. I didn't even have insurance since I was 17 until this year. I'm clueless to this stuff and like I said I don't want to go to a doc and pay for a visit to be told I need to go somewhere else.

This is long-ish, but I need advice TL;DR at the end.

About two years ago, I went through a rough breakup. I didn’t handle it well, but overall I’ve lived a very sheltered life, so I didn’t get “wild”, but I tried going out and socially drinking on weekends like other people my age. Around this time I got a message from a photographer I had modeled for when I was preteen and he was early 20s. He was in town for a video project, wanted to grab dinner and catch up, and see if I could help with the project.

We both had wine at dinner and I was completely wasted on two glasses of wine (my guess is that something was added). I wanted to go home, so I called an Uber. He said he’d walk me and wait with me, but then he also got in the car. At this point I was uneasy, but too out of it to protest much, and he said he was just “getting me home safe” and then he’d get a ride to his hotel.

That’s not what happened. He “helped” me inside, but then he started getting undressed. At this point I’m baffled, and starting to black out. I’ll save the graphic details, but after what seemed like forever he got off of me and I passed out. 

I woke up on the floor in the morning, and he was still there in my bed, awake. He just watched me as I stumbled to the bathroom. I thought I would die with how bad my head was pounding, but I was unsure if it was a dream since I couldn’t feel the rest of the pain in my body. I sat in the bathroom a while with the shower running, eventually he knocked said he had to leave, I said bye. Eventually, I showered and noticed that my toe was broken, then I noticed bruising, handprints and tenderness internally and externally.

A week later he called to yell at me on voicemail that I gave him an STD (spoiler: I already tested clean). I told him over text I didn’t and that I didn’t appreciate his tone and didn’t want to talk to him again. And that was that... until recently, he messaged again.

I realized I had not dated anyone, or slept with anyone since then, and even though I buried the memory it was still affecting how I felt about sex/men. Now I’m dealing with the torrent of emotions, that I had not processed before. Mostly unexpectedly, this includes a fear of authoritative/fatherly men. I suppose it makes sense since we only had a professional working relationship while I was a child, and though he was young, he was still an adult with authority over me. What’s more is that I can’t get over the creep factor of him likely finding me attractive as a child, who posed in swimsuits in front of him (we hadn’t kept in contact between then and the incident). I’ve become a recluse, and haven’t talked to my dad or grandpa in over a year even though I was very close to them before. I humiliated, ashamed, scared, paranoid and sad.

What do I do next? How do I move on? Why won’t he leave me alone?

He’s still living with them, and the topic of conversation became taxes.

We live in a country where taxes are terible and ruin a lot of companies and enterpreneurs. He started pointing out his idealistic vision that people needed to pay taxes and never cut corners, eg, by downloading pirated software, trying to buy things off the books, etc.

We tried to explained to him how sometimes it’s necessary if you want to eat and pay your employees salaries, and that having a moral high ground is not always an option of your goverment is destorying you with taxes and thr economy is jot doing well.

Well, when I tried to intervene in the conversation, he started “shooshing me”, trying to prevent me from intervening. I was going to contribute with my ideas but he didn’t want that as he thouht I would be hostile.

I ignored his attempts at “putting me down” and still intervened. He kept at it, saying “nobody was talking to me”, and I lost it. I just god damn lost it...

I started talking over him and when he attempted to berate me, I started insutling him. See, my brother is shielded, always has been, and my parents protect him, so he thinks he’s naivete is justified and I’m just an arrogant asshole who wants to provoke poeple.

The discussion moved forward, he still attemtping to shoosh me and look like a victim, my parents trying to keep things quite, and me trying to prove my point that he had no idea what he was talking about.

In the end, he stood up, offended, and turn around to say a lot of things like “I’m not a good brother” and “he cannot have a simple discussion without getting insulted” and so on.

I told him to stop palying the victim role, and he replied “then why do you insult me? You are 32 years old...”. And I had it.

I shouted at him that if he doesn’t want to be insulted then he should not “put down”, “diminish”, “jerk me around” or “fucking shoosh me when talking”. I told him “I’m not his parents that protect him like a poor delicate flower so if he wants to act like a dick then he’ll be treated as such...”

He kept pressing, I kept shouting, well aware he wasn’t gonna win this. I was so mad, so angry at feeling “put down”. He even attempted to justify his actions and berate my reaction by saying stuff about my age, my maturity, my broderhood, etc, and all I kept shouting was “don’t put down... don’t put down... don’t put down... don’t put down...”

Eventually he backed down, got into his room, took the car keys and run off. My parents were furious that I did that, although they calmed down as soon as I calmed down.

I realize I went overboard with my reaction, especially since he’s not used to that kind of heat. I immediately texted him on whatsapp and sent him a voice message, apologyzing to him and reminding him it was just a discussion and it didn’t mean anything. He deleted my contact number...

I don’t know what to do. I feel like crap. I know he’s insecure, defenseless, sensitive, and has probably no idea how the world works... and I overreacted terribly.

Sorry for weird formatting!

Some backstory: I have a non-existent relationship with my father and I knew from a young age that my family and I were pretty far down on his list of priorities. In the fourth grade I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder which later on was topped off with a heaping load of depression. Following the suggestion of a therapist, my mum adopted two cats a couple of years ago to help with my mental health. I love those two a lot more than anything else in the world and I do my best to keep up with all cat-related chores, but on the days that I don't clean up in time he flips out and goes batshit insane on spewing insults and telling me that I'm worthless, should go kill myself and the likes. Just nasty stuff overall.

Recently, I've been having a pretty rough time as it's my last trimester before graduation and my mum must have noticed it as she sent me to China during the break to ""refresh my mindset"" which I strongly opposed because I didn't want to leave my cats alone with my father but my mum convinced me that it'll be fine and I trusted her. 

Upon leaving China, I was feeling better, not a lot better but better. When I got home, the first thing I did was check up on my cats. I did a once over of the house and couldn't find them so I asked my mum for help because I thought they might be hiding, but it turned out that my father gave them away. I started crying and he started yelling some pretty fucked up shit at me which continued every time I saw him for the next couple of days.

I've been actively avoiding him since and have been mostly locked up in my room as I'm not in a great place mentally or physically and I'm really scared of him yelling more or hitting me.

I'm not sure where to go from here. Any advice would be appreciated.

This is a sensitive subject and i'm not sure if i'm going to offend anybody. I definitely hope not. i'm definitely embarrassed even posting things but this community has helped me in the past. First, a quick intro. I am a 25 year old white male from the midwest- born here and lived in the same State my entire life (though we moved around a few times).

A few weeks ago, someone brought something to my attention that has been weighing on my mind a lot and I feel conflicted, confused, and even a bit angry. I basically just want some answers, and that's why I'm here. We were at a sports bar watching the game. My best friend invited me to join a group of people who knew each other well, so naturally people took an interest in me as the ""new guy"". Everyone was chill, and they seemed to take an interest in me, asking about my favorite music, hobbies, interests.... 

After talking about myself to the general group during the beginning of the night, the conversation split into multiple little conversations around the table and I was mainly talking mainly to the dude sitting next to me.   It was very noisy anyway and hard to keep up with everything going on around me.

When I told my new conversation partner how good the Black Panthers movie was,  he burst out laughing and told me that I seem ""completely fascinated by black culture"" and asked me why I don't ""have any interest in things white people do."" I was nervous at the time and didn't really internalize this comment. I was shocked but just brushed it off with an awkward laugh and we moved on. 

Over the next few days what he said really started bothering me. Dont get me wrong, I understand in a way where he is coming from. My favorite musicians are Drake, Nelly, Jayz, Kanye, etc. Its not because of race, I just like chill music. I used to be a diehard Kevin Hart fan and went to his shows a couple times. I'm into playing ball and play a couple times a week. I had a Kevin Garnett poster in my dorm room in my freshman year. I've always taken an interest in social justice causes and went to a few campus protests before, but standing up to police brutality isn't about race to me. Its about equality.  And yes, I was a huge Obama fan and even helped volunteer part-time for his re-election campaign in 2012. I grew up in a liberal family and his message of tolerance, respect, and unity moved a lot of people. I think he was one of the most inspirational political figures in years and that's why I got involved in his campaign. It was never about black or white for me. 

So on one hand, i'm resentful that he called me out for my preferences in movies, sports, comedy, music. Its not racial to me, and i like what i like. I think it wasn't his business and he was really out of line in saying that. 

But on the other hand, i have to be honest with you guys. I gave it a lot of thought after the guy said what he said and realize that struggle to find a single white entertainer, athlete, or public figure that I respect. And in a way, I have to accept that it is a little unusual. But maybe at the end of the day it doesn't even matter, right? Everyone drifts towards their own natural interests and it is what it is. 

I guess i just want to know...is there anything wrong with my preferences? Why have I turned out the way I did? How should I have handled the situation? Should I be angry or am I making too big a deal of this? Is this entire post just overanalysis of something completely meaningless?  

TLDR: I am obsessed with black culture and I don't know why.

A little furball of a chihuahua. She had a lot of hair for a chihuahua. A full coat. She died suddenly of a combination of a stroke and heart attack. It all happened within about 8-10 minutes until she drew her last little breath in my arms. I'm crying hysterically as I write this and I can't find peace. I cry every time I'm not doing something, like talking to people I don't want to cry near or playing an online game with people. Anything that has to do with me being alone or doing something by myself, or even just walking through my house, keeps reminding me of her in all the little ways I still remember her. I remember the good, the bad, and the moments of death. I tried so hard. She fell over when it happened and went practically limp. I held her. I tried to feed her. Her mouth was sealed shut but you could see her make the most miniscule efforts to try and eat. I wrapped a towel around her. I tried wetting her face. I held her near the heater to try and keep her warm. I even attempted CPR after she was dead, when I didn't accept it. I tried so many things, but she was robbed from me and my family here.

We took her to an animal control facility to get buried because we don't have anything but concrete property here, plus it's illegal to bury pets in my city. We cut off a small amount of hair from her tail, which we're going to keep laminated with a photo of her in a little frame with her name on it.

I can't be happy anymore. Anything I do is just to get by or pass time. I enjoy nothing. I can temporarily distract myself and lessen my thoughts on the matter, but I just can't forget. I never will, and I know time will heal me, but I just know that this will leave a permanent hole on my heart forever. It's gonna hurt me for many years to come, just like when we had to give my first dog away due to expensive sickness we couldn't afford while I was younger.

I have another dog. He's been sticking by me in this. I think he feels the sadness and pain. I just don't know what to do, though. I'm so thankful I still have the little one, but I can't help but feel so much of quite every bad feeling when I think of my dog. Seeing her in my head makes me a little happy but more sad that she isn't here with me anymore. I loved her so much, and I just can't move on from this. I have to move on from this, but I will never fully do so. What can I do to try and numb the pain? I currently look at life like a good friend that has done me wrong. I'll never like that friend even though they donated $1000 to charity, because of all the other bad things they've done. I see life that way right now.

I sought support from anyone who was close to me, including my girlfriend. She was not very supportive, eventually got tired of my being anxious, and started being very mean to me. I realized how toxic of a person she was and decided that I had to break up with her if I was ever going to get out of the deep dark hole I'd fallen into. I tried to do it peacefully, but she did NOT take it well. The rest of senior year was shitty because I had to be around her so much, as she was in my classes and would hang around a lot of my good friends. I ended up not going to prom because of her. At graduation she gave me an apology, which I did accept.

Fast forward a year, I've gotten through most of my first year of college. I haven't quite been satisfied with it, as I didn't really make friends or be a part of the social scene there. I am home for spring break, and I went to go hang out with two of my closest friends. Well it turns out that one of them invited my ex over to the same hangout. He thought that we got along well, which isn't exactly the case. Despite her apology, she really isn't a person I would like much to do with. I didn't interact with her much and played nice throughout the hangout, but once I left those old memories started coming back. I've had nightmares about her for the past two nights. I also have had self-estesm issues, as I feel annoyed that she seems to be having a better college life than me. 

I would really like to let go of these feelings and just move on with my life, but I'm not sure how.

I am so afraid of seeming as someone pushy, so I always, always take the passive route. This time, I want to be more daring and brave, but what should I do now? Wait till he writes to me? Or should I write to him? But I don't want to seem desperate or pushy.

I'm scared that me asking to game with him and add him might have been pushy already haha!

What I learned to know is that he is supposedly quite busy with schoolwork, so I know I am not gonna write a lot to him.

Long story short, my grandfather is sick and my grandmother needs help with his care, its too much for the two of us to handle and medicare is dragging ass.

So the last thing I expected was for him to become a roommate, and needless to say He's been a complete insufferable dick since the day he walked in, wanting to change everything about the rules of the house (I smoke outside at a picnic area, he doesn't want it on the property at all, He sent pictures of my room to my aunt and told me to get a bin of my clothes off the floor or he'd throw them out, constantly putting me down every chance he gets etc etc the list goes on.)

It was obvious to me at every stage of the interview that she has behavioural issues, she complained about everything she was asked to do in the interviews, she was snappy sometimes, her entire focus was on how much time off she can get and how many days she can work from home.

Anyway, she got hired against my better judgment and sure enough, she is as unprofessional as I thought. Her first action when she starred was taking few days off the next week. It was not pre booked holiday either, she just said that she wants time off work. She wants to start her day at 10:30AM, she thinks it's unreasonable for me to ask her to start no later than 10:00AM.

She started asking for work from home days in her first month, she complained about everything, literally, even people having conversations in the office, it bothers her, yet she doesn't mind jumping into other people's conversations uninvited, she literally rolls her chair and squeezes herself between two people having a work discussion and when they give her a questioning look she says that they can pretend she is not here, she just wants to listen.

She sends me a message one day saying that she is not coming, doesn't even give a reason, and won't pick up my call.

She wastes time while pretending to work and when I ask about her progress she gives me a snappy answer or doesn't answer at all.

When I tried to give her feedback she went to my manager and complained about me micromanaging her.

All this and she's still on probation. 

The problem is that I cannot just terminate the probation without going through a lengthy process of proving behaviour issues and refusal to change.

The other issue is that she is clever, when she gets to it she does a decent job, we're having difficulty finding people with the right skills so it's harder to get rid of someone who does have the technical skills.

Anyone with experience who can advise on hoe to manage this situation?

Hi Everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I have a dilemma and I’m looking for some advice on how to handle it. I’ve been working at my current job for six years. I enjoy the work, the pay is pretty good, and I have benefits plus time off which is great. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I’m having is with one of my co-workers, who is a massively toxic and all-around garbage person. He’s been with the company for over 20 years and is great at his job. On top of that there have been numerous complaints about him and despite this, he’s never come close to being fired. 

&amp;#x200B;

The things he says go beyond being inappropriate and while I’ve tried to deal with it, I just can’t anymore. I’ve tried ignoring him, standing up for myself, “giving him a taste of his own medicine” – nothing works. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work at the location he’s in three days a week (location A) and another location he’s not in two days a week (location B). Three days may not seem so bad, but we’re all closely clustered together in an open office with no barriers or cubical dividers, so I can see and hear him the entire 10-12hr workday (he’s so close I can easily hand him a piece of paper without leaving my chair).

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely don’t have thick skin (not for a lack of trying) and I have terrible anxiety that I’m taking medication and seeing a doctor for. Being around him and dealing with his toxic attitude and comments honestly drain me. While he does it to everyone, I’d say 60% are directed towards me (regarding my weight, religion, age difference, etc.) and I just can’t take it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I frequently have to excuse myself to go in the bathroom to cry and by the time I get home I’m so miserable I don’t enjoy myself at all. I’ve even started becoming sick prior to leaving my house in the morning when I have to work at the location he’s in.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, location B is wonderful. Even though the commute is twice as long, the people are fantastic and I can get so much more done because I’m not feeling terrible the entire day. I do have specific duties when I’m at location A, but during my last review my boss spoke to me about giving me more responsibilities and removing some of the duties I have at that location. I’ve also spoken to the manager at location B (he originally trained me when I first started and we have a great relationship) and he said he’d be more than happy to have me there five days a week instead of two. So that’s not an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

What I’m worried might be an issue is that this has happened before with another co-worker two years ago. He was actually fired for the harassment (it was myself and two other girls), but when it was happening I put in a request to work at location B full time and it was denied. I don’t want to go to my boss with this and have her think that I’m a pansy who can’t handle myself. I can take a joke and I have a good sense of humor, but what he says just goes beyond what is appropriate.  

&amp;#x200B;

So.. is talking to my boss a good idea? If so, how do I phrase it? I don’t want her to think I’m weak because I can’t handle a shitty co-worker (after all, I’m not at work to make friends or be happy). I was thinking of talking to her about the issues I’m experiencing and then mentioning my desire to have more responsibilities like we spoke about and how moving into location B might be a better opportunity for me? Do I mention my medical issues with the anxiety when/if I speak to her?

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for a new job would probably be the easiest thing for most people but unfortunately my finances are very tight right now and I would be unable to find a job with similar pay and benefits (I only know because I’ve been actively looking and even went on several interviews). :(

After work, we stopped at a gas station en route to the hotel.  I bought a beer and drank it on the way to the hotel.

That was a month ago.  Today I was called into HR and confronted with ""...we were told that you bought a six pack on the company card and drank it in the car with vendors present..."" violating state law, company policy, etc.  While this was all true with the exception of the quantity of beer and means of purchasing (I paid cash), I obviously knew that this information was relayed to the company via my part-time colleague, who has disagreed with me on many things with the project we are currently assigned to.

At the time of the trip, I thought to myself ""gosh I wish I recorded these guys and all their racist ramblings"" as they talked about everything MAGA and how they hate black people (in more explicit terms).  But I decided to say quiet and let it pass as I am not a snitch and don't care to tear someone down that way.  Little did I expect the tables to turn and have MY career on the line. 

I was let off with a written warning and have to take some alcohol courses to meet my end of the deal to stay at the company.  I will now have to continue working with the same person who tried to get me fired.  How should I handle this situation?  Do I retaliate ? Do I say anything to the guy?

Some weeks ago I was trying some shirts on, one of the staff was so gentle to pick me a white one to try on, the shirt was actually nice and I made her a compliment saying that she had a nice taste, she smiled back and added something. 

A week or so later I was in there looking for a rain/winter coat, she was sorting the clothes out nearby. I greet her, she’s smiley, a conversation develops, another Anon jumps in and before we know it we’re all talking about art, paintings and so on, I ask her at what time does she finish, she says 9 and that she hasn’t been feeling too well, I salute her and leave. 

I keep going there sporadically, checking if there is any new rain/winter coat. Not really talking to anybody, really. 

One day I realize that perhaps I could have been more clear about my intentions when I asked her at what time she would have finished her shift. I look for her but she’s not in sight, I ask another staff member if she’s around and I get told that she wasn’t feeling well and she was on leave. 

I Hadn’t been going to Anon Shop since a while, and when I did I hadn’t talked to anybody. 

One day I’m in there looking around, she passes by and says “Hi how are you?..” but I was too distracted to notice her and answer and greet her in time 

Today I go there to check again about rain/winter coats. I see her there and greet her again, I try to explain her what I meant when I had asked her at what time she would have finished her shift, but she rumbles that I shouldn’t have asked other staff members if she was on leave, I was about to clarify that I didn’t ask that and that I was only looking for her, but decide that an apology would have been better, she asks me to wait and walks to the desks, she meets with the other staff member that I previously asked about her, they turn around, grin, she calls the security and this old bald man walks up to me telling me to leave and that every time I was in there I was harassing the staff members (completely false), I try to explain my version but he didn’t want to listen to any reason and threatened to have me arrested... 

So apparently I’m not allowed in the Anon Shop “anymore”... 

I believe that’s unfair and I don’t understand why of such an harsh treatment, the way she initially behaved towards me might have lead me to see something that apparently was not there, but she did seem to be very interested when talking to me... I mean all I needed was just a “No” and I would have moved on.

They constantly talk about how other friends have wronged them by ghosting or dumping them and how I am the only person they have left. They have mentioned thoughts of suicide and self harm on multiple occasions, but refuse to get help. 

We were classmates in an English class and from there I guess they made up their mind to befriend me. I didn’t interact with them much, but they started following me around and talking to me near constantly. I obliged them, and from there they never left me alone.

In a very long and uncomfortable text conversation they came out to me as bi, and in a moment of horribly lapsed judgement I came out to them too. I’m not sure what I was thinking, because fast forward a few weeks later they outed me in front of a group of piers by saying “ARE YOU STILL GAY??” like it was hemorrhoids or something and it would clear up within the week.

Ever since I mentioned my orientation they seemed obsessed with the idea that I was in love with them, often bringing it up in conversation, and, if I denied it, following up with a ‘jk lol xD’ or something along those lines. They still never leave me alone about it to this day, despite the fact that I have made it clear that I am not interested in them in that way.

I’m pretty introverted. That’s probably obvious, since I’m on Reddit asking for advice rather than doing actually confronting my problems. Anyway, J seems convinced that they saved me by being my friend and that they have to “fix me” because I’m antisocial. Everything I tell them is in one ear out the other. No, I still haven’t watched the Good Place. No, I’m not antisocial, I’m just introverted. Yes, I’m still gay, you don’t have to ask me again in front of my classmates. No, I STILL haven’t watched the Good Place. 

I want to distance myself from them, but I’m concerned they’ll end up hurting themselves.

I don’t know what to do at this point. I feel backed into a corner.

So, I’m 22F, and my boyfriend is 29M. We started dating when I was 19, and he was 26. We’d met through a close family friend (his aunt), and at the time we clicked really well, better than anyone else I had ever met. 
He and I both live in the South, and we found that we both shared a common distaste for the lifestyle that the families around us loved. I didn’t have plans to get married and pop out kids because I wanted to grow a career first, and he really respected that, in fact praised it. We both have fields in IT, and we shared hobbies of gaming and we had similar senses of dark humor, and I really valued that. 
A year goes by, and I’m having problems wanting to get intimate with him, but he understands that I’m an anxious person, and he respects my space, and I try to do intimate gestures, even if I’m not ready for sex. I let him watch me shower naked, and occasionally sent nudes. 
Last summer, we tried more because I could feel the pressure of him expecting after so patiently waiting, so I tried to give him a handjob. And at one point a few weeks later, he tried making out with me and I froze up and had a panic attack. I promised him that I would get therapy to figure out why the fuck I was having such a hard time with it, and I did. 
I spent the last six months, going through therapy and digging up a lot of possible reasons for it. Terrible sex ed that involved fear mongering, parents that didn’t give me good resources which turned me to porn, bad childhood trauma from a medical incident, and later teen trauma from a stranger online, but ultimately it brought me to realize that I’m not physically attracted to my boyfriend. 
He’s not ugly. He generally takes care of himself, and I’ve always sought out the heart more than physical appearances. He’s loving, he’s kind, he’s more than patient. He tries helping me in looking for jobs, he talks about us getting apartments, and he’s been saving for the last two years to send us to Disney. 
In the three years we’ve dated, we only had two fights, and both have been caused by myself over silly menial things. So during these six months, I’ve tried to convince myself that I’m being silly, and that I do love him, and every couple goes through a phase of not loving each other, but it’s just not enough. 
I’ve realized that because I held myself at a low self worth, I might have just settled, but that’s not really important. What is important, is that I’m no longer in love with a boy that has done nothing but worshipped me and been patient with me for the last three years. It’s selfish to waste his time, and to give false hope, or to keep him from someone who really could be THE ONE for him. 
Because I’m anxious and I’m always thinking about scenarios of how situations go, I’m terrified that he’s going to think that he’s unattractive, or that he fucked up, or that he’s not good enough for anyone and it’s so not true. I don’t know how to break up a three year relationship softly. This has been the longest relationship of my life. All previous ones had been a few weeks at a time during highschool, and I’m his first real girlfriend.

My popular friends were trying to convince me to ask her out for a month, and I kept saying no because she is so out of my league, but I succumbed to their pressure and asked her out, she said yes!

Here’s why I’m scared out of my mind- I have ZERO classes with her and haven’t talked with her this year. I don’t know if she likes me, or said yes out of kindness or a desire to go. Im sure she was fairly exited to be asked because she can go with her friends now. 

(Just in case anyone’s wondering, Im not ugly and actually quite handsome, I’m just not too popular because I lean on the shy side)

Since both of us will be in our element, we are both surrounded by our close friends, will it be that awkward? Is it weird to go to prom with a stranger? Do my friends know something they’re not telling me, and that’s why they convinced me to ask her?

Later, they broke up and she rebounded with this jerk (17M) who was really controlling and it was hell for me. Then she became super attached to the first guy she was dating and I don't know if it's a mental thing, but she is obsessed with this guy and always talks about him while I'm sitting next to her dying inside. 

I think I really fell in love with her recently. Her boyfriend left for basic in the airforce last month and I've been the main guy she hangs out with, but every so often she mentions the guy in the airforce and my heart breaks. I like the guy, but loving her makes me hate him. 

I took this job that wasn't fun just so I could talk to her as we carpooled to and from and I think she really enjoys my company because she sits next to me at stuff and gets close. But I still think she is obsessed with airforce dude. Recently she told me about her having problems with depression and wanting to cut, but she's better and I want to tell her she's beautiful and I love her, but airforce dude always is in between us. I want to ask her to prom since airforce guy graduated and I don't know who she'd go with. 

Should I just move on? I don't think I can because I see her often and it hurts everytime. I hate how she puts herself down and makes airforce guy her God. I want to sweep her up and protect her.

P.S. We are both devoted Christians and so is airforce guy.

She also thinks I’m being “a little extra” by going ahead and establishing my rules that no one can kiss my baby’s face and everyone needs the recommended vaccinations to be around my baby.

She remarried when I was 7 and my sister was five, to a guy she'd been dating for a couple of years. When I was 12, our mom told us she was pregnant, and everyone was cool with it, except my sister. Not long after, my sister told a counselor at school that my step-dad was raping her at night.

It turned into a full investigation, where it was eventually proven that he was (she had a ton of scars and stuff apparently, and our stepdad had pictures of her on his computer).

I've been with my boyfriend for two years now, we will call him B.
B is a great boyfriend, he occasionally suffers from depression that hes is usually pretty quiet about. He works two jobs and is actively working incredibly hard to start his own business. 
B and I moved in together officially about 6 months ago, although I was sleeping there nearly every night when since a few months into our relationship. At first I was fairly hesitant to move in, however he kept insisting that it would be great for our relationship as well as to save/accumulate furniture for a future together.
B and I have a really good relationship.  We are both actively working hard to build our careers (hes 26, I'm 22f) and are entirely supportive of it all for one another. 
However, B is a really thick headed guy. Hes very much so his way or the highway. Although generally not an issue as I'm pretty laid back and dont put up a fuss about too many things. In fact I like to think I'm a pretty damn good girlfriend. 
B has always had a temper. Always. But lately hes been resorting to things such as hitting..
For example, last night my boyfriend got home late after a pretty difficult night and was very hesitant to talk. I tried to give him his space, and instead tried to make him laugh. I'll be honest, I was being a bit immature. And was poking him, kissing him and trying to grab his hand. Generally this is something that he would usually laugh at and play along with as we both tend to joke around and invade each others space a bit. 
He told me to stop a few times. But me thinking he was just playing around as well, continued although toned it down. His response to wail off and punch me directly in the arm. I got visibly upset and had a brief argument with him which resulted in him only saying I gave him no other choice. There was no apology, no sympathy. 
This is far from the first time this has happened. I have a scar on my hand from him twisting/pulling my thumb until its painful when i'm being annoying. I constantly have bruises on my legs from him kicking me (he was a soccer player).
It's just getting to the point where it's no longer a joke. I come from a family of domestic violence and I told him this is the one thing that would ever make me fall out of love with me. I have told him I'm beginning to not feel safe around him and his only response is you leave me no other choice.
Although repetitive, I don't feel like it's at the point where I'm able to leave someone I see a future with. But at the same point I don't know what to do, or where to turn. The last thing I want is to lose him.

In fact I have always been very respectful to women, although I made previous posts asking about this because I did self exploring about this and I am a relatively insecure guy.

I have autism and psychosis and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as several other diagnoses. I’m ok with the fear of horror movies if they have a serious plot so know it’s not so bad that I am a complete wimp. I don’t think I am weak. I stand up for myself. I have stood up for people of both genders to bullies before especially in high school. I am told I have good looks without asking how I look as far as my face goes. But I’m overweight. It’s due to a medication that I used to be on, that I was was recently taken off of and now I think I am just starting to lose weight rapidly but am still overweight.

I am not physically strong or in good shape and I am again overweight which I think isn’t helping me.

Another thing that probably isn’t helping me is the fact that I cannot ever talk about my fucked up personal interests because it will ruin my reputation because my interests that I am obsessed with are heavily looked down upon. This probably won’t help me. I am honest about it with people I love but if I am honest about those interests then anyone will hate me, not just women. I have tried bringing them up with people.

I don’t hit women. I don’t hit men if I can avoid it. I literally don’t think I would hit a woman if she pulled out a knife on me and she was an MMA fighter. And I am not nearly that strong or good at martial arts and I would probably just let her beat me up even if I was.

Obviously I hate being controlled and taken advantage of and that already happens outside of dating so why wouldn’t that happen within dating and I’m a REALLY naive guy. I’m self aware but I’m very naive.

One night I posted a thread where I vented about some things about life and my depression issues and I didn't expected anything more than a few replies, but after a couple of days I received a message from a 20 yo guy. 

He told me he decided to write me a private message because it was more personal and he started telling me about his life and how he had similar issues etc 

He offered to keep comunicating through FB and this was like more at the end of December. We ended up talking A LOT for hours about a lot of things we clicked on instantly.

He listened to all my problems, gave me a lot of life advice, offered to help with math (he is at uni and he is really good at scientific subjects). 

His messages are always really long and during Christmas Holidays we talked nearly everyday. Now he is busier so we chat (usually) a couple of times a week or so and we always have something to say to each other etc

It began as a online friendship but lately I started crushing on him. I didn't know if it was a good idea to tell him but last time we chatted I ended up telling him everything.

It started in a rather ambiguous way; at some point he randomly asked me if I received attention from guys lately (I thought it was weird because he knows how socially isolated I am and I don't go out so often). Then he told me that several girls asked him out in real life but he refused because he is too busy and not interested in romance. 

I told him about my feelings and he replied that he figured that out (he studied psychology, so he used that to predict it) and he thanked me for my honesty.

He told him that I can't figure out a person through chatting only, but for me it is a real crush (I rarely crush on people though, it is probably my first real infatuation for someone).

When I asked him how he felt about all of this, he told he didn't know how to answer. He feels more productive (he studies a lot at uni) and emotions dampens abilities, so he avoids romance and dating in general.

He said that I am a great person and he enjoys talking to me but he doesn't really know about the 'feeling about someone' part. He was just curious about me so he asked me that question about guys, but he didn't mean anything else than that.

I pretty much ended the convo because it was really late in my country (I am from Europe and he is from Canada and he said 'talk to you later', plus he asked me to send him pics of the place where I live (he is curious about it) and we haven't talked since (a few days actually)

I decided I don't want to message him again (I messaged him first for the last couple of times, but generally he is the one starting the convo), I think he should be the one looking for me after this.

He had one short-lived relationship only in the past but the girl cheated on him and he hasn't dated since. He said it was really important for him because it was his first and he felt betrayed. He even punched the guy the girl slept with! I really like him and I don't know to 'interpret' all of this. He never said 'I only see you as a friend' but he directly told me that he has a lack of interest for this stuff.

I'm not sure if he is scared to get hurt (he rejected more than one girl at uni) or if he is apathetic over this aspect. Some people told me that I should detach myself from him and that I am getting too close or that I shouldn't trust him in general, but I am sure he is a real person and he seems a nice guy (polite, respectful, sweet). He reacted coldly to my feelings though. I was scared to make him umcomfortable but he told me it wasn't an issue at all.

After telling him (20 m) about how I (18 f) felt, we didn't talk for 10 days and then I decided to text him first.

We began talking normally again and generally we start conversations equally.

I didn't notice any difference in the way he acted towards me and right now he knows about my feelings.

He is still really nice, asks me how I am doing every time and he seems REALLY curious about my life in general.

I told him a lot of things about myself and the place where I live (I sent him a few pics and he told me twice he would it as a tourist).

I know he is really busy and sometimes he barely sleeps at night to keep up with uni, but we still manage to talk 1-2 a week/every 10 days, without considering the time zone (I am from Europe and he is from Canada).

He always encourages me and gives me advice about stuff (he knows I have depression and sometimes I have a really negative approach towards things and life in general).

He tells me all the time how good Canada is and it basically seems a safe haven, completely different from here.

He was shocked when I told him how is life here (including how people are, school, work and mentality in general). Nothing terrible but here it is kind of depressing and I realised I need to move sooner of later (he suggested the same thing more than once).

He offered to help me in math plenty of times and he even asked to send him notes of what I was doing in school and pics of the place where I will do intership.

He tells me what he does at uni and the the type of things he studies or researches they do at his uni etc (He boasts a little about himself in a indirect manner all the time but ok lmao)

Our convos are always long and last time I had to interrupt it because it was like 6 am and we began talking at 2.00-3.00 am.

At the end of the conversations he says 'talk to you later' 'we can talk tomorrow' if he is busy.

He uses a few emoji sometimes such as the winky one (idk if it's relevant) and we start the chatting equally, more or less.

As I said in the other post, I have a lil crush for him and he knows about it. His reaction seemed ambiguous to me...Idk if I am delusional because I have some feelings for him or something is up. There are some signs that he might like me but I cannot be sure.

His answer when I asked him was kinda ambiguous.

Is he just friendly or there's something more? There're some signs but as a whole they don't actually mean anything,  I don't want to delude myself...

He wasn't embarrassed or umcomfortable when I told him about my feelings and right now he acts as if it never happened.

I can't stop thinking about it and I would like to hear your option if you have more experience with this type of things.

What do you think? (Please read the other post for the whole thing, so this post makes more sense)

Sorry for my english, it isn't my first language btw

P.S: I know that having a relatioship with this guy is unlikely but I still have doubts, I want to clear up my mind.

I hope this doesn't sound ridiculous lol

This is my personal stance, and I've told all of my family and friend's this from the start and that it is not acceptable in my life because that person is deemed untrustworthy from that point.

My friend, let's call her Patricia, has just found a new guy who she had been excited about him 'treating her right' and all that. Months pass and he starts saying how he's questioning their relationship and doesn't know if he is ready for it. She thinks it's basically over and yada yada. Our group consoles her, tells her she'll be okay. A day later she tells us all he cheated. He had texted a friend of his and said gross things like 'Hey I got really fire p***y last night and it wasn't Patricia's'. His friend then told Patricia, which is how she found out   

Being the person I am with the morals I have, which she is very aware of, I freak out, I'm sending her videos telling her she doesn't deserve this because she's awesome, and I wish I could hug her and tell her she shouldn't have to do this (Again, she's been cheated on before and left the dude). 

This just in, as I was talking to her and trying to cheer her up, I get the text saying she took him back because he told her everything that happened front to back and said that the girl took advantage of him. Even though he BRAGGED about it to a friend. Drunk or not, no person who was taken advantage of would brag about cheating on someone they were apparently in love with. 

I've been in contact with Patricia since he cheated and when she sent the message saying that she took him back yesterday night, I was going to reply telling her a repeat of my morals and why that doesn't fly and how I can not support the relationship she is trying to hold on to, I stopped myself, deleted it all and have not talked to her since. I don't know what to say because she 100% doesn't have any type of my support, I would like to not lose her as one of my bestest friends, but it's hard because this is such a high moral of mine. 

Mostly I don't know what I should reply to her text. I don't know if I should ignore the relationship, tell her I can't support it, cut her out (which I really don't want to do) 

DISCLAIMER:

She has been a drug addict for over 20 years, with some years of sobriety in between. She also has an 8 year old child that is currently in the custody of other family members. My sister's paranoia is growing more and more. She has put her child and other family members children at risk. For example, it was raining very hard one day and she shows up early in the morning, grabs her child and a family members child and starts driving east. She ""had it on good authority"" that it was going to flood. It was not going to flood. Before anyone had time to react (early AM, everyone was sleeping), she was gone with the kids. We were able to get the children back safely a few hours later, but not without a tremendous amount of stress. She also believes that the FBI is out to get her and that family members are working with the FBI. There have been 2 instances that the family has involved CPS, but my sister would duck and hide from them, so we received zero help. She also beat my mother so hard that my mom had bruises all over her chest. (My mom did not tell me until weeks later). At that point, my parents kicked her out of their house. She also believes that a senator has her under surveillance and believes that her child's life has been threatened.  

So, the advice that I am seeking is how do we protect the child? As I said, the child is with family currently. But, my sister can come at any moment and take the child. With my sister's paranoia seemingly getting worse, my family is growing increasingly worried. Also, the father of the child is around, but doesn't show much of an interest in turning his life around to have the child permanently.

I have a BA degree in lighting design. I've designed for theatre, corporate, concert, and many places in between. 

6 months ago I was let go from a company that I thought of as family. I was reassured it was budgetary and it wasn't something they wanted to do, but they still did it. They still wanted me to freelance with the company but it wasn't going to be consistent enough to support me and my wife.  

So I found a new job with a much larger company. I received a significant raise, better benefits, less stress, and more flexibility. Almost over night every complaint I had about my old job this company fixed. Effectively a dream job. 

Then about a week ago, I was on a show, everything had gone smoothly, client was thrilled, and then a mental switch went off and I was done. I didn't want my career anymore. I felt like I had achieved everything I wanted from lighting and didn't want to go further/longer. I struggle to even think of a new goal.

So now I'm trying to figure out a new career life plan.

I'm interested in going back to school for mechanical engineering. I don't know anyone in this field or even have a strong grasp on everything the job entails but it just feels like the ""right thing"". I guess you could describe it as a eureka or if you're spiritual a message from the universe or God. 

As I've been looking more and more into Mechanical Engineering it seems to be perfect for me. 

Strong Design Focus
Problem Solving
Team goals and personal goals
CAD drawings
Math 
Hands on Work
Project driven
Tangible Achievements

So here's my Plan:
Stay full time with current company for nest egg/security
Go back to community college for AA mathematics
Online classes, slower paced 
Switch to freelance/part time
Transfer to a state School for Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering hit full time fast
Figure out new career

TLDR
I'm done with my career as a Lighting Designer
I'm thinking a new career as a Mechanical Engineer after some school. What do you folks think?

General advice? Am I going about this rationally? Am I grossly mislead on what I'm doing?

So in my boyfriend’s culture, they use bidets. I totally get it. I understand and I sympathize. A few months ago, the first time he entered my new house I presented him with alternate option to bidets because I knew he was worried about it. 

I told him - 
1. Here are some butt wipes. 
2. You can also just fill this water bottle and use while you’re on toilet - same concept right? 
3. You can also use the shower. 
4. Sorry I don’t have a bidet-this is America. We just don’t have them. 
5. I SPECIFICALLY asked him NOT TO USE THE SINK TO WASH HIS ASS. (Which he had done before in my previous house - so I made sure to cover my bases. That sink didn’t have other areas to put my stuff, this one had more surface) 

Same or next day, there is water all over my sink... and I ask him “hey... did you wash your butt in there after doing your do... even though I specifically asked you not to?”

Of course he denies but eventually he admits it because it was too obvious. 

I got really angry but I tried to use general logic and common sense and hygiene for my argument. 
1. My contacts live there- this is how people get pink eye
2. Despite what you believe, you can’t control where the water is splashing and even if I can’t see the actual brown of your crap, the water you are splashing has the bacteria in it and it’s everywhere 
3. My TOOTHBRUSH is there. (Not to mention he is so unaware of his surroundings that he often drops my toothbrush in the sink)
4. Other general things I use at my sink to keep myself clean are there. And you’re spreading your literal crap all over.  
5. I wash my face there. My hands.
6. If you have a problem like this, just tell me and we can think of other methods rather than resorting to something like this. 
7. It’s just gross. End of story. 

He apologized just to apologize. But tells me he can’t believe he’s being questioned on his hygiene and doesn’t really see a problem with it. And is so sure that him just wiping away the dirty water with just more water will fix the problem. And that the crap water can’t possibly be splashing on my toothbrush... 

I realize I will never get him to understand, so I tell him-regardless of what you believe, this is my place, it’s my sink, you have alternate ways of cleaning your hole, so please don’t do it (again). 

*Same week, I find that he has done it again.*

At this point I am fuming - not at his general lack of common sense and hygiene, but his inability to follow simple directions. 

We had a long fight after that- same bs argument on his part. And some additional stuff like “I was distracted. I wasn’t paying attention.” THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU ARE DISTRACTED. ITS A LONG PROCESS. THIS IS INTENTIONAL. YOU HAD TO INTENTIONALLY DECIDE THAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS THING KNOWING HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. 

He said my alternate options weren’t good/viable options. He said he hasn’t killed anyone or committed a crime - and clearly doesn’t understand the problem. 

Regardless, he promised he wouldn’t do it again. 

It’s been a few months now and he is visiting again - I thought we were really past this. But today - NEW APARTMENT, WHERE I ALSO STRESSED THIS TOPIC, I walked into the bathroom and found his pants down in front of my sink with the sink all wet. 

He denied again - but I saw actual brown spots on my sink as he was trying to wipe them away so I wouldn’t see. 

He said he was trying to be fast and washing his butt in the tub would have taken too long. Idk what world he lives in... but I’m pretty sure struggling to clean your arse in the sink takes way longer and more effort than just sitting on the edge of a tub and turning on the bottom stream of water and using exactly like you would with a bidet. 

I am so angry beyond belief. I don’t even know what to say anymore. 

He said sorry again... but at this point....fool me 3+ times - I must be out of my mind to think this is going to get resolved. And if he were actually sorry, and understood the issue, he wouldn’t have done it. 

Even if he doesn’t understand the problem with it, if we have argued about this and I have asked him not to in my house multiple times - he should just be able to follow directions regardless. 

I am sure he has done it other times too without my knowledge.

My dad's claiming his email got hacked and someone was sending nasty emails, my mom found the emails and got mad. My dad talked to me about what happened, from his POV, and wants me to tell my mom.

I'm a 15 year old guy and I'm mainly worried for my family, especially my sister.  I won't do anything dumb or stupid, just looking for advice.

To start, my mom left to go somewhere (Most likely for finding out), before I knew all of this my dad asked me to help him and was saying his email got hacked, he asked me to go with him. I agreed and for some reason he took me to Office Depot, before we went in he said that my mom thinks he's seeing someone. We went to Office Depot because he was there that day before he came home and brought me there to talk to an employee to confirm he was there that day saying she saw him and there were cameras. 

Going back home he claims he didn't do it, showing me his phone, he showed me his emails which was weird because it didn't show any sent emails. He showed me his texts and all other messaging apps, mainly his trading apps, like Craigslist and those selling apps. He's saying he got hacked and such. He wants me to tell my mom the truth and basically convince her. Going home my mother wasn't home and my dad said he's not going home and tell my mom to come home. When I got home I saw that his computer was on and it was on his email (when my mom saw it), I decided to do some research myself and went on it. (I know it was a bad idea, but I had to...) 

From what I saw. that a month ago he made a Craigslist post saying he wasn't getting enough sexually and was looking for someone... I read email responses from strangers asking about his info, when can you meet up, and the info he gave was right, location, info about his work etc. I got kinda mad and emailed this one lady he was talking to. All the links in all the emails were flagged on Craigslist and were down. One important thing is that on each email, it showed that they were all forwarded to my mom's email, whether he did that or my mom did, I don't know. I had saw enough and left, and haven't told my mother yet. 

That night I stayed up late playing video games to just relax and heard my dads truck pull up in the driveway. It was about 2 am and I shut off my computer and went to my bed. He went inside for like 5 minutes then left. I went to sleep and woke up at like 3 am hearing my parents arguing, not yelling, but I could hear them. I couldn't understand what they said but I tried to ignore it and went to sleep. 

He's going to quit his job apparently, he doesn't care he said but that will affect us a lot. He didn't get really mad which was different from him. 

It is now a day later and I'm not sure what I should do, my dad texted me asking if I told her, I said no and he said I have to. He texted me again and I just ignored it. I'm not really sure what to do, I don't even know if I believe in my dad, he sounded sincere, he gets up at 4 am for work and gets home at around 6-8 pm, he doesn't have much time. But I saw the emails, whether they were hacked or not, all the info was correct, but they were all sent to my mom and he tried to show her the texts and emails saying he was hacked. I am in the middle of this, I'm pretty sure it's too late to stop, but I don't know what to do. Any advice or just thoughts would be nice, I got really lazy and didn't want to type this all, but if you ask questions I will surely clarify more and add more details.

This has happened to me several times and I'm beginning to think that it's 50/50: Either the girl is overreacting or I'm doing something wrong? I'll give you an example:

At college parties, (I'm currently a junior), there are times when random girls would accuse me of being weird/creepy when I did nothing wrong at all. I understand that drunkeness affects people in different ways, but it's quite interesting when one girl is hugging everyone at the party, while another girl may be paranoid about everything.

She is 15 years old (not a whole year less than me, just 8 months of difference), blonde with blue eyes, very european looking although mexican too, 5'1 and lesbian (or bi, I dont really remember, I only know she really like's girls). 

This all occurred this weekend at a camping trip with my training team. It wasnt a training camp trip though, we actually played some drinking games and partied last night, but this happened the first night.

You see, the first day we made some challenges to decide who was going to sleep with whom on what part of the camp. There was three teams and three spots far away from each other but to make the story short my team won (partially because of me) and we got the best spot. We had 2 tents, one for 2 people and the other one for 5. We where 5 on the team, 6 with the leader, so the leader slept on the small one and we on the big one.

Here's the thing, we where 2 guys and 3 girls, so it was mixed. We also didn't went to sleep at the same time so we didn't chose our places. This because me and the girl went to sleep together before anyone else.

With ""went to sleep together"" I dont mean we casually went to sleep at the same time, and with ""the girl"" I dont mean she was some random girl, she is a friend and she's actually the only one I knew before getting on the training team since we go to the same school. We agreed to go to sleep because it was kinda late already (12:15am) and we where both sleepy. 

At first we layed down a bit separated from each other and started talking about each other. We spent like an hour just laying down and talking until we finally decided to sleep. Of course since 3 other people where going to sleep on the same tent we couldn't stay on our initial places, so they pushed us all the way to the right and we ended up all cramped. 

I only noticed this like an hour after when I woke up trying to accommodate myself since I was very uncomfortable and got even more trying to give space to my friend. The whole night was shitty. From a healthy sleeping standpoint. Out of the 7 hours I was on the tent I only could sleep 4. Let alone the others that slept 2 hours. 

But this isnt the main point of the story, I aint writing an entire reddit post just because I slept 20 fucking cm of a ""female"". Im not that pathetic. 
The shit starts at the morning, when the other guys started leaving and we where left more space. 

It was around 6-7am when everyone started waking up and leaving that we started getting closer together. We where both awake for sure because of the kind of moves we where pulling. First she put her head on my arm, then on my shoulder, then I on hers, etz. Long story short, we ended up cuddled on the same pillow with she hugging me in a big spoon-small spoon manner, except I was facing upwards. She was so close I could hear her breath almost in my ear. The other guys even joked around saying that we where pretty much about to kiss each other. 

This was very warm and cute and overall felt pretty good since I have been very lonely for big part of my life. I have never had a girlfriend and I blame myself for being such a fucking retard in middle school and not socializing. I swear to god I was on the path of becoming a pathetic incel if it wasn't for the fact that I always despised and looked down on them losers, even when I was a fucking loser that wasted so much opportunities to get actual friends and a gf. But Im not anymore, Ive changed. 

Still, I dont really know how to swallow this. As I said already, I barely have experience on close friendships and even less in romance. Although I want to really remark this. Even though she is extremely pretty, I swear to god she is one of the most beautiful people Ive seen in my life, I dont feel sexual attraction. I really like her, she has a gorgeous face, good body and attitude. But I dont desire her in a sexual manner. Maybe it is the fact that Im almost an entire foot taller than her, or that she hasnt got that much chest. She's just not like the other girls I fantasize with. She is beautiful, not hot. 

I want her as a friend, a close friend. Someone that can rely on me and I on. But I dont really know much about all that friendship stuff. So I would really accept some advice on whats our current friendship status and how to get us closer together.

I live and work in Sweden for the local authority/municipality as a cleaner in our hospital, there are several branches for the municipality but I’ve worked for the “cleaner” one for about three months now.

The other day I got a doctors appointment, at 1pm on a Friday which is scheduled as work time, I asked for time off five days in advance and one of my bosses said she’d had to discuss with the other bosses if it was okay. I later got an OK but was advised to keep appointments on my private time. Is this correct? Am I not allowed to see a doctor and ask for time off? 

Another thing that has happened is about my 21 year old colleague, she got sexually harassed by another employee, male 23. And told our boss, who set up a meeting with him and her even though she specifically said she did not want to sit in the same room as him. They also allowed him to bring a friend as he felt he was faulty accused, what the hell? My colleague was extremely uncomfortable but went to the meeting where she was met with disbelief and a comment from our boss “maybe you didn’t tell him enough that you weren’t interested and maybe part of this is your fault too, maybe you’re too inviting”. The male quit shortly after this so it was never addressed again.

Everyone that works here, except a few full time cleaners, is employed by the hour, this is good since I am a part-time student and we can chose our own schedules and work as much as we want. I help out as much as I can at work but they still shame you if you can’t work when they want you to, I’ve been asked to quit studying, to skip school a specific day because they need people and when I say no they get pissy. Our contract says we have to work at least two times during a span of two weeks, which I well enough am. I work four-five days a week and sometimes weekends.

This is just a few things that have happened during the short time I’ve worked here, but I feel like this isn’t right. Is there anything I can or should do about this? I’ve heard of people getting fired for speaking their minds as the higher ups seem to be friends with some of our bosses and managers. I’m told that’s why no one has done our said anything.

My mom is the type of mother who likes things a certain way and often gets offended when criticized. I love her but I understand the annoyance. My sister is also in school and living off my mom's cooking, cleaning, and money. They are in this state of relationship where I could very well see them separating as well. My mom is a good person and does love the both of us. I love her too. She has suffered a lot of trauma from the relationship she has had with my father. She still receives the money in order to live and he gives it out of duty. Its a fucked situation. I stopped receiving his money but my sister is using it in order to go to school and pay for rent.

I’ve been working at my local grocery store here in Australia in the produce dept. for almost 6 years now (I’m 23), I started here when I just finished up school. At the time I was hired another guy who was in the same position was hired as well, both of us casuals. We weren’t ever really close but we got to know each other quite well since being hired at the same time. Fast forward a year and his sister was hired to work on the registers. When I first met her she was super nice and pretty cute but I didn’t want to pursue anything because she was still in school (although only 2 years younger than me) and was my co-workers sister. That was that, we always had normal chats, she constantly asked me how I put up with her brother. I remember one night when the store was being remodelled we had to park our cars across the road because the usual staff car park was being demolished and built over. Managers always made sure we left in couples or groups and never alone because the area is very shady and after dark it just isn’t fun to be around alone. Anyway we walked to our cars just us two and chatted along the way, not sure why I remember that moment specifically but it was nice just to chat.

This continued for a very long time and I was fine with it, never thought about being anything other than friends. I always thought that she had stronger feelings for me, but now I’m not sure and I’m seconding guessing myself about this but at the time when we spoke to each other I always thought to myself that she might have had stronger feelings.

For some reason just recently (let’s say sometime in the last 2 or so months) I was talking to her on a tea break and something just clicked, I don’t know what it was but suddenly I knew that I wanted to be more than friends. Usually with these sorts of things anxiety gets the better of me and I always think that I’m not good enough for someone and I talk myself out of it, at first that’s what I did but I’d try and force myself to shut those thoughts out asap. I’ve always hated work and I’ve been trying to get out but all of a sudden I was looking forward to work, the opportunity to see her again and to just talk to her. I work Monday and Friday nights and all day on Sundays, she works Friday nights and all day Sunday as well, so we’d time our breaks to coincide with each other. Because of the way timetables are scheduled differently between produce and front end I’d always start either 15 or 30 minutes before her and I made it a habit to be stocking the front tables when she started so I got to see her walk in and say hi.

Before working last night (Friday night) I told myself I was going to ask her if she wanted to grab a coffee on Sunday during our tea breaks. Usually this kind of thing makes me beyond nervous and stressed but this time I just felt so confident, I was ready. So we go on our breaks last night and the idea was to ask if she was working Sunday then see if she’d be interested in grabbing a coffee. So I asked,

“You working on Sunday?”

She suddenly got visibly uncomfortable and told me that no she isn’t working because she’s going to Europe to visit some family for a bit then she’s doing a Contiki tour for 6 weeks. My stomach sank and immediately I felt sick, she had never mentioned this up until now. My mind suddenly thought she must be quitting, I won’t see her again, 6 weeks is so long. We talked about it for a while and as we were heading back to work I asked her if she’ll be coming back after 6 weeks. She stopped and told me that she is rostered to return and hasn’t quit but while she is over there she’ll be looking for a job and would stay if something we’re to come up. Since then I’ve felt empty and alone, I didn’t even get to say goodbye because she wasn’t around when I was leaving. I can’t sleep because I can’t stop thinking about her, food taste like nothing, and I want to cry. I need to talk to someone but I don’t feel like there is anyone I can speak to in this moment. Even now I’m writing this paragraph with tears slowly dripping down my cheeks. I don’t know what to do. I have work in the morning and it’s the last place I want to be.

Anyway, here goes I guess. So I've always been close with my mom. When I was 12, she moved in with her boyfriend who had four boys, and I already have a brother, so it was 6 boys, me and my mom. Naturally, I just got close to her because she was the only other female that I had in a chaotic situation. I told her literally everything. When I lost my virginity when I was 17, I told her (more on this later). Point is, we were really close through my preteen and teen years.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I guess I should add that I've pretty much always had problems with mental health. I have PMDD, which is a pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder, which means that I basically have PMS on crack. Ever since I had a period, I've had wild mood swings. Every single period, every single month, I'd have suicidal thoughts and be stuck in bed all day. The reason why I mention this is that it took *over 5 years to get on birth control.* I suffered through this for over 5 years, by myself. You might be asking-- why is this relevant to your mom's boundary issue?  Well, she pretends like she is there for me, so it's like I owe her something. But she isn't. She let me suffer on my own and  left me to deal with my own emotions. I asked for years, she watched me suffer, but didn't help. A few years later, at 19, I ask about anti-depressants because I was just feeling anxious and numb. I got on Zoloft and am feeling like a normal human being for the first time since I was 10. She has never been any help through any of my mental health struggles. I asked to go to therapy, but this was all over-shadowed by health issues that my family had.

&amp;#x200B;

Thr main health problem to add is that my brother (M16) was diagnosed with brain cancer at 14. Mom thinks that this is the trigger for all of mental health issues (hint, it isn't). Obviously, it adds to everything, but I have a different experience than they do. She doesn't care to learn about my experience. Every time I try to have a serious conversation with her, she is on her phone, scrolling through Facebook. It just feels that she doesn't care about me, my thoughts, or my emotions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hence, why I chose to live with my dad. They live in the same neighborhood. Literally 5 minutes away from each other. Now she is bitter because I'm not living there (oh, it was half time before. One week at each house). I waited to move in with my Dad until I was 19 (after my first year of college) because I knew it would've been a shitshow in high school. My brother, of course, wants to do it too because he likes to spend time with his sister. She blames me for that, so I try to tell my brother that it is important to stay at Mom's because he is not 18 yet. She just makes me feel so guilty for making a decision that I have the authority to make. Oh, and she also gets mad when I say my college town is home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate coming back home because she is just so suffocating. She demands to know things about my love life that I am not comfortable sharing with her. That's really my biggest problem. I went out on a casual date on Tuesday, and she is pestering me about another date. She asks if I've kissed/had sex/etc. with my dates. I told her that it wasn't her business and she got offended. She said that I was her business. I don't want to feel like the asshole, but I also know that I need my private space and my boundaries, and it feels like she is crossing them.  

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing she does is demand that I help her with chores around the house. I will come to visit, often after work, and she will make me go do *her* laundry, even though she didn't work the whole day and was watching TV. I don't mind doing things for her, but at this point, I do so much for her that isn't being reciprocated emotionally or physically. Many kids come home from college and their mom does laundry and helps them with their stuff, but I end up doing everything for her, in addition to my chores and errands. I feed myself most of the time. I pay for (most) of my own stuff. I pay for ALL of my schooling. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't really know what to do at this point. She has been pushing my boundaries and really frustrating me. If anyone has dealt with any of these boundary issues from parental figures after coming home from college, please let me know. Thank you.

I really really want to go to an English speaking country to continue my studies but I have several things in my way.

We're really poor, father died when I was 9 from ALS, single mother works for ~250 dollars a month, also have a sister 7 years younger than I am. Basically those 250 dollars a month are what we have.

Now if I do succeed in this dream of mine I've calculated that, from all relatives and such, I could get around 350$ sent to me monthly which is not enough for the average 25000$ a year college and university. Now I'm willing to work while attending classes and do as much as possible.

I don't care much about the place or if it's a university or a community college, if I truly had to choose one place I'd chose Chicago because it's quite literally the second city with most Serbs ( first being capital of my country, Belgrade, I live in Nis which is 3rd biggest with little over 150K while I saw somewhere that Chicago has ~400K )

I planned on taking TOEFL over the summer but it's quite a big gamble, taking TOEFL costs 180$ which I have saved but it's still a lot of money, compare it to our monthly income. Also I sadly can't apply to too many colleges / universities because applications cost a lot.

My GPA is around 3.7 when converted into American GPA, so it's good I'd say.

Haven't worked a day in my life, not because I don't want to but because people here don't work while in High School.

I was always busy and I always knew something fun was coming.  I didnt go to any classes but i definitely had the time of my life.  Slept around a lot, won a few grand gambling, day drinking all the time, saw a bunch of concerts, it was dope.  I roomed with two drug dealers and a bunch of party boys so we always had these crazy coked out parties and everyone would swing by.

Well after college I fell back into good ol deppression and I was struggling for a few months.  I litteraly did nothing at all during this period, quit my job and kinda just moped around.  But my mind was going 1000 miles an hour and it was like a constant battle against myself.  Even though I wasnt doing anything I felt like I had so much going on in my head that I was always busy.

My friends ex boyfriend is really weird.

He is a guard at a refugee camp and he’s just really creepy. Basically forced her to convert to Shia Muslim. Anyway he eventually abused her enough for her to call it quits 3 months ago. He texts her 2 days ago saying “I’m out the front to say goodbye I’m moving to Perth” (we live in Victoria) 
She decides to just go on a road trip with him. 
The road trip has roads that go for 2 days straight with basically no rest stops and no service....  
I made her sign up for an app that lets me track her and her battery percentage.
She left on Thursday morning and called me that night, then Friday no contact except for a few texts at 7 pm. She didn’t charge her phone last night. Which is so weird. She’s connected to her phone like no other actually gets therapy for her phone addiction. No text no calls this morning. App hasn’t been able to locate her phone since last night.

Her mum rang me and said that she hasn’t talked to her since Thursday night and she’s super worried and scared because she always gets a text etc. Now I don’t know what to do. What if we are overreacting, but what if he’s done something to her in the middle of nowhere.

I currently am working a job with a two month on, one month off schedule. I'd say the pay is above average and I could do really well for myself here. In my off time I live in a place that I really love. I have two really good friends there and my family is pretty close by. That's about it though. The two months away from home can honestly be a bit of a struggle at times.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend so my future is pretty wide open at this point.

I have an opportunity to take a different job in the state and town that I grew up in. This job will pay about $45k more a year, full benefits, and it's a cake job. It's on call 365 days a year, with very little to do throughout the year. The only catch is, I can't leave the surrounding areas unless it's during my PTO (which I would get about 4 weeks a year). The town can be pretty boring and redundant after a while, so the only real benefit to taking this leap would be more financial security.

I'm overwhelmed with the idea that choosing either one of these careers will inevitably effect the rest of my life.

I was raised by my grandma, meaning that he was basically not present in my life until I was forced to live with him when my grandma passed away and I was still underage.

We live in Hungary, which is an extremely poor and hard country to live in. We have $600 debt to the landlord of the house we live in right now. The rent is $300 monthly, and I've been paying it all alone while also paying for food and other expenses such as his cigarettes. He refuses to work, gives excuses, makes a mess, and regularly starts fights with me in which he says horrible things about me. I'm unable to pay rent and debt alone, meaning that we're getting evicted January 1st.

Through my only friend here in Hungary, I have the opportunity to move out and rent a room for an affordable price. There are no words to describe how much I want to be away from my father. However, I know that without me, he will die. Absolutely no doubt about it.

Obviously, the logical answer is for me to get the hell out of here, but I'm so god damn terrified of living with the thought that someone died because of me. I'm also terrified of him hurting me or breaking my belongings when I pack my stuff to move. I told him about the room today, and **he said that he doesn't want me to move out - no shit**.

I hate him, but **I don't want him to die because of my decision**. He won't be able to get a job because he has a bunch of unpaid crap, so the government would *apparently* ""block"" and take away his salary. However, I cannot take the mental abuse, and living in literal filth anymore. I refuse to clean up his mess, I'm not his wife, and I think the least he could've done is keep things tidy if he refuses to work and earn money.

I know she’s cut herself before, but that was a month ago. She’s got a good amount of friends so it’s not worrying, but still nothing to write home about.

So a friend of mine tells me how she was looking at her razors and how she was thinking about cutting herself last Tuesday. 

Slight worry.

She’s gone for a day of school(Wednesday), and I text her if she’s ok. She says she’s fine, but she’s not saying the real reason she’s out. 

Worry.

Next day(Thursday), she comes to school ***in all Long Sleeves*** + a little fingerless glove on her right hand. Basically the red flash to end all red flags of self harm. I ask her if she’s ok and she says yeah, but there no way that’s true. 

Mucho worry.

Friday, and this time she’s wearing a bandana on her left wrist, and the fingerless glove, and we have gym. She’s taken off the bandana but still has the fingerless glove on her right hand. She seems normal, but I noticed she was more depressed than normal.

Excess amounts of worry.

Monday, comes and it’s obvious she’s been crying, but she’s covered that up with a bit of makeup. Very irritable and also angry with herself for being having to much socially anxiety. Around the end of the day, she’s getting her stuff to go, and I’ve already got mine. She starts crying when I ask how her day went. I comfort her for a minute since we have to get on our buses.

If worry was equal to 1 bean, I’d have enough worry to feed a starving African nation. 

So now it’s today(Tuesday), and she seems a bit better, but she’s still got the fingerless glove on her right.

How am I supposed to ask if she’s cutting herself, and what am I supposed do if she is. I don’t wanna tell anybody in the school, cause they’ll without a doubt tell some staff member, cause as a formerly cripply depressed person, I wanna respect her privacy and I’ll tell a teacher only if I’m 100% sure she’s gonna kill her self. 

Tl;dr, pretty sure a friend is cutting herself since she’s wore a glove on her right hand since she was or for a day after saying she might go back to cutting, and I don’t know how to approach the topic, and I don’t wanna tell anyone in the school for privacy reasons.",True,False,,False,Advice,t5_2qjdm,,,public,,self,,,Pretty sure my friend is cutting themself,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/82jhsz/pretty_sure_my_friend_is_cutting_themself/,all_ads,

It’s only been a year so I feel like my feelings shouldn’t be discredited yet. I don’t talk about it very often if at all to anybody except for my boyfriend and he has told me to get over it as well but he’s been very understanding towards my feelings. I feel like no matter how much I pray, journal, or talk about it in therapy, I just can’t seem to get over this one thing and occasionally it is emotionally debilitating. I feel like there’s no closure in sight because of how dirty it ended. I feel completely betrayed and I asked for closure but they refuse to even talk to me over something that was 100% a lie and I even proved it over text message which they completely ignored. I guess they just want to feel justified in their anger toward me for whatever reason. I guess it’s easier to hate me then to except the truth because of their pride.

&amp;#x200B;

About the air conditioners: they are owned by the apartment building and are installed and removed by them when they want.  They give each apartment one air conditioner and choose which window it goes in; ours is in our bedroom.  

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, I moved into the apartment in the late summer when my boyfriend and I moved in together.  He had already been living there.  I noticed a funny smell when the air conditioner was on, and so I looked at the plastic vent blades and saw what I thought was some mold.  I notified the apartment manager, and she sent a maintenance person who looked at it and told me it was dirt.  I have a picture of his report saying it was dirt as well as pictures of the air conditioner.  Not long after, they removed the air conditioner, so I didn't bother worrying about it anymore until last week when they put another one in for the summer.  It's already covered in what looks like mold, I'm assuming because of where they store them during the winter.  It also has the same musty smell as last year.

&amp;#x200B;

We're moving soon, but I don't want to be breathing this in for the next 6-7 weeks if it is mold, and I'm fairly confident that the manager is going to do absolutely nothing about it.  First off, based on the photos, do you think that this is mold?  Second, is there something that I can do to minimize my exposure to it or clean the air conditioner myself without taking it out of the window?  I've tried to take the vent blades off and can't seem to do it.  Lastly, does anyone have any suggestions on how to get through to the apartment manager that this is indeed mold?  I want to be able to just stick it out for the next 6 weeks, but I'm starting to wake up with a sore throat already within the first week of it being in our bedroom, even without turning it on.

The basic story is that my girlfriend and I have been dating pretty much all through high school, and it's a great relationship. As senior year comes to an end, we are both moving on to different but nearby colleges, which I don't expect to be an issue. She has expressed a good deal of interest in joining a sorority, which makes me a little uneasy.

I struggle with anxiety a bit and so of course this sends my mind into all sorts of worries. I'm worried a sorority will make her more promiscuous, or she'll have too much to drink and end up with someone else in bed, or that she'll be sexually assaulted, or brutal hazing, etc. The last one is less of a concern since that's becoming less common I think. I suppose I'm afraid of letting go because I've always been by her side, and I won't be able to do that when she's away. I'm afraid that me not being there will result in something bad happening.

\- Around grade 8 he started playing video games a lot

\- By grade 10 he was playing all the time and had drifted from his friend group and spent pretty much all his free time in his room.

\- In high school he pretty much had no friends, very rarely hung out with anyone (I don't remember him ever doing so but maybe a few times), but he played games with some classmates occasionally.

\- So he missed out on developing social skills and experience etc. in an important part of his life.

\- Became depressed (I think I would categorize it as such) in high school - missed 20-30 days from school every year because he played video games all night wasn't able to wake up (probably did that because he didn't have the energy to go to school). Barely talked to or engaged with his family. I have barely talked to him for 5 years. Of course random daily stuff like can I borrow your car, did you walk the dog, etc. Occasionally I ask him questions about things he knows (computers, math etc.) But pretty much no casual conversation.

\- He's now in university studying a STEM major with decent grades. He still has no friends, plays video games a lot but nowhere near as much as before. He seems interested in improving himself; he studies a lot, cooks healthy food sometimes, walks our dog and teaches him tricks.

As he is now he won't be able to live independently after university and get a job, apartment, get friends, socialize, get a girlfriend/wife/family etc.

Me and the rest of our family are supportive but it seems like my parents are afraid to talk about him not having friends etc., talk to him about it. It's very possible that he has Aspergers/Autism. Now that I write this I can't believe we haven't done anything drastic as a family in the last 5 years to help him. I'm ashamed in myself and my parents for not having the courage to bring it up and just dancing around the problem for so long.

What should I do? Talk to my parents about it first I guess. Then what? And what can I do for him personally?

I'm a 15yo girl, and I need some advice or help with understanding something.

Basically, for the past two months, I've been having this thing where I blink for long times and make this noise uncontrollably. I make a weird noise like 'hm' or I have the urge to say words with the letter 'r' in them. Sometimes I have trouble breathing, but it's not bad to the point where I'm gasping for air.

I thought that maybe it was tourettes, but I called my sister, who's fiance has tourettes, and asked her for her advice. She thinks that it might just be stress, but if I start twitching or something then I should go see a doctor. 

I was unsure, but went along with it. 

The reason I was unsure was because my dad does the same thing. When he's working or doing something, he shakes his leg and starts doing the 'hm' noise over and over. I was wondering if he'd passed off something to me when I was born, if that makes sense, and I just want to know if I'm just stressed or not because I don't feel stressed or anything. It's still summer vacation for me, and I've actually been very relaxed.

If I don't make the noises, I feel like I have a lump in my throat and have this weird feeling in my nose. To make the feeling go away, I'd have to growl or snarl for a long time, and I really hate the feeling.

I've searched online everywhere and have gotten no answers.

I've been thinking about calling my dad and asking him, but I don't know when he usually gets off of work since he lives in another state. I don't want to bother him if he's busy, so should I go to the doctor, or do I really have to worry about this?

They're all pretty different from each other but share one thing; they're all open minded and just want to have fun. But all three of them also are shy and awkward around new people they meet. 

So I was wondering how I can take the feeling away from each of them that they're the third wheel, cause none of them are.

I'll try to keep it shorter.

My mom comes over once a week most weeks to watch our 2 children so my wife (stay at home) can get it for a bit.

Problem is my mom when over here rearranges things like it's her own house. She's been doing g it since the kids have been around really some weeks a lot of things are changed sometimes it's minimal. We've told her not to do it several times over the years. Each time we confront her about it she gets upset, threatens to not watch them anymore and delays communication with us on purpose for a variable amount of time. It's always hard to bring up because I love her to death, she's doing us a favor by watching them and I know she thinks shes helping.

Most recently, just this last week my wife and I went on a small week long vacation to Arizona where she watched the kids half the time. The house wasn't our home anymore I felt violated. Didn't know where things were. For example, our older kids task list was rewritten, kitchen drawer content moved around, book shelves rearranged, our boxes gone through. I told her it's too much.

She again is threatening not coming over to babysit...so not seeing her Grand children. My mom blames her genetics and says her mom did it so we should just deal.

I'm open to criticism so please let me have it and be honest. Would I possibly be making a big deal out of nothing or is my mom out of line. Not sure what to do at this point she states she doesn't want to talk about it any longer.

Fyi we live down the street from her, pay for our house rent completely and we don't rely on my mom for anything besides relief here and there.

I have a loving family and friends and wouldn’t change. I know I should generally speaking be happy and don’t see anything to be emotional about. But the thing is that in these months it has been a real trouble because sometimes when I should be mad or sad etc I get so for a few seconds (or sometimes not at all) and just act how I feel I am supposed to. This in turn means I often go home with just a feeling of nothingness. An example could be today when I was out drinking with some friends at a theme park. Normally I’d be over the moon with joy and come home and sleep happy but today I just felt the usual snippets of happiness and then they kind of disappeared.

First off I just want to say that me and my girlfriend both suffer from Severe social anxiety. I'm 22 and she's 23. We both have serious anxiety issues. And I just want to apologize in advance if this is really long, and if I don't make much sense or misspell a lot in this post. it's late, and I've been up all night crying and worrying about my girlfriend. I really woud appreciate more than anything any advice on how me and my girlfriend can cope with the overwhelming anxiety and stress we're both going through right now. 

As the title says, my girlfriend, as of last week was told she has a brain tumor by her eye doctor a few hours after her GP told her he suspects she has some type of cancer. So she has to wait to get tests done. She's been in and out of the doctors, eye doctors, and ER for a few years now with no answers to what has been causing a blind spot in her eye, and tons of other symptoms. Until finally, about a month ago, after a trip to the emergency room, the doctors there found out she had a scotoma in her left eye (after being told for over a year straight by her eye doctor that nothing was wrong with her eye) this led to her eye doctor finding out the cause of her scotoma was a brain tumor, and the same day before she found this out, her GP told her she meets all the criteria of colon or another type of cancer, and has her scheduled to get blood tests done this Monday to find out more.

 Now she has to wait for a letter telling her the date of her appointments to go get more CT scans and tests done on her head, and ultrasounds done on her stomach. These letters with appointments have always taken at least 2 or 3 months to arrive.

So it's all a huge waiting game to find out answers now. My anxiety and stress levels as well as my girlfriends have been driving me and her absolutely insane. We've both been stressing so much over all of this and I've been losing so much sleep. It's all almost unbearable. We've always found ways to relax and calm down in the past, but this is something new that we've never had to experience before in our lives, and I personally just don't know how to handle it, or what to say, or do, and I just feel absolutely hopeless and helpless.

If anyone has any advice for me, and or especially for my girlfriend on how to get through this it would be appreciated more than absolutely anything. Thank you so much.

TLDR: my girlfriend and I have serious anxiety problems. We found out last week she probably has brain cancer, or another type of cancer, and we won't know answers for a few months.

She does not recognize other's personal space. I have my own room, but I study in the attic. She will enter and then harass me for half an hour if I keep quiet (or she will try to hit me if I say anything and yell at me for a few hours). 

What I've been doing: For weeks, I try to do my work in the library or in coffee shops, but, I have to go back to the house and sleep. That is why I seclude myself in the attic when I come back. 

But, if her mood's not right, she will come up. Should I vary the places I work? I can work in the house's basement and then move back to the attic so that the effort needed for her to look for me is lower? I could stay at the coffee shop until 9, so that she won't have the energy to maybe hit me.

**Notice:** **I don't need criticism** **about the parent or me for putting up with it**. I need advice. Of course, the parent's behavior is affecting my mood, but, I already plan to distance from her when I can achieve financial independence.

I was never pressured or forced into doing well in school, but fortunately during my freshman year I realized that I love learning and have been focused and dedicated to my academics. However, I had to switch to homeschooling (and doing all my classes online) in the middle of high school. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but I hate my home and personal life. I live in my aunt and uncle's house because my mom had nowhere to go after she divorced my step-dad about five years ago. My mom is overly permissive and definitely barely passed seventh grade; she hates school and never did well in it. In addition, my aunt and uncle are protective and pretty strict. Therefore, they take out a lot of anger to my mother who relays it onto me most of the time. Furthermore, I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells every second of the day because they really don't want us here and would prefer us to move out because they're tired of my mother's bullshit. 

Everything just feels like it's overwhelming since I have to take on all these responsibilities alone, plus do well in my AP and dual enrollment classes, plus have this constant feeling like I'm a burden. 

So, I've been having an extremely hard time staying motivated to do well in my online classes because I feel too overwhelmed and frustrated most of the time. I've been getting into the habit of avoiding all of this by just taking naps when I feel like everything is too much. I can't really go out that much nor do I like to leave my room because I'd rather not deal with everyone.

This isn’t super serious, but I would really appreciate some advice right now as I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone I know about this. 

Background: I [17M] was born with a heart condition that affects blood flow, and allows oxygenated and nonoxygenated blood to mix. It’s not as serious as it sounds, but we’ve been monitoring it my whole life and because it’s a rare condition, we held off on fixing it until the medical procedures improved. Now, the procedure is relatively pretty safe, with only a 1-5% chance of any complications, so this year year, we decided to take the step and finally get surgery to fix the issue. 

That surgery was supposed to happen yesterday, but unfortunately, I caught a cold over the weekend and the doctors decided it wouldn’t be safe to go through with the operation, so it was postponed by a minimum of 6 weeks. Inconvenient, sure, but since it’s not a medical emergency there’s no physical problem with delaying things a little bit. 

The problem is my mental state: even though it’s a pretty safe procedure, it’s open heart surgery, and the recovery is pretty rough. I don’t even want to think about what will happen to me on that table. To personally become okay with undergoing the procedure, I had to make my peace with the world, and enter this headspace where I’m perfectly fine with dying. It’s probably not healthy, but it’s all I can do to keep from flinching at the sight of an IV or panicking and flailing when it’s time to take anesthesia. 

Unfortunately, though, the surgery obviously got postponed. I woke up yesterday morning with full acceptance of my (realistically unlikely) death, and I had spent the last week going through life like each thing I did would be the last time I did that thing. I was 100% prepared for the worst, and now... nothing. I still have the residue of that mindset, of making the surgery synonymous with dying, and I’m finding it really difficult to find any motivation for anything right now. I know that probably, I’ll be fine, but it’s the not knowing that’s weighing on me so heavily.  I just feel so lifeless, and it feels like my only options are to try to return to my normal state only to go through that awful decline of mentality all over again or just kind of force myself through the next few weeks with this shitty attitude. 

I’m sorry if this post comes off as “angsty teen being angsty”- I promise that for the most part, I have a pretty positive outlook on life and the world. It’s just that in this situation, it’s absolutely necessary for me to assume the unlikely worst case scenario as fact for me to have no qualms about undergoing the procedure. I’d really appreciate advice about how to inject some meaning back into my life for the next several weeks, or better ways to handle the fear of dying, or even just some feel good pick-me-up comments. Thank you.

Tl;dr: Surgery was postponed, but I already prepared myself mentally for the worst-case scenario and now I’m stuck in that headspace.

I'm not sure if my mother's behavior is normal or not. My therapist said she is influencing me with her negative thinking and that she is a bit toxic.

She often makes nasty comments about things and has a general negative attitude about things.

If I say I want to do something, she tells me that I have school and she acts like I cannot do anything else.

She makes comments about my fashion choice, how I do my make up and the type of clothes I like to buy.

I always use the money I saved up though. She calls me crazy and orders me to not wear certain things.

For example, I bought a dark denim jacket with cool prints and I am aware it a bit eccentric and I wouldn't wear it everytime, but I only managed to wear it a few times because either she hides it or she doesn't want me wear/make a scene about it.
I mean, when my grandma saw it she said it was cool and fashionable, she is ALMOST 80 YEARS OLD. 
I don't understand her attitude at all.

She calls me a psycho because of it and tonight she attacked me because I was wearing this in the house. https://kogiketsu.com/products/moonlight-koi-kimono?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=paidsocial&amp;utm_campaign=Espresso+Campaign+1+(Split+3)+Holiday&amp;utm_content=3+-+130454Ad+2--

I think it is perfect when the weather is warm or while lingering the house doing nothing but she said it was weird and started yelling at me that she didn't want me in the house if I want to dress 'like a freak'.

She says people don't like me already and if I keep 'acting like this' it will make it worse, I admit that people aren't so open minded here but it isn't that bad.

I see people wearing 'strange' things often, especially teenagers (even colored hair or tattoos).

In high school I mostly wore normal and boring clothes but it didn't help, I was still an outcast for other reasons, right now I am 18, why should I care? 

Generally I wear trendy/typical stuff though, I only have a few 'strange' pieces of clothing.

She gets angry all the time over this and she doesn't want me to wear the thing I linked above not even in the house!

I had to insist and we had an argument before she went to bed.

Today I even told her that I have a crush for a guy I met online (full post here if you want to know https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/7wqdzw/i_need_advice_because_i_am_not_sure_of_what_its/) and she said it makes no sense and started making comments about it.

At some point she said 'maybe he likes girls with big boobs' and she knows how much how much I hate my small tatas, it didn't make any sense since the guy only saw a pic of my face on fb.

She is also an extremely paranoic person and she sees bad things everywhere (she hates my therapist because she said several things she didn't like and she wants me to stop going altogether, but I know I need it).

Why does she acts this way?

This last fall I re-enrolled in college after taking a 1 year hiatus. During that year I lived with family is Central America, worked 45 hours a week and fell in love with the culture. I was happier than ever, exercising and debt free. I lost my attachment to money past being financially independent and was more at ease with life. 

The issue started because growing up I never felt like college was an option, it simply was the next step. I felt pressure to go back and get my degree. I decided to apply to some universities in order to go back and finish.

I have never liked school expect for the social aspect. My grades have always been average and I have have never put in extra effort. In high school I had plenty of friends and even when I attended my first college I had made many close friends. But being a transfer I feel like everyone already has their friends. Social circles were set and I was an outsider.

My first fall semester back was okay, but after living in the real world, school life felt so fake. Classes seem boring and pointless. I’m in many classes with kids 2-3 years younger than me and have nothing in common with many of them. Because I didn’t care for the subjects or people in the class, I stopped going to classes, put in close to no effort and stopped studying. Luckily I was still able to pull off a miracle 3.0 GPA also I felt as though I did good enough to continue.
 
My second semester started off significantly worse. I waited nearly a month to buy any books, rarely go to classes and have stopped doing much of my homework. I feel like I’m drowning because I’m beginning to fall behind. I have started to realize I don’t care about my major and see nothing in my future. I have stopped exercising, have student loans and am in debt to my parents with no current income. I feel like im falling into depression and the anxiety of my situation is making it difficult to sleep. My only friends are my roommates and I honestly don’t like them that much. 

The only thing keeping me here is the feeling that since I came back, I can’t quit again. I already left a life I loved behind and feel like I can’t go back. I don’t want to be a disappointment. My friends from high school seem to be doing so much better than I. They’re going to new places for internships, being financially independent and traveling the world. I just want to keep up. I don’t want to waste my parents energy and money nor do I want to be a disappointment but I have no idea what to do because I’m simply unhappy.

For the past year or so, I've had a pretty bad crush on a girl (call her A because I'm bad at making up fake names) and me being myself I haven't meaningfully acted on it. However, in the past couple of months, I've gotten **really** close with another girl (E). We have an amazing rapport and I've never enjoyed being around any one person more than her. As I've gotten to know E better, A kind of began to occupy less and less space in my thoughts because I was spending so much time with E.

I really think I love and care about E. She makes me warm in a way that basically no one else does. And I'm fairly confident that if I asked her out she would say yes. But I'm scared that I'm confusing our intimacy with me having feelings for her and I'm worried that by asking her out I'd risk screwing it all up. In the same vein, I'm nervous that I haven't actually gotten over A (who is now somewhat out of the picture because someone else asked her out), and I'll fall for her again once the novelty of being close with E begins to fade. If I go out with E, find that my feelings were not as strong for her as I thought in the heat of the moment, and we break up, I'll be very sad to have lost one of my 3 most important friendships and a wonderful person. I'm wary of this possibility because a VERY similar thing happened to me a couple of years ago and my current situation is uncomfortably similar to that.

\&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Part 1 TLDR: My older brother came home drunk last night and I believe will be trying to come after me.**

**Part 2 TLDR: I want to spread the word on addiction and mental health in my community**

\&amp;amp;#x200B;

Ok so lets start this. Yesterday there was some family drama between my parents and my older brother,  and I was in the middle of it.  Just to keep a long story short, my brother threw a tantrum at all of us. To provide a little background he is 24 years old and I am 20. He does have a history of having ADHD, depression, anger, and possibly bipolar based of how he was acting last night. He also does have a drinking problem, as he does have a DUI on his record. So after he throws his tantrum - which was very intense, my parents and I all collectively agree that he needs to be kicked out of the house. As he is packing his stuff, he comes back at me trying to fight me and pushes me. I get up and tell him, ""I wish you the best"". I wanted him to leave the house there, but he refused to leave and would keep coming back at me. Eventually I decide to call the cops. I'm going to paraphrase here, but basically cops show up, talk to him in the garage, talk to me and my parents in our house. The cops really can't do much, but they suggest to him that he leaves for the night, which we all wanted him to do that. But before he leaves, our parents want him to take a breathalyzer and so the cops ask him if he will take one. He refuses and leaves.

\&amp;amp;#x200B;

At exactly 2:30 in the morning I get this [text](https://imgur.com/a/4Vk17Wt) from him. About an hour later I hear someone walk through the back patio door from the basement and towards my room. Luckily my room is locked, but a loud FBI breach kind of knock is pounded upon my door. I immediately call 911. I try to grab some sort of thing that I could use to defend myself just in case he happens to enter. I make sure I place camera facing the door to capture anything that could happen. He is yelling at me through the door for about 5 minutes calling me a bitch, saying he is going to sue me for false accusations, and destroy my car. He keeps urging me to open the door, but I refuse. I would later find out through the cops that he had a BAC of about .214 and possibly on some hard drugs, like amphetamines. Once the cops show up they start off talking lightly, but he keeps pushing it, by getting into my Dad's face. He is handcuffed and taken into a police vehicle, where he is given his BAC, that he tries not to take. There isn't really anything he can be arrested for, so the cops make him call an Uber and leave our house. The cops(who were great and very professional) give us a pamphlet on a restraining order. My brother doesn't take so kindly to that. All while everything was happening, he is specifically targeting me, threatening me saying that he is going to show up at my place of work and to not go out tomorrow. After his Uber takes him away, he sends this [text](https://i.imgur.com/wwezbSo.jpg) to my mom,dad, and I in a group chat. So that is the last I heard of him. Right now I don't know exactly where he is, but I do have a little bit of fear that he may come after me. He did leave his car at our house as well. I just feel like he is too unpredictable. My Dad is handling that restraining order process, but I'm not too familiar with how that all works. I would appreciate any advice from anyone on how to go through this.

**Part 2** 

Based off the events that happened last night, I can say with 100% certainty that mental illness and addiction played a role in my older brother's behavior. I know that a situation like this can destroy a family, and it absolutely will leave a scar on ours. But I want to be able to shine some light and possibly make something good out of this. I want to be able to spread the word on mental illness and addiction in my community. I'm a big fan of boxing and so I saw the [Interview](https://youtu.be/XrM6WqYEj9Y?t=188) between Tyson Fury and Joe Rogan, where he talks about his depression and mental illness, and how he is trying to spread the word for people who might be in a similar situation. This is very inspiring to me and I feel like I can do something similar. I am in my second year of college and I live in a city of about 170,000 so it's not very big at all. A lot of people know each other around here, and some people have a big social media influence. I don't use social media much at all or have many followers, but if that is what I need to use to get the message around, then I will. 

  
I want to be able to encourage people to seek help if they have mental illness or addiction to drugs or alcohol. For anyone that suffers from mental health problems the worst thing that a person can do is take drugs and alcohol. But that is the most common approach with dealing with it. And I've seen how it can destroy families and friendships. I had a best friend from the time I was in kindergarten who ended up getting mixed up with drugs and bad friends. By the time he was 17 he had a DUI and he barely graduated high school. I want people to know that there is a blueprint and a healthier way to deal with these things. 

Most importantly I want to be able to be a role model -  that my older brother never was-  for my little brother, who is 16 and in high school. I want to encourage him and the people his age not to go around and get caught up thinking that they need to be doing what everyone else is doing. Because we live in a culture that is glamorizes partying, drinking, and drugs that young people will see all over social media. I don't believe that is a healthy way to live. I want to encourage these young kids and people of all ages to become leaders and people that leave a good example. And I also want to learn alongside them. So I would also appreciate any advice on how to approach this goal that I have. 

If you made it to the end of this post I thank you very much for taking the time to read this. I have faith that I can do everything in my power to make some sort of difference.

I started dating this guy about a year ago. He is genuinely the most incredible person I've ever met - supportive, caring, funny, smart, all around a wonderful person. At least, I think so. 

My friends on the other hand, cannot stand him. They think he's rude because he doesn't say hello when he comes over, I spend too much time with him (granted we spend a lot of time together, but it's not like I don't see/make time for my friends), he disrespects their culture (because he listens to rap music and wears a gold chain? If someone could explain this to me, that would be great), and they just generally don't like him. They've never straight up admitted that they don't, but they have made it clear that he is not someone they would choose to associate with. 

They've talked to me multiple times about how I put my relationship before them and the things I have done wrong since we have started dating - not answering texts as often as I used to, always being out with him, etc. I've apologized and worked on it, but every month or so they're upset about something else I'm doing in regards to him. I try and fix it, but it's hard feeling like I have to walk on eggshells to make sure they're happy with the way I'm running my relationship (and life). I avoid talking about him with them, so I don't give them any reason to critique our relationship (I understand friends are supposed to point out when something is wrong, but he's genuinely a good boyfriend - I wouldn't hide abusive behavior if that EVER became an issue, but I avoid mentioning when he didn't pick me up until 15 minutes after we planned because it would result in a ""he doesn't respect your time"" conversation...does that make sense?)

My boyfriend doesn't try much to get along with them, either. When we first started dating, he overheard them saying some not-so-nice things about me and our relationship. At the time he told me, I never confronted them about it because I was worried they wouldn't have owned up to it and it would have turned into a ""you believe him over us, your friends for 3 years."" I figured it would just blow over and all of them would just be civil around each other if the relationship continued - I was wrong. It seems wrong to bring it up now, considering I've known this is why he hasn't liked them the entirety of our relationship.

The only times all of us have hung out, it's been awkward and uncomfortable for everyone. Either my friends and I are talking and he's left out or my friends are talking to each other, I'm talking to my boyfriend, and no conversations are intertwined. My friends have expressed to me that they don't like the tension and don't know where it stems from (they don't know he overheard them talking junk, he was outside their bedroom waiting for me). I dealt with it for the past year, but now my friends and I will be roommates and I cannot deal with getting dirty looks whenever I say he's coming over or that I'm going out on a date. It's exhausting. They know he's not going anywhere and he knows they're not, either.

I've talked to my mom about it and she says my friends find reasons to not like him because he takes time that used to be solely ""reserved"" for them, which results in them spending less time with me. Granted, it's true, but I'm so much happier now. I still make time for them and we still see each other (almost) everyday. 

They don't want to talk about it all together either. Each of them knows the other doesn't like them. My boyfriend knows why my friends aren't fond of him, my friends don't know why he doesn't like them (pretty sure they think it's a race thing, which isn't the case - he just doesn't like people talking behind others backs). 

I have introduced my boyfriend to many other friends and almost all my family, so I know it's not that he's a bad person and I'm just ""blinded"" by love. I've told the situation to other friends outside our circle (besides the part about him hearing them talk junk) and they say they're just jealous or need to get a grip on reality because he is not doing anything wrong - you do not *need* to say hi to someone if they don't say hi first (even in their own home), he isn't rude when they're around (just doesn't talk to them), and he makes me happy. I'm not talking bad about him to them or them to him, so there's no reason I should feel so ""in the middle.""  

I guess the advice I'm looking for isn't so much ""what advice can you give me to fix this"" (because I don't think anything will fix it) but more so, ""what advice can you give me to cope with the situation?"" I've told them I don't want to be put in the middle and not to talk about each other to me (since I'm just going to stick up for the person who isn't there), but it still comes up way too often for me. I don't know how I'm going to deal with living with my friends when I want my boyfriend to come over 3-4 nights a week (I can't sleep at his place because I have my dog and his unit isn't pet friendly). Any help/advice would be appreciated because I'm drowning right now.

Although I always liked to design and enjoyed drawing and sketching, so I also considered studying **Industrial Design** but my parents, my teachers and everyone around me told me that it was hard to get a good paying job or even a job with that degree in my country so it was pretty much useless.

So my father is a piece is Shit and my mother doesn’t seem to care...

Backstory-

Summer 2010- I was on my dads computer and found his accounts to dating sites and messages between him and other woman 

October 2010- I found messages on his phone between him and another woman 

~sometime during spring 2011~ my mom become suspicious and I finally told her what I had found, she confronted my dad and he made up excuses and lies. She believed him. 

March 2012- my mental health has reached rock bottom and I spent two weeks in a mental hospital for attempted suicide and eating disorder (I was 100lbs and my dad called me fat, we didn’t have a good relationship) I didn’t tell anyone the real reason behind it all...

2015- I became very suspicious again and gave into curiosity and started going through my dads phone and ipad. He had gotten a separate phone from his company supplied business one because he believed they were tracking him and listening in on his calls or some crap. My findings over the next two years- accounts for sites for essentially rich old men, Craigslist, back page, you name it. Nude pictures of woman. Conversations with woman thanking him for paying their mortgages and other things. Appointments at special ‘massage parlours’ (complete with a recording of his experience). Proof of a full on relationship with another woman who f*cking had cancer,and lived in the city where he constantly was for work, and proof that he had spent around $20,000 on her various expenses.  

2017- My mother got suspicious again and I finally came clean to her. I showed her pictures I had taken of my findings on his devices. She was utterly devastated. I will never forget the look on her face that night.... when he came home that night she confronted him with all the evidence I had given her. He didn’t say anything, he just cried. 

About 10 days later he moved out of the house and into an apartment. 

Now here’s where the real f-d up crap starts to happen. 

My mother kept in contact with him. He’d come to the house to come and walk the dog and they would talk. They agreed he would start seeing a councillor and then they would go to one together to see if they could work it out. My mother told me she would give it a year to see if it could be fixed or not. The one year was up June 2018, she decided that she needed another year. Since my fathers funds were no longer tied up in his extra curricular activities he finally put the money into renovating our kitchen and bathrooms (he’s always been the type to think that money can buy love, ha). He and my mom started going on ‘dates’ again and were starting to spend quite a bit of time together again and were going to couples counselling, as well as their own individual councillors.   

Now I should note from the night I told my mom about what a monster he was I have refused to speak to him. He paid for my mom and I to go the Jamaica for her birthday and she forced me to write him a thank you card. I’ve also had to write a thank you card for him giving me $3000 at Christmas. My older brother has kept in contact with him, even though it’s strained he feels obligated to since dad has paid for his 10years of university and expenses. 

My brother is going to France for three months as part of a university research exchange. My mom is going to go visit him and the original plan was for her to go with my brothers girlfriends mom. That’s changed. My mom is about to go (nothings been booked yet)  to France with her piece of Shit husband and I believe that means there going to get back together and he’ll move back into the house in June. 

I can’t even begin to describe how much this devastates me. My mom and I are super close and I honestly love her more than anything in the world. But I don’t love her enough to be able to support her decision to get back together with him. This man ruined my life. The mental f*cked up-ness he has caused me is out of this world, and my mom knows this. If they get back together my relationship with my mom will never be even close to the same again. For starters I can’t even begin to imagine the toll this is going to take on my mental health... and I will never go back to my mothers house, my home, ever again as long as that man is there. 

I have no idea why my mom has even gave him a second thought from day one, but I believe the thought of loneliness scares her... even though before she ever found out about his wrong doings their marriage really wasn’t the best. He always has, and even to this day, belittles her and talks down to her like she’s a stupid child. My mom has started to stand up for her self a bit in the past year but over all still doesn’t really have much of a back bone to him or the situation at all. 

I go back home in two weeks and it is pretty much my last shot to essentially make my mother choose between me and him.... 

So internet strangers, what do you think I should do....
Has anyone been in a similar situation?

My dad tends to bulldoze his opinions and lacks empathy. He ignores my opinion quite a bit. He didn’t believe I truly suffered from OCD, until he saw that I couldn’t do a life saving thing. He always tells me to get Facebook, when I’ve said I do not benefit from it. Just writing this is pissing me off, but whatever. He has good intentions, but he cannot see beyond his own opinion.

So I went to the doctor today because I've been having some problems with my appetite. Out of nowhere food just doesn't really seem good. Like I know my body needs to eat but once I start eating something I just feel sick. I don't know what's up but I thought I should go get it checked out. 

I am in her office and she comes in and I start telling her what's going on. She proceeds to ask me questions on whether I'm allergic to any medications, if I use any tobacco products, if I drink and if I use marijuana. I tell her I'm not allergic, I don't use any sort of tobacco, Ive never been a fan of drinking but I do smoke marijuana. Being from Texas it is illegal but she is my doctor so I wanted to be honest with her. I am 22 years old, I go to school full time and I'm also a manager at a local restaurant so I don't really have time to smoke all day. It's also kind of a bigger risk than what it's worth so I don't go too crazy with it. I'm also a really anxious person. Like I just always feel on edge so it's good for me after a long day. My dad takes all sorts of medication for his anxiety and depression issues but I just couldn't see myself using antidepressants unless I desperately need them.

I told her, ""I don't use it all the time. I am honestly a really busy person so I don't have time to really sit around and smoke all day."" 
She looks at me and replies with, ""yeah not yet I guess."" 
I was pretty alarmed by what she said so I told her that I personally know a lot of people who use marijuana for more than just to sit around and do nothing. Of course there are people who smoke weed all day and sit around and bum but there also are a lot of people like myself who just use it as something to let off stress at the end of a day. 
She just kind of laughs and turns away from me. She then asks me more questions on my eating habits on whether I eat breakfast or not, which I don't. I wake up at around 9 and go to class until 10 when I go to work and I'll eat food there when I get off. We talk a little more and she recommends this Ensure drink and also to 'cut out all extra activities that aren't beneficial to your health'. 
This is when I start to get a little agitated. I explain that I wouldn't have even said anything if she hadn't have been my doctor and I had thought she could assess my situation better. I told her that I'm an anxious person and to even tell her that I used it in the first place was uncomfortable for me. I don't want to be labeled as a 'stoner' or a 'pothead' so I don't like going around telling everyone how often I use it. As I'm telling her all of this stuff my hands literally start sweating and my leg starts shaking. At this point all I can think of is uncomfortable this is that I'm even having this argument with my doctor, of all people.
I can tell she's getting defensive because I'm not just agreeing with what she's telling me and she says that I don't have a 'sense of reality' out of nowhere. I didn't know what she meant by it because it was so random. She just replied and said, ""you're coming here to me to find out what is wrong and you're getting offended when I tell you what my opinion is on it."" 
I honestly was about to have a panic attack in there because I'm not going to have a full blown argument with my doctor in her office. So I just tell her okay and ask her where I need to go to get my blood work done.

so I have my Venmo on my tinder profile. It started as a joke but people did actually start sending me money. Anyhow, three months ago this one random dude I never matched with sent me $100. I never heard anything from him again. 

Yesterday he came back. He started sending me increments of $300 and gave me his phone number. A total of $1500 he sent me that one day. I texted him (which I’m starting to regret) to ask him why. He said he just likes to see people’s reactions. 

The conversation was just me telling him thanks numerous times. He then asked what I was doing over the weekend, but I told him I was busy. End of story, end of conversation.  Haven’t heard from him. 

Now, as happy as I am for getting the money- I am very scared because my friends pointed out different theories- that he could be a human trafficker, or a crazy stalker that’s getting my info somehow, etc etc... what do you guys think? If y’all think this is creepy as I do, do y’all have any preventative methods to secure my information and privacy??? I did text him and so now he has my phone number.

I’ve had the mandatory DSS training training that includes determining signs of sexual abuse in young children, as well as college courses that address the topic. 

I had a student (she was recently moved to the next class up) who is very much special needs (likely Down syndrome and a sensory disorder in one), but her parents seemingly aren’t taking steps to help her. While in my class, she would often touch herself and hump her cot to completion during nap time, and if this behavior was stopped she became irrationally upset. When changing her diaper, I and my assistant teacher noticed that her privates were often very red, to the point that at first glance she looked to be bleeding, and she was *gaping*. She never attempted to mess with any of the other children outside of kissing on the lips, but that kind of behavior is pretty typical of a two year old. 

Her family situation isn’t the best. Her family are Chinese immigrants, and she has a twin brother who is very clearly cared for more than she is (new clothes, always put together, wears an expensive golden chain, etc.) Her mother definitely seems to have some sort of mental disability herself, but not something severe. Her father doesn’t speak to teachers often,  but when he spoke to me he often tried to intimidate me. 

As a mandatory reporter, I brought my concerns to the administration and they told me to write out what I have witnessed in a non-biased way and they will send it along the proper channels. 

It’s been four months and nothing has come of it. I honestly believe they never contacted anyone about it, and when I ask them about it I never get clear answers. 

Her current teacher was telling me that the girl has recently begun smearing her feces on the walls (and tried to put in on her teacher) when she uses the bathroom. I know this too is a common sign of sexual abuse, and let her know my concerns and the steps I’ve taken. She said she will document any behavior she finds to be out of the ordinary from here on out. 

After finding out that the girl is showing more signs of abuse, I’m beyond irritated that nothing was done. My last day at the school is Tuesday, but a big part of me still wants to say something for the sake of the child. 

What should I do? I know that I could just call CPS/DSS myself, but I don’t want to be seen as a disgruntled former employee or an overly sensitive one.

Just know I had a sad depressing thought, it isn't the first time it's probably the 3rd or 4th. Well. Let's start. I'm 19, freshman in college and I just thought about my family and the future. I'm not in a relationship right now, so idk if it was anything to do with it but I don't think so.

Anyway, when I have this thought it always makes me cry or really depressed for that moment. What is it? Well, time. Once in a while I think about time and life, how I'm afraid of the time going on. My parent's are in their late 50's I have 3 siblings in over their 30's. And I'm afraid idk I just think to myself how 10 years from now things could change and by change I mean my parent's could be gone, my siblings will grow older, and that scares me. I don't want time to keep going anymore, I don't want to remember how life was today or before. Right now I'd wish I was still a kid I would go back to being a 9 year old brat where I would be with my family. And tbh I'm not really a crybaby I rarely cry or take anything bad seriously. Getting hurt, bulling or dumb stuff like that was never an issue. 
 
When I was 10, 9 years ago, my brother was killed, my mom was devastated, I was clueless at the time, but when I saw it with my own eyes I cried for the first time and never did again until recently. My brother was 20 when he died. I honestly wished he was alive instead of me. He was rebelish, a deliquent, and violent, but after he got out of juvie he began taking life seriously, he changed, he just needed a couple more years before he could come back home since he was deported for a couple of years. Back to the main thing.

I miss him, I miss the time when I was young, when I didn't think about life seriously, honestly being who I am I see myself as a waste of air, my life has been the best, honestly if someone else lived in my shoes they would say wow your life is fucked up. But I don't mind, I got tired of thinking to myself why is life bad for me, why did I get nothing, but I didn't get nothing, how I saw life back then was that, some people should at least get a couple things right. Other people I know got, A caring family, good health, money, education, intelligence,. Etc. Then I saw me, I got a family, that's it. I thought to myself, howcome that's all I got. He got a caring family and they are rich cause there parents studied, or they complain about how they got a 96 instead of a 97 in an assignment.  They get to fuck around drink smoke weed a bunch of different shit. I didn't but know I don't care I'm glad I didn't cause I'd probably be ungrateful like them.

Good things happen to bad people, meanwhile good people just get nothing or get worse. I hate how our generation has become, teens cutting themselves or hurting themselves cause they get bullied over dumb shit, kids shooting schools cause they don't think rationally, kids getting spoiled, I mean who buys a 10 years old and iPhone 9. I barely got an LG in highschool. I see my life and I see how different it is. I envy people but I rarely do. I keep it to myself and don't care, until one night I have the thought about life and envy. My life isn't great, it isn't simple, it isn't even a fair life. But I don't mind it. Life is unfair so just deal with it right?

I got a family, I enjoy spending time with them, but RN everything's changed, they are growing old, I'm growing old. And the thought of how one day I won't longer spend time with them breaks my heart I wish that I could stop time, not how it sounds, but I want to live and everyone to live in a parallel universe where we don't grow old, where we are immortal. I don't want to see anyone die. I don't want to be alone. Being the youngest of the family. Scares me. I'm the last one to go. But I don't want anyone to go. I want to die already so I don't have to live anymore knowing that my  family and me will no longer be together smiling.

I'm sorry if you had to read this, idk if I need advice or anything, I just wanted to share this story, I'm currently upset at life of how time goes on and we grow old, 

If you have any thoughts or opinions of what I should do, or how I should see things, or just what you think about this please go ahead lmk. 

You know I know this is serious, but don't forget to

Any attempt at communicating and encouraging to find a better job ends up in him shutting me down completely.


The biggest issue right now is this stupid job.  Greg has two great degrees, graduated with high marks and was overall successful in his college run.  Problem is, he is a lazy m$#@f*cker.  Growing up his Dad did everything for him, clean, cook, do his homework...including writing Greg's resume and finding him jobs when he lived at home (1 hour away from where we live together now).  Speed up to almost 2 years ago when Greg graduated, he didn't start looking for employment until he began running out of money.  At that point he was desperate yet... never left the house to give out a resume?? I was supportive and tried to help by driving him if he wanted yet he never took up the offer.  To sum up, he wound up finding a minimum wage retail job.  The past year he has put his all into it and just 3 months ago was promoted to supervisor.  The first 6 months he liked his job, as all new retailers do and then quickly found out some of the terrors that can lurk in the long run at a poorly run store (aka customers and shitty coworkers).


Problem is now, he hates supervising.  For all too understanding reasons, the people he works with are not the brightest, he finds himself overworked, cannot find time to do his hobby (gym) and gets frustrated with his friends (and me) when we plan things on the weekend when he is scheduled to work and can't join. On top of this, management STILL hasn't changed his pay to a supervisory roll (apparently he's getting it this week three months late).


What I need advice on is kind of in the aftermath but is still important.  Today I had enough.  I picked up Greg from work and not surprisingly, for the nth time in the past year he starts complaining about how terrible his day was.  I am in exams and it is taking a toll on me.  I can't stand listen to him suffering, it hurts me to know he's in a bad situation but angers me BECAUSE HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  He makes up excuses that he uses his days off to relax and doesn't want to spend them looking for other jobs yet is miserable.

I love him and want the best for him but I can't stand him complaining to me like this anymore when he won't do anything about it.  I told him this and he told me in a sarcastic tone ""Well it sucks that yooooou are suffering from my suffering. Poor you for having to hear about my day."" Obviously that didn't go over well.  I told him, yes I was suffering as a consequence of his shitty job and that he needed to quit it and find something better.  We drove in silence the rest of the night home.

Anyways, I am in the middle of exams and was too frustrated to deal with that, so I dropped him off at home and went back to the library.  Any advice would be great on how to approach this aftermath when I get home would be great.

TLDR: Super educated boyfriend works in a shitty retail job and complains about it all the time yet is too lazy to apply for anything legitimate.

When I call and ask why I was declined, I found out this is due to my hours and tight schedule. Where I live, the economy isnt well and most places only want employees with more free schedules.  I can't change my classes and they are until June.

A friend reccomended being a sugar baby. But I'm not sure if I can go through with it. I recently got out of a long term relationship and can't fathom being with anyone else right now, and that includes a sugar daddy. The only way it could work would be if it was non sexual (and most likely online). Even with the non sexual idea though, I'm afraid it will impact my future romantic relationships once I tell them I used to be a sugar baby. This is my biggest worry. I don't want something like this to cause potential partners to leave. 

I realize that's my best shot at getting a good sum of money, besides a job, however. 

My parents are currently on a budget which includes cutting out allowance. This happened recently, and during which we also moved and thus had to quit my old job. They originally told me that they would pay for these fees because my job is gone but today I was informed they will not any longer. 

I'm honestly freaking out quite a bit. Things like selling weed and asking friends for money are off the table completely because I'm not comfortable with that. 

Please give any input and thank you in advance.

So I have known this girl for 1 1/2 years, and have had a thing for her, for most of it. She has had a boyfriend for most of that time and became single about a month ago. Anyways, Imma start from the beginning.

We started at a retail job, around the same time, and yeah. We chatted and talked a lot, and kinda knew each other before we started the job. \(we started 1 1/2 years as of this post\), but knew each other before that. Anyways, I grew to like her more and more. Saw her Boyfriend come by work and it kinda hurt to see them together. They fought and broke up a couple of times, and she got immensly distraught over it. And it hurt me even more to see her like that. I was always there to give her a shoulder to cry on, always there to talk to her and stuff.

Anyways, about a month ago, they broke up. and I Was there, did my best to cheer her up and make her happy. And then after a couple of weeks, Against the suggestion of my other friend, I told her how I felt. And it kinda made things awkward. 

Anyways, fast forward through a month of awkwardness. I get a new job, put my two weeks in at the job with her. ANd started my new job at a different store. Last night, I dropped by the store where I used to work at and she was working. I was there to grab a drink, and a spoon for my cake. Ended up chatting and catching up with her. She wanted some of the cake so I let her have some. She then offered to give me a ride home. And While sitting in her car outside my apartment, we were talking, and made plans to go see the new Avengers Movie next week. Now I am incredibly nervous because of how I feel about her and just don't know what to do.

I am 22 years old, a fresh graduate with a Finance degree from an Australian University. I just graduated in July this year, and right now I am pondering my future. I am faced with a very difficult decision.
Basically, I completed my Finance degree with mediocre grades (just barely enough to pass every subject), because I had ZERO interest in Finance and only studied this degree because my parents advised me to do so (I'm Asian, surprise surprise). I understand that it is also partly my responsibility that I did not bring up my disliking of Finance to my parents, but all has been said and done now.
Basically, I am considering becoming a Doctor. I have always been interested in the medical field, and have always been fascinated by the idea of being a Neurosurgeon. However, given my poor results in uni, the only chance I have of doing this would be to start from scratch. I.e. Take a Pre-University course (e.g. A-levels/AUSMAT/etc.) and enroll in uni to do a Undergraduate Medicine degree. Is this a ridiculous idea?

Last year in around december, I met this girl that I really liked. I live in a small town in which basically everyone is very pretentious, and judgy. She wasn’t, and had the same sense of humor that I did, and we shared many likes and dislikes.  This girl (who I’ll call H) and I talked for months, however I began carrying the conversations, and we stopped talking. 




For some reason, everyone in my grade acts like a 7 year old when they learn someone likes someone; they act very awkward, and make it a bigger deal than it is. Anyway, I told one of my best friends that I liked h. Let’s call him Q. I now know that he can’t keep a secret, and he told people. I was in a class in which I sat with another friend, who I’ll call A, Q, and the girl I liked. A went, “hey, you know OP likes you, right?”.



(A apologized and told me how much of an ass he felt he had been. I let it slide).





I thought that the girl I liked knew, bc my friends had been teasing me about it. I had stopped talking to her, and was planning to start talking to her a few weeks later so it wouldn’t be awkward. However, this was excruciatingly painful. I haven’t talked to her since. 




Q talked to H a little bit during the months we were on speaking terms. He said she clearly liked me, which is what I know. However, my anxiety tells me that she never did, (even with all the signs), and she was just talking to me bc she felt bad for me. 




Sorry if it’s confusing, and if it’s not as in depth or as meaningful as most of the other posts on here. Even though we haven’t talked for months, I still like H.

I threw small rocks on our window and knocked and rang on the door, but the door is too far away from our bed.

For some reason, I feel like I am absolutely powerless when it comes to my food habits / eating. I'm 5 foot tall and I went from 105 to 120lb, I gained 15 lb my freshman year (classic i know ) and now I'm a junior and still haven't been able to lose the weight. I was really skinny my whole life and able to eat a diet consisting mainly of chocolate, cereals and pizza and never gained a pound. Today those unhealthy eating habits have finally caught up with me at 20 years old. I now have really high cholesterol, and I barely get my period anymore due to my unhealthy lifestyle (I have PCOS). I know and have been told by my doctors numerous times that it would help me get my period back tremendously if I just ate healthier and worked out. I'm definitely not overweight but I feel as though my body is used to being skinnier than I am now. Everywhere I go I feel like people are judging how fat I am, or I feel like my friends are probably judging me for how much weight I've gained. I went from being someone who didn't even think about food at all other than when she was hungry to someone who obsessively thinks about food at all hours of the day and as a result I just eat much more. I try all these fad diets but give up after a few days because they're too hard and then just end up stuffing my face with food. Even when I try just counting calories I give up within 3 or 4 days and I really just don't know why. Since I'm really short and fairly small all the calorie calculators online tell me to eat less than 1000 calories a day if I would want to lose 2 lb a week. I just feel disgusting and self conscious and I just wish I could be skinny again just so I could feel normal again. I feel like I'm stuck in this body right now that I don't even recognize, like this body isn't me. I'm generally a pretty confident person but when it comes to my weight I'm just totally ashamed. I know I'm not that heavy, so please don't reply that I should be okay with my weight because I'm just not. I want to go back to being how I was and I just can't stop eating shit. So I just really wanted to know if theres anyone out there that was in a similar situation and has brought themselves to lose weight and how? I enjoy working out, but I just can't stop eating corn flakes and bread for the life of me.

We both really liked memes of the edgy variety. We had a lot in common. We’d often text each other all day and send memes all the time. We’d even play roblox “ironically” together. I really liked her except she’s super awkward. I thought maybe she also liked me but we never talked about that because I felt it would be weird. After a few weeks we stop talking. But I never really got over her.

August I met my girlfriend, E. She was in my class and we started talking a lot. She has excellent music taste and she’s super kind and understanding. I’m never embarrassed to tell her my secrets and desires. I feel as if I could really be myself around her. She’s so kind I really do love her. We’ve been together four months and we spent Valentine’s Day together.

But I’ll tell you how this happened. Valentine’s Day is also my best friend’s birthday. E couldn’t get a ride home in time so she tagged along for my best friend’s birthday party. I didn’t want her to come though, because it she would be awkward and not speak to anyone, and I didn’t want her to feel awkward. So I asked her to get a ride. I didn’t notice it but this was a dick move. She said her brother was coming and she was going to walk towards the street. I was too dumb to notice that what I was doing was very shitty.

The party started and my friends pointed out how I was a penis. So I called but E said she was on call. I know it was her friend. I’m not the jealous type and I know what she was trying to do so I just decided to have fun. But I kept thinking about how I fucked her over... and how H was there too. E knew that an old crush of mine would be there. You see it wasn’t much of a party, but more of a get together. H and my best friend have been friends for years so she was there. I talked to her for the first time in a while and I realized I never really got over her. But my mind often switched from E to H.

H offered me a ride home so I went with her. After I finally got home I decided I’ll just forget H. But she texts me ten minutes later that she wants to talk to me like we used to. I foolishly agreed even though I have a girlfriend. I ended up confessing that I like her. And she confessed that she likes me back. But she knows I have a gf.

Idk what to do rn. I love E a lot. But I really fucking like H. They’re both amazing girls. I can’t stop thinking about it. I can’t seem to forget about H. She’s so cool and unique. But E is an amazing girlfriend. I feel so terrible and I really can’t decide. Should I tell E? Should I cut off all contact with H? Should I just not be in a relationship?

I know what I want to say in my head, but when it comes to actually writing it down it's always a bit awkward and disjointed. Sorry for rambling too.

Basically, I'm 17, male and gay. Most of my female friends know, but hardly anyone else. I had never thought about relationships until last year when I had an 'encounter' with one of my friends at the time. It went just about as bad as it could do and is now just an awkward memory (we're still friends though, somehow).

Anyway, one of my other friends, let's call him Mortimer (idk why), is in my opinion, very attractive. I didn't always think that he was, but after a bit of rebounding and time I started to develop feelings for him. Mortimer is a bit of a lad, but he's also quite gentle and sensitive (??). Since Mortimer is laddy, he tends to be a bit flirty with me in a jokey way. I've never seen him act like it with other people that much, but I reciprocate the flirtiness a lot more than everyone else, and this backwards and forwards 'flanter' has somehow ended up in me leading myself on.

It gets to the point where I'll be nervous to open a message on Snapchat, and might even wait a minute to open it so it doesn't look like I'm desperate (I am a bit though). Now, to my knowledge Mortimer is straight, but he's never had a girlfriend and the flirting makes me think otherwise. It's like my brain is just in two completely separate parts. 1 half (the realistic one) is saying ""He's straight, you're going to be alone forever, suck it up"", and the other half is telling me that i have a chance.

It's got to a point where I'm starting to get really frustrated at myself because I always end up being sad when I think about it realistically. I still want to be friends with Mortimer because he is genuinely a nice person, but I don't know how to get over my feelings for him.

Also, bit of a double whammy, how would I even go about finding people who could potentially like me back? I feel like there aren't any other gay people at my school and that I'll just be alone forever :)

Pretty much everything has been accessible via public transportation--college, grocery shopping, work, ect; however, I am starting to feel extremely confined by my lack of driving ability. I don't plan on buying a car because car insurance costs in Boston are astronomical, but I do want to get my license so that I at least have the option of driving. 

The older I get, the more the concept of driving intimidates me. I'm honestly terrified beyond imagine. I've grown up around Boston drivers and Boston road rage, so the notion of being on the road gives me so much anxiety. I just barely passed my learner's permit exam and I'm not at all confident in my knowledge (or lack thereof) of road rules.

I feel so embarrassed that I still haven't learned how to drive. I know I'm not the only one in this situation; many of my peers (also from Boston) learned how to drive at an older age due to lack of incentive and money.

I'm a 17 year old who's currently studying in Spain for 10 months (have been here 2, will be here 8 more). However I'm having some issues with my host family and I'm not entirely sure how to deal with them.

1. My family doesn't really do anything as a 'family' - the parents are divorced and live separately and my siblings are quite independent so I've been spending most of my time on my own. I've asked to do activities before but plans always seem to fall through. Should I just keep asking more? I don't want to put them in a bad financial situation or pressure them. Or should I take it to my local coordinator instead? I feel really jealous of the other students whose families take them on vacation with them and I don't want to spend all my time here alone.

2. How do I deal with being alone so much of the time? My older sister and my mum stay a lot of nights at their respective boyfriend's houses and so we often don't eat meals together and it's getting pretty lonely. Is there any way I can ask them to spend more time here or to eat meals together without seeming rude? Also I've missed out once on a field trip by not having my host mother be able to sign off on it, as she wasn't at home and I didn't see her for a couple of days. I'd like to avoid this in the future. 

3. My younger host sister is also acting strangely. Wearing my clothes without asking as well as taking some of my other things like my lighter and then denying it, passive-aggressively encouraging me to leave the house whenever she has friends over, not talking to me apart from when she needs help with homework, amongst some other incidents. I initially chalked it up to just being 15 and weird but it's rather alienating. I want her to understand that I'm a member of the family now and I wish she'd include me. However she has a short temper and I'm worried about how I can phrase it right. 

Sorry for all the questions. Any shred of advice would be greatly appreciated. (Also, although I'm not entirely happy with my situation, I don't want to change families cause I've already changed families from one that really wasn't working and I've settled in at this point.)

Me and my partner have been with each other through everything, dated for 4 years through highschool and eventually initiated an open relationship out of a couple dramas we had in the past, 

5 years after high school, weve now experienced life to a point of gaining our independence and creating a wonderful life.

She is always honest with me, except for one moment she lied to me about having feelings for someone else who was a very close friend, I told her I wasnt really comfortable with this because I thought in our open relationship our bounderies were set that wed both accept each others partners before going forward.

So I decided fuck it, I love her, and my friend is a good person, but it never sat with me right, to the point of our three way relationship feeling stressed. All of us getting mad and either one of us always feeling as if one of us is getting less attention or affection. Also we could never all 3 be physically comfortable although we tried, it never got somewhere really enjoyable, more or less awkward.

Now here's where it gets tricky, that friend is a key component to something weve all Been working on, and he lives with us. because of the tensions felt, she wants a break from anything seriously physical ie, sex, or kissing with specifically me, so that she can make a worthy bond with him and be faithful. She keeps saying it's only for the time being. She doesnt do anything with him while I'm around to so shes not vindictive or rude,

She shows me affection here and there, and says what we have is still important, and when I talk to other people or get seriously involved, (all be it only one person I was seriously involved with recently) she gets very upset to a point of getting mad with someone I met.

I love her, but I'm so confused, I want to be with her but i can only see her as a friend in a sense at the moment?, I've slept with her in the same bed for like 6 years, and gone through life changing and threatening situations, were still best friends but, I always feel anxious now, will this be the moment she accepts me back in? Or is this just a good moment were having? And the thoughts that i get when shes with other people is horrible, and i dont find it at all satisfying or seductive. I have no idea what to do, I tend to just try to make her happy, but I feel like I'm losing it...

The one I have is most likely unhealthy, and feels quite unescapable. Without any further ado, let's get on with this.

When I was a young boy, I was happy-go-lucky like most kids. My Dad's family made me really religious back then, and I hadn't a care in the world. Ever since I was little I always questioned the existence of humans, but it all didn't matter, I thought God made humans or something. When I got older I began to realize how much I didn't fit in with the other kids, I never understood why, but when I was around age 12 I found out the whole time I had ADHD (predominant inattentive). The older I got the more I contemplated, and eventually when I was around 13, I decided I was an Atheist, I found the possibility of a God creating all of existence was not possible (that's just me personally). Lately I realized that everything we do is ultimately pointless, we suffer, we rejoice, we die. The solar system, galaxy, and even the universe shall come to an end too. I have no friends, am recovering from social anxiety, I don't fit in, and I can't feel happiness anymore. I'd say no one outside my family gives a damn about me, but even some of my family members just decided they don't like me. I'm lazy, useless, and good for nothing. I don't work hard, and sure you could say I could contribute to science when I get older, but I can't even focus in school without the damn medication, the very thing that gives me extreme mood swings and amped up my anxiety. The only reason I live is because my mom wouldn't know what to do if I died. But to be honest, if all she had to worry about was my sister, her life would be a lot easier. I see the beautiful things in life, and I struggle to see the day that might flip my whole life around. But I am lonely, no one spends time with me. I want to be with people, but I can't even fit in. I can't last much longer if no one cares about me. Anyways, thanks if you read all this mess. And one last thing.

I’ll just call them Sarah and Carly. I wasn’t really friends with either of them until this school year when I started hanging out with their friend group. It’s a group of 6 girls and me and we are all sophomores in high school. At the beginning of the year none of them really did anything illegal or risky, but this year most of them started trying out stuff like vaping and drinking. I had already done those things so I didn’t think much of it. All of us in the group are ok with occasionally getting high or drunk as long as we’re being safe and careful. I know weed and alcohol are bad for teenagers but infrequent, safe use doesn’t have a bad impact from my experiences. Sarah and Carly are not very smart and a little boy crazy, so they don’t realize how dangerous these things can be. 

Over the past 5 weeks they have been going downhill FAST because they started spending time with this girl named Megan. Megan vapes at school, does lots of drugs, and steals shit from stores all the time. S &amp; C have been posting stories getting drunk with her almost every weekend, and they went to the mall with her and stole lots of clothes. Over spring break they got drunk 6 times in a week. They also started spending time with these senior boys, and I think they are influencing them too.

The rest of the group was talking and we were really worried about them, but also angry because they basically abandoned us for Megan. One of us tried to reach out to Carly by sending a text about how worried she was, but Carly kinda brushed it off. 

We were going to just let them do their thing and hope they learn from their mistakes but after what I heard today I feel like I should do something. Sarah was drunk at a party a few days ago and she woke up to some guy fingering her. She told us in class and we asked if it was consensual she said “I didn’t say no.” What she way saying made it seem fine to her but I could just see the guilt and sadness in her eyes. We also found out they stole stuff again and one of them got caught by the employees, even though they all had stuff and could have gotten in huge trouble.

I honestly don’t know what to do. From what I’ve said they probably seem like horrible people, but they used to be super nice girls. They are just too stupid too see the difference between having fun while you’re young and ruining your life. Taking to them wouldn’t really work because I’m not super close with them and I’m a guy. I’ve thought about contacting their parents but Sarah has lots of family issues so I could end up making things worse.

It sucks but that's life.

Anyways, I got dumped by my ex about 2 and a half months ago. She was still in high school and I was experiencing my first year in college. When she broke up with me, she basically said it was because she didnt want to do long distance, she had lost her feelings for me, and other reasons I guess (I don't think she said everything but knowing everything wouldn't help at all). When she dumped me, I wouldn't deny we had a problem or two, but I was still very invested in trying to make the relationship work because I cared about it.

Over the course of the past 2.5 months, its just been getting harder for me to cope with our split. In that time, I kept intermittently texting her as a friend, only to realize about a month ago that I was being semi toxic towards her in the way I tried to joke about things. While at college, my friends were enough to keep me distracted for most of the day, but now Im home for the summer and none of them live nearby. I lack transportation and friends to go out and do anything at the moment. A large part of me still misses her and Im struggling to deal with that along with the guilt I have had for being semi toxic. I qant to apologize, but at the same time I dont know if its because of the guilt I hold or the feelings that still remain. 

I need help in finding something to do to keep my mind busy, as my job isnt engaging enough and I have little chance of doing things with other friends. Im also not sure if I should apologize or not.

After Uni I moved back home (Small town 3000 people, It's actually where the Foot and Mouth disease crisis started you can probably guess where it is with that clue.) in 2014 and was working part-time in a craft shop this was only meant to be temporary but I couldn't get a full-time job so basically couldn't save money to do a masters or move out or to do anything of value.

I've had 5 jobs since moving home Craft Shop,Mountain Warehouse (Quit after one month) Photo Printing Store(Liked this job but the place shut down six months in), Centre Parc Holiday camp (Travel was costing too much so it wasn't worth it so quit 2 months in) and now I'm right back at the Craft shop again. Whenever I quit a job it was always with another one to go to though.

None of these are good jobs or anything to be proud of I feel like I have achieved nothing in 4 years and just found out my youngest brother (18) actually makes more money than me and has a nicer car.

Every year I contemplate going back to uni to do a Masters in TV Production one year I made it as far as going to the open day in Manchester but I just feel like What if it's just another waste of time and I end up in the same position. 

For a while, I couldn't even go to the local shop because the woman that works there kept making sly comments saying ""Oh you work there I thought you'd have a better job ?"" "" Weren't supposed to be the big uni boy and you still work in a shop pfft""

Shes in her 30's with her own kids If it was just someone else my own age it wouldn't bother me but she's an adult so that means all the other adults in my life including my parents probably think this too.

I know my parents probably want me out of their house just for my own sake but with only part-time work, I can't ever guarantee I'll be able to afford the rent each month.

When he started asking me if he could come, I thought nothing of it because I was the same way when I was his age.

A week ago, I noticed that the tumbler on the safe was always in a different position every time I came home from work (My nephew gets home before I do). I felt a little crazy for taking a picture of the tumbler before I left for work but when I came home, it was definitely in a different position. I asked my nephew if he touched the safe and he said no. He responded rather quickly to my question and I had my doubts about his response at first, but I convinced myself that I must have moved it and just didn’t remember doing that, so I moved on for the rest of the day. After I asked him that question, I stopped finding the safe’s tumbler in different positions. Last Friday I called into work and told my boss I was sick, but I left the house the same time my nephew got on the school bus. I drove around the block and waited for the school bus to leave the area and came back to my house. I normally wouldn’t violate a teenager’s privacy by searching their room, but I did exactly that. I found a notebook with a list of combinations that matched the set of possible combinations of my safe. Around 150 combinations were crossed off and yes, I did spot the correct combination on this list of his.

I put the notebook back where I found it and left the house and waited until my nephew returned to come home as if I really did go to work that day. Since that day I took inventory of the guns and ammo in the safe and I have been checking it every day. And before you ask why I didn’t just take the notebook away, it’s because I don’t want to wake up with a knife in my chest. Or why didn’t I just lock the tumbler from moving, it’s because I can’t, the safe is very old (I inherited it from my parents) and it was made before they started putting locks on the safe tumblers. The 3 safes in the basement have these locks but not the one in my office. I’m very freaked out by this and have no idea what to do about this. The other 3 safes are full and cannot hold anymore guns or ammo and I have no one that I can trust to give these guns to while my nephew is living with me. And no, I cannot move the safe in my office to the basement because it is too large to fit through the door that goes into the basement.

If there’s anything you think could help stop my nephew, or maybe figure out why he wants to get into that safe, please tell me because I’ve never dealt with something like this.",True,False,,False,Advice,t5_2qjdm,,249648.0,public,,self,,,I caught my 14-year-old nephew trying all possible combinations of my gun safe,0.0,1556654844.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/biu2a5/i_caught_my_14yearold_nephew_trying_all_possible/,no_ads,0.0

I forgot about it. His parents found out recently and I regret it but I don't know how to proceed. 

About two years ago, I made a new friend. We got along instantly and I was excited because, being a more emotional guy, I tend to get along better with girls so having a guy friend I clicked with was cool. I was 19 and he was 17.

When I met his family, I could instantly feel his parents helicoptering. Nevertheless, they seemed to like me and I ended up getting along with them as well. 

 A few months go by and even thuugh I like the parents as friends, as parents, they're really overbearing. Both parents had a wild youth with lots of drugs etc. and seem to assume that all young people are gonna be crazy like they were. In addition, the dad seemed to have some permanent damage from the drugs. 

My friend would get in trouble for seemingly minor things but then his dad would extrapolate it into a huge explanation as to why that minor thing is actually really important. The saying ""strict parents create sneaky kids"" proved to he true. They care but the harder they squeeze, the harder their two sons try to escape; the younger one, by challenging authority head on and the older one, my friend, by going behind their backs. Which makes the parents squeeze harder which makes the kids rebel more. It's a cycle.

I didn't appreciate it at first, but my family is relatively well adjusted. I never felt smothered and we never really had any problems so the times I got in trouble were few and far between. So when my friend first got in trouble, it seemed like a big deal but it turns out it was the norm in that family. I wanted to sit down and try to explain or just get them to talk to each other but my friend was convinced that they'd never see his point of view and I agree now.

So at some point, he got his phone taken away for like the third time. I decided to let him borrow an old ipod I had which is like a smart phone without the calling and texting. A bit later his parents got a notification that my friend logged into a new device with his email and he made up some story so they wouldn't suspect. He texted me about it in case they asked me. I expressed my distaste for lying to his parents. I told him that the reason his parents don't trust him, is because he isn't hienst with them. He laughed it off and even thuugh I didn't like it, I went along with it.

About a year or two passes by. He and I grew apart. I forgot about the whole thing. Even though I still consider him a friend, we haven't hung out in awhile. I actually talked more with his parents here and there because, like I said, when they're not being parents, they're pretty cool people.

Yesterday, I saw them at a party and they brought up the ipod they found out about recently. I'd totally forgotten about that. I didn't know what to say and they said to think about it and that we didn't have to talk now. So I sat with a knot in my stomach the rest of the party.

They're still overbearing, but that doesn't make what I did right. And getting to know my friend more, I understand why they're so paranoid about him. I feel really bad because I hurt my friends. I hate that idk if they'll trust me again and honestly idk if they should. I regret it but I don't know if I'd do anything differently given the opportunity. My current friends don't seem to go behind their parents backs or they're old enough to have more autonomy.

I honestly don't know what I'm looking for. I've almost managed to get through the period of feeling sorry for myself so I can think straight. Am I a bad person? I don't know how to proceed. Just apologizing doesn't seem like it'd cover it. Should I expect that trust to ever come back? What would you, as a parent, want to hear from me in their place?

I had this problem in the beginning of our relationship, then the problem seemingly disappeared for a wealthy amount of intercourses and now it's back, worse than ever. Things are all okay in the foreplay corner, but when I put the condom on, my dick just dies.

I'm even afraid to initiate anything as the shock of not getting it up pisses me off beyond belief and I don't wish to relive it.

Never had that problem with a previous partner, then again, we lost the condom quarterway into our relationship. Before my current partner, I've also had one night stands, where I just couldn't get it up.

I've tried masturbating with a condom, had longer breaks from porn, I've even had my blood tested for testosterone, which came back with a result of 12.3 nmol/l, which is supposed to be average? I don't usually have problems getting it up myself and I still tend to wake up with the good ol' morningwood.

(TL:DR at the bottom) Starting junior year of high school, I ended up falling in love with this girl (we’ll call her Hannah), more than anyone I had ever met before. I didn’t think she liked me at all, but she confessed mutual feelings for me  at our senior prom. It felt so surreal, and it was the happiest I had been in a long time. 

According to Hannah, she had liked me for around the same time as I liked her, despite having a serious boyfriend and a couple flings in between that time. I shrugged it off due to the surge of emotions I had when I was around her. However, a week after that night at prom, she abruptly called off the building relationship. She said she wasn’t quite over her boyfriend of the serious relationship, of course I understood, he wasn’t the best person after all. Although I was hurt, I subconsciously prepared in case nothing ever came of the two of us, that way we could remain friends; feelings aside, we were great as friends, and that seemed like the least damaging route. Nothing I could have assumed would’ve led to what happened. My friend told me (later confirmed by Hannah herself) that a day before she called off our relationship, she slept with a person she had barely become friends with. I was devastated, but decided it would be best to forgive and forget, since at the time, Hannah wasn’t aware that I knew, and wouldn’t learn of my knowledge until just before we stopped talking.

The next 4-5 months consisted of me being a stepping stone to her to try and prove my worth. I told myself time and time again that she wasn’t worth my time, but I would do the same thing I’ve been doing since we split up; forgive and forget. I even paid for her concert tickets when my friend bailed on me, just to have her drag me to hang out with her friends that also went. I’m sure that if they didn’t leave early, I wouldn’t have spent any time with her all night. The worst instance I can remember is after not talking for almost a month after the concert, she texted me trying to pick her up 30 minutes away from my house and take her to a job interview, and when I said I couldn’t, she made me feel like a horrible person. She tried to apologize to me later, but still ended up getting angry at me.

This all ended when an old friend of mine (we’ll call her Lindsey) and I had a really rough falling out, and Hannah took her side. Now she didn’t explicitly tell me she took Lindsey’s side, but I think blocking me abruptly on every platform  sent the message pretty clear, especially when I keep hearing how close they are through mutual friends.

I’m better off without her in my life, that I know for sure, but even 8 months after I last spoke to her, a one week relationship fucked me up more than any person or pain could’ve caused. I’ve been fine the last couple months or so, but I heard she got a new boyfriend, and I’ve been constantly doubting my own ability to be a good future boyfriend or even a friend in general. I wanna be there for everyone in my life but I can’t be there for myself. I’m sorry for the long story, but it brings me to the advice I need. How can I help myself move on from her and build my self confidence back up?

TL:DR I was in love with a girl for 2 years, was in a short lived relationship with her, then found out she slept with a guy before ending it with me.

He ended up picking up the bill, which I totally was not expecting because I thought it was just friends getting drinks, but I thanked him and we parted ways. 

The only thing is, now I have started seeing a guy that I'm really into, and it just feels wrong going to get drinks with this other guy. Although it hasn't been explicitly said that it's a romantic thing, it definitely is feeling that way. He does message me a lot which I don't mind but I don't want to mislead him or waste his time, but I also don't want to be like, ""Yeah I'm seeing someone so we can never hang out again"" or drop that on him while we are hanging out.

To start off, I'm a 23 year old female. I'm not a special person by any means, I don't believe anyone is, however I have been through experiences and come from a background that had shaped who I am today.  

I almost feel like giving up because absolutely nothing in my life has come easily. Every piece of my identity and every thing I have strived for has only caused me pain, suffering, and heartbreak. To begin:

-  I come from a conservative religious background. My family is of this nature. I went through a great deal of difficulty and pain leaving my religion and having my family figure out about it. It was one of the hardest things I had to figure out and deal with in my life. It is made worse by the fact that I feel the 20 years of my life before that brainwashed by my former religion were a complete waste. This isn't to mention the recurring mental issues I believe I still have as a result of it. 

I cannot come out as having left my former religion to my closest childhood friends because I will lose them if I reveal who I really am. I have to keep up appearances in my society and will never be able to freely speak out against what I believe to be an oppressive belief system, especially for women, if I want to keep my family and friends. This has resulted in me continually feeling suffocated, unable to express my true thoughts, and has given me a multitude of mental issues. What is one to do about this? 

- I come from a perpetually occupied country that is in a continuous state of war. It has no infrastructure, no money, no economy, nothing. I will never be able to return to it normally or travel through it freely, since there are numerous restrictions on those of my background to even enter the country. I have numerous relatives in jail and who have been killed because of these conditions. When I was a child I saw things a child should not ever see. How can I get over this? How can I get over never being able to live in my country or seeing it free? How can I change something that won't ever change? 

- The consequences of leaving my religion left me in a constant state of paranoia, depression, and anxiety throughout my last two years of college, so much so that I feel these years were wasted for me since I did not truly enjoy myself or live my life. I isolated myself to focus on my studies much of the time only to be able to finally graduate and gain my independence. I gained it and some success. I would say this is the most positive outcome that has come about from the past 3 years of my life. 

-  My dating and relationship life has never been a success. Even with some friendships also. Despite the fact that I am described as sociable, attractive, fun and successful by my dates and otherwise, none of it has never worked out for me. I made a bad decision getting involved with a certain man once, it was a 2 year thing, but it was never a real relationship and he treated me so badly. I never anticipated what was to happen with the 2 men I seriously dated after him: they were kind and decent men, but I didn't expect things to end the way they did at all. I've never gotten past 4 months in dating a man. All I get is men constantly hitting on me when I go out, so I can hardly go out alone anymore as it makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. Men have harassed me to the point of depression, since I feel I will never come across a man that will take me seriously like a human being. The times I have, it always ended abruptly for reasons outside of my control. Perhaps it's due to my numerous ""issues"", but I can't change those about me. 

Overall, this is the gist and shortest summary I could write up of all I have experienced and am going through. I have no idea where to begin addressing them. I have too many hang ups and issues. While my experiences have made me stronger in many ways, some days I get extremely depressed and feel I cannot go on anymore. Nothing in my life has ever come easy. I have so much pain inside of me from all these issues combined. These are the things that I think of when alone that seriously cause me depression. The only thing that alleviates them is pursuing a few hobbies that act as a distraction, and going out and interacting with friends and others, but I live in an unfriendly city that isn't that open to strangers speaking to you. I don't fit into one box and feel I can't relate to many others I meet much of the time no matter how hard I try. I feel I don't belong in this society no matter how hard I have tried to adapt. I feel torn between this new culture I am in and my original one which ha resulted in multiple identity issues for me.

Or B, committing to following their passion full time for various reasons. 

I’ve enjoyed martial arts from a young age, I’ve trained in Boxing, Taekwondo and Jiu-Jitsu, though I considered a career in boxing for a while, I have never been passionate enough to pursue it fully.

Around the age of around 12, I discovered mixed martial arts and have been obsessed with it ever since, given my background in three martial arts, I picked up MMA very quickly and was (I dare say) very good at it.

By the time I was 14, I was seriously good, beating people in sparring who were in their twenties. I say this not to come across as cocky, or egotistical, but to illustrate the point that this was very possibly a career option. I feel like I have a natural affinity for MMA and enjoy it thoroughly, I can’t explain the feeling I have regarding it, it’s as if I was destined to do this or something.

I really want to stress the point that I don’t mean to come across as a douchebag, I just say this to explain that I had found something that I am incredibly good at, thoroughly enjoy and that I couldn’t imagine doing anything else, it’s like this is what I am on the planet to do.

Later on when I was between 14 and 15 years old, I had a serious medical issue arise, 22 operations and 3 years later, I am blind in one eye, and have lost considerable sight in my other. I can no longer compete in contact sports at all, not even at a casual, hobby level, so of course, I can no longer purse a career following my passion.

Over the last two years, I’ve done nothing, failed most of my exams, dropped out of education, gained significant weight (5”7 190lbs) and lost the friends that have moved on to sixth form while I was forced to drop out due to grades, or lack thereof.

I’m not in a position where I need help knowing how to get my life back on track, I don’t think, I’m soon to join a gym to begin losing the weight, I’ve had counselling regarding my loss of vision, and have come to terms with that, I’m no longer having trouble dealing with it. The issue now is what do I do as a career? If I had a career to follow I could get back into education, make new friends, build new relationships, but I simply can’t accept following another career. No matter how much I try, I can’t shake the fact that I can’t follow my passion.

I can’t explain how I feel, but as I said earlier, I felt like I was put on his planet to be a fighter, and now, even though I know I can never pursue a career in it, I still subconsciously think I will be able to. When I lose focus and my thoughts end up trailing off, I picture myself as a fighter, when I dream, I often dream of being a fighter. I know it sounds tragic, but I think it’s because for a long time, while I was training at a high-level I drilled into my head the idea that I was going to be a successful fighter and although now I know it’s no longer possible, I can’t stop believing it.

I don’t know what kind of advice to expect, but I think the next step is trying to find a new career, again, I know it sounds insane, but I think subconsciously I also don’t want to find a new career so I don’t have to let go of my passion for fighting, though I know I can’t pursue it anymore.

Thanks for any help, I’ll respond to replies with more information if necessary.

New guy comes to our family get-togethers every week with my aunt. I've noticed (and so has other members of the family) that he has been latching onto my 2 year old daughter during these visits. He'll sit in the floor and play with her (pretty innocent) and is always talking about how cute she is, etc. He was working on Easter and stopped by my family's house for about an hour and made it clear that he was only there to see my daughter. My aunt recently sent me a text saying that he took a picture of my kids visiting the Easter Bunny from her and when she asked him where it was, he said ""the picture of (daughters name?)"" And she responded with ""you know she's not the only kid in that picture!"" That conversation doesn't seem creepy on its own, but in the context of everything else, it made me feel weird. She also just texted me saying that her boyfriend wants me to bring my kids over right now to see him. I said no obviously, but I barely even know this guy. I've had about a dozen conversations with him since they started dating. There's been some other instances that I can't remember off the top of my head, but these stick out the most to me. My husband agrees with me and so do my parents. I need some advice on what I should do next? Am I overreacting by saying that I don't want this guy near my daughter? He shows absolutely no interest in my son (5 years old), or my nephew. It's just my daughter. Do I tell my aunt how I feel? What if he just really likes my kid and doesn't have any bad intentions? At this point, my husband and I have made the decision to never let her be alone with him at any point, which is very obvious, but that means that my daughter isn't allowed be alone with my aunt either. Since she thinks its cute and doesn't find it odd at all, I can't trust her to have the same boundaries. Like if I let my aunt babysit, who knows if her boyfriend will come over and my aunt decides to take a nap or a shower leaving my daughter alone with him. IDK you guys, I'd like some really sound advice and insight right now. What do you think?

I am working as a science teacher - this is my first year, and I have no background in education, student teacher experience, or training. I'm basically an emergency teacher in a state with a teacher crisis.  I have symptoms of mild aspergers, including social difficulty and huge knowledge of specific interests (this is partly why I teach science).  I am currently grieving - my only sibling passed away a year and a half ago in an accident, and that has had a big impact on my life and the way I've chosen to live since then.  I am across the country from home, trying to live completely on my own for the first time. 

I am smoking (usually vaping) weed almost every day. I have noticed myself building up a tolerance, and I have tried to convince myself to quit a couple of times, but I never do. 

Right now, I have nothing in my life except work and personal hobbies (learning guitar, video games, tennis/bar trivia with my roommate). I'm told this is pretty standard for over-worked first-year teachers, but until summer I'm trapped in a situation where I have no time or energy for a meaningful social life, dating, or anything like that.  My job is stressful to the extreme - I am terrified of public speaking, and I do it every day. Every day I come home exhausted, and I'm met with boredom or work until I go to bed. Weed is the perfect solution to everything. I feel good when I'm high, my problems seem to fall into perspective, and I feel motivated to work out and practice guitar - two goals I have been putting off for years. 

I worry that I may be fucking up my brain chemistry. I'm terrified of developing a dopamine problem, which I feel like someone like me is at high risk for. I smoke partly because it makes me feel happy, and using it as a happy pill may really fuck me over in the long run. I am still grieving, and I worry that this may be a bad time to mess with my brain chemistry.  Thing is, I am so desperately bored with my life right now that the thought of quitting now seems really unappealing.  Going a day without weed means having a shittier evening than I would with weed, and despite any desire I have to cut back, when I'm home facing that, I always choose the thing that will allow me to unwind to my fullest. 

So, my gamble is to continue smoking almost daily until summer, and then, when I can actually live a life, cut back. Maybe regulate smoking to weekends only, or something like that. I just worry that I may cause damage between now and then.  Am I being irrational?  I know addicts rationalize things like this, and I just want some outside perspective. I feel a lot of guilt about using, and I sometimes have a hard time telling where guilt ends and legitimate concern begins. 

It's a long read, but if you made it so far, thanks for your time. Let me know what you think. 

TL;DR:  I smoke weed more than I feel like I should, but I don't want to stop in the middle of the semester. I'm looking for outside perspective.

Me and my bestfriend have been bestfriends from the past 14 years. We look after each other's backs. We are like brothers. 

He recently got into a relationship with this girl (22F), and since this is his first ever relationship I understand that he wants to spend more time with her than me. 

Things started going downward spiral when he himself changed as a person. He changed the way he dresses, changed his hairstyle, only goes to expensive restaurants now, attitude issues, bragging, and so on.....

You can really tell the way he props himself, I just don't understand how does she not see it? It's clearly a act. Although, this is not my business so I'll leave it here. 

That being said, from the day he got into the relationship, he barely meets me (we meet every weekend), never picks/returns my calls, doesn't check my messages (sometimes leaves me on read), and kicked me off of his priority list. I don't understand his motive. 

He spends the whole week with her, and still doesn't have the time to talk/meet with me. Is it too much to ask? 

Also, we were supposed to meet two weeks ago, and I called him to remind him about that and he tells me that he's out with his girl shopping so he won't be able to make it in time. I was pissed off so I stressed on our plans, and he told me that I'm no more his priority and cut the call. We haven't talked to each other from then on.

I been through some very rough times, and I'm recovering from PTSD. It was the most humiliating event of my life, but I decided that I DO want to recover. I wanted to share that I don't feel alright - since I WANTED to get better - but definitely not with everyone.  
I knew that I needed support during even casual days, and I decided to pick 3 people, who I actually have trusted. They have supported me through the worst parts, and I thanked them many times.   
I especially felt close to one of my classmates, and I shared a lot of details with her, and she gave a lot of support. I kept doing anything that I could to return the favor. I stood up for her several times, I shared my work, I throw her an amazing birthday party. I felt I need to repay for her attention.  
Out of nowhere she started to act extremely rude with me, which I was blaming myself for it. I couldn't see why, that time. She explicitly told me that what happened to me was my own fault. She shattered all my progress that I have reached with my therapist. I had to restart picking myself up, as she kept repeating that I deserved the brutality, and that people left me because I deserved it. As she was one of the only people I felt close, I kept saying she is right.   


Weeks passed, and under her pressure, I broke down. It was mock exam period, where we are trying out how the actual finals will play out. She kept Facetime-ing me, and telling me how stressed she is and I tried to keep her calm. I ended up saying that I can't pick up the phone all the time - several times a day - to calm her down, because I started to stress out a lot too... she yelled at me and called ungrateful.    
The next day, I experienced the worst panic attack of my life, during my mock exam. I realized that I need to admit to my therapist that this girl been pressuring me. I realized that most of my anxiety is coming from her - or at least - related to her.  


I decided to slowly distant myself, which was hard, because I don't really have any other close friends. I started to focus only on studying and on my online discord server, where I did have some people that I could talk to.  


Last Saturday, I got an invitation to a huge party. I decided to attend, since it was a very formal event, which I secretly really enjoy. I had fun, but decided not to drink. Others on the other hand yes. Several people came up to me and ask me how my therapy was going, and that they are sorry about what have happened to me....  
""Did you report him to the police?"" ""But you are over PTSD by now, right?"" ""It succkkkksss, am so sorry for you!!"" "" You are so strong, f\*ck that guy!""  


I was shocked. I felt like throwing up. I never ever wanted people's pitty or you know. ""The looks"". And suddenly, on my first going out night, since the past 8 months, there was I. In the middle of bullshit, as people were talking about what happened to me.  
I got raging mad. I decided to go around and figure out who was this person. Everyone kept saying one name: The girl who was my close friend.  


I cried for days, I felt observed, exposed, disgusted.   
Later, she passed me a note in class saying:   
""If you think I was the one going around and saying all this shit, you are very f\*cking wrong. I LIED to people about that I don't know why you look horrible, and why are you acting weird.  I HATE lying. I thought we are best friends, that we got each other's back. I never discussed you shit with anyone. I feel disgusted that you even think so. You completely broke my trust.""

I would just link the post, but honestly there’s quite a bunch at this point.


So, my Akita is still missing. My mom sold her and wanted a smaller, cuter puppy, and she bought one and is refusing to tell me where my old dog is. So, I’ve been looking for her everywhere. So far, I’ve tried to extract info from everyone around me, contacted most vets in my country (with more on the list to call), filed my dog as missing with her chip number and some details, and I’ve still got more to do. 


Of course, I still have this new puppy to take care of, almost exclusively by myself. Just like I did with my old dog, since my family had nothing to do with raising it. Though, they do want to play with this cute lil pup sometimes, something they never did with our old dog.

Anyways, now that I know how absolutely repulsive family &amp; moms behavior is towards our animals, I decided to take things into my own hands in a couple of ways. One of them was to finally neuter and register our three year old cat, and take my dog to the vet to have him registered to my name. I went on r/AmITheAsshole to see if I would be wrong in doing this behind their backs, and reddit said I wouldn’t be, so I went through with it. It did not go smoothly at all.

Sparing the details, since it’s 12am and I’m tired as hell after today, my mom hit me, once, and tried to pull my cat off me because she saw me  going to put him into the car. The dog was already in the car at this point. She yelled at me and told my maid to take the cat away. My maid, being on my side but not wanting trouble from mom, took the cat (without the crate) and went inside. I followed, and my mom followed me. She was continually yelling at me while I was looking for my cat, and threatened to hit me for disobeying her. I looked at her and said I’ll call the police if she gets physical on me, because I will absolutely not accept physical abuse of any form from her. So that was when she said “Go ahead and call the police!” and did a small hit on my shoulder. I told her to quit being a child, and kept looking for the cat. My mom was trying to pull the crate from my hands, but I simply held her hand and pulled it away one by one each time. I ended up finding the cat and putting it in a box. Though, because of how she was tailing me, I couldn’t close the crate door and so I had to hold it vertically like a basket and not allowing the cat to jump out. Once I had the cat like this, my mom blocked the doorway outside. I put my back against her and slid past her, barely fitting and she didn’t out up much resistance. I began walking to the car, so then she called me mentally insane and didn’t follow me. I was able to leave.

The cat is gettung neutered now, still at the vet (decided to leave him there)and the dog was registered but not neutered since he’s too young (which I expected).  So that’s how it went. Came back home, mom wouldn’t look at me, as usual.


So, during all that yelling while I was trying to find my cat,  she said a lot of things that were extremely worrying. How she’d do to my cat and dog like she did to my old Akita, how she’d resell the new puppy. For about two hours now, I’ve been looking for dog/cat collars online that have GPS tracking and won’t unlock unless accessed by me, so that I would have my pets locations at all times and my mom wouldn’t be able to remove them. If she sold them, locating them would be easy this way. I wanna know how I can do that, if any of you can tell me...and uhm, I guess this really is an abusive family. 


Honestly, the story is pretty warped up there. A lot of details were spared because I am seriously not bothered to type them at the moment, I apologize. Though, it gets accross the main events and how my mom acted, which is all that really matters. I know that I didn’t ask for any specific advice, but honestly please fill me in with any info that might help me.

He had some good reasons (finances, job security, etc), but I think he ultimately just wanted out. Eventually through a month of counseling, we decided to end things and it was so painful, and definitely not what I wanted. It hurt like hell. But looking back, and after doing some self reflection, I realized we both had issues, and we very young and naive. I actually took a lot of the blame for things, realizing that I wasn’t perfect. 

Fast forward a year and a half of awkward encounters and minimal contact, we actually ended up getting back together. It started out good especially because we both had grown from our immature past. But slowly I saw that I think he was honestly just lonely and horny, and wanted someone to be with. I really cared about him and wanted the best for him. He was going through a depressive state and some issues at work, and I was there whenever he needed to vent or talk about things. I didn’t mind being there for him, but the minute I wanted or needed him to be there for me he wasn’t. And he was just passive... wouldn’t start communication, wouldn’t initiative spending time together. I gave him grace because of his depression (knowing personally how hard that is) but it was hard to know whether or not he wanted to be together.

Eventually, he ended up breaking things off AGAIN. But here’s the reason why: he said it was because we didn’t share the same faith/religion (he was a Christian turning atheist, and I am Christian but NEVER pushed my beliefs on him), which I think was just a cop out. The more interesting thing is a week before he broke up with me, his brother broke up with his long time girlfriend.. reinforcing my belief that he was just lonely and horny, and wanted someone to be with. It was hard for me because I loved him... the initial love never went away. It’s hard to forgot someone you imagined spending forever with (and at one time planned to spend forever with). But I just felt used and played. 

THIS IS WHERE I NEED THE ADVICE: 
Two months after our second breakup, he started dating this older girl who looks like me physically, apparently has a very similar personality (so my friends tell me), AND who is Christian. It really tore me apart, not so much that he was with someone else, but that someone I trusted so much could lie to me and use something so personal like my faith as a reason to break up. 

In two weeks, there is a work reunion... and he’s bringing her. And I REALLY don’t want to meet her. I’m sure she’s a very nice girl, and I honestly would probably get along with her. But back when I first found out he was dating her, I went through a bad mental breakdown, full of comparison and depression. It was not good. I’ve grown so much in the last six months and I don’t want to go back to that place mentally, especially seeing him with her.

Any advice? Anyone been through this before? I have to go because I’m coordinating the event (yeah, he sent his RSVP back to ME with his and her name on it.. talk about a coward). I honestly get a knot in my stomach thinking about seeing them together. It just hurts, you know? Any advice is welcomed. 

TL;DR: my ex and I have a very complicated history full of betrayal and a lot of emotion (broken engagement, got back together, lied, etc). He’s bringing his new girlfriend to a work reunion, and I just really don’t want to go but I have to.

Every movie, commercial, even sappy songs. It was almost endearing when I was growing up.

But now as an adult, I feel like it’ll set me back in my career. I just get overwhelmed so easily my emotions, whether it’s gratefulness, happiness, anxiety, or sadness, my heart feels heavy and I uncontrollably cry. Not a few tears, unfortunately, but more like waterfalls.

Recently, I had a slip up at work, and I knew I effed up. And I talked to my boss, and he expressed that he was disappointed in me. I recognized that I was in the wrong, why/what I did wrong, and knew how I could improve going forward. Still, though, I started crying. I hate disappointing people but I didn’t think this was that big of a deal of a conversation that I would cry a lot in front of my boss. Yet I did. I was so embarrassed. I’m young and new to the company, and I want to establish myself as strong and stable...and this was the last thing I wanted. I couldn’t stop myself.

I was so apologetic and tried to reassure my boss that I just often can’t control my emotions. While he said it was okay and he understood, I still am afraid he’d perceive me as basically child-like for not having a better hold of my emotions.

Now, I have a periodic work review coming up with the same boss, and I have been anxious about it. I want to have an open conversation and hear constructive advice from him, but I’m afraid I’m going to cry...just because I always do.

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on how I can stay composed at this meeting and going forward. Therapy is probably going to be an important step but I’m on a really terrible health care plan right now and I can’t afford it. I hope to be on a better plan next year and actually go to therapy then. 

Other info: I was diagnosed w anxiety and depression, and I used to take meds for them. I’ve been moving a lot in the past three years though and finding a new doctor m/renewing prescription for that hasn’t been affordable, so I’ve been off my meds for about two years. I’d say I was the same level of emotional even when I was medicated.

I had one paid summer internship when I made fliers and a website for a landscaping company. My client my happy with the website, but I wasn't. Since they weren't interested in buying their own domain and host, I ended up making a Weebly site for them. Kinda felt like a waste of talent and no real work besides the fliers. The pros are the money and experience; cons are that it doesn't count towards my degree due to its length and it's not really resume/portfolio material. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have another internship opportunity with a company that sells Life Insurance. It's similar to the previous, but they're more into eCommerce/sales: things that I have no interest or knowledge in. Also they want me to use Wix and Click Funnels, both of which are template builders like Weebly. 

Pros

* paid
* possible resume material  

Cons

* no school credit due to length (so I'll have to take a substitute class only available 2nd semester)
* tight schedule (unlike the previous, this'll be during the school year, I have a job, and have to share vehicles which'll make it difficult to travel)
* future employers might not see this or the other internship as eligible experience

Honestly I don't want it, I just want to focus on school, but they seem really desperate for somebody and the money can go towards my savings. I don't want to waste their and my time since I don't have expertise in eCommerce/sales; I think they could find better, but I'd feel guilty and selfish turning it down.

She is also very unstable and while charming at times, other times she is rude and makes no sense. Imagine a really mean Moira Rose.

I’ve never done a drug in my life. I was working. She has never worked a day in her life so I suppose she’s never been “in the zone”.

I just decided then I was exhausted of her and this morning I left her a message saying very kindly that I felt the conversation yesterday was aggressive and as a friend it’s my duty to tell her how I made her feel.
I was working for hours after so when I left the office I saw a bevy of messages that started kind enough, but became more and more irate as time went by- telling me what awful manners I have and how dare I ruin her day with an accusation of this sort.

She's now acting like she has every right to ""disown"" me now just because I have this money, and I don't just mean financially cut me off but she wants absolutely nothing to do with me. She keeps saying ""you have your money now!!! it's time for you to get out and stop living under my roof!!!"" and yes I know, even though she's not obligated to still be taking care of me... it's still barely been a month of adjusting and her whole demeanor towards me has changed. She's constantly cold towards me and finding reasons to argue. She does a lot of emotional abuse. We used to be somewhat close before the money, but now her true colors are showing. She seemed to have been waiting for the moment for me to be out of her life. I'm really hurt.

She's making me feel like I'm not even blood related to her like I'm a literal alien to her thats bothering her with my existence. She's now treating me like the biggest nuisance and stress to her life even though like I said Im the exact same and go about my business doing the exact same things. Money just seems evil. It's like theres always always a catch. It's never easy breezy even when a windfall is handed to you. You always win something then lose another. I can't explain the type of pain I felt when she flat out said she was excited for me to receive this windfall so I could just get out of her life.

Any good ways to teach a Southerner to pronounce the name Susmitha? Or perhaps a creative nickname that they can say without destroying her individuality? (My parents have suggested they call her Sara but that’s no dice.)

Also, I am a female. 

When I was a freshman in high school, my friend at the time invited me to a youth group she had recently joined. I then started attending around September. There were around 4-5 youth group leaders and the youth pastor, during the first few weeks of meeting them nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 

It wasn't until almost a month later when I noticed I was being treated differently from one of the male leaders, who I will call Bryan. I don't know Bryan's exact age but I know for sure he is in his late 40's, maybe 50 now and he is married with a kid. (I've only met his wife a handful of times)

 It was during a Halloween event Bryan was in charge of, when I noticed he clung to me. Throughout the event he stood constantly beside me and only talked to me. There was a haunted house at the event my friend and I were in line for when Bryan came up to go in with us. Right before entering I was holding on to my friends arm, then Bryan asked if I could hold on to his arm, which I did. During that night we exchanged phone numbers, when I got home he texted me how happy it made him that I was there, next to that many emoji's including hearts. I was 14 at the time this happen. This might not seem like a big deal and it might not be, but I remember feeling uncomfortable and even guilty that I was the only we he payed attention to that night.  

Then during a Thanksgiving event that couldn't make it to, he texted me to take pictures of his son there. I did but instead of saying thank you, he began texting me like a peer would. I believe he used his son as an excuse to talk to text me. I left the youth group for the rest of the year since I felt so uncomfortable being around him 

Then during my sophomore year of high school when I just turned 15 I started going again. It was like nothing changed. Bryan was always next to me talking to me and gave bear hugs every time he saw me and when I left. I must add, he never hugged anyone else at youth group besides me. I always got text's from him asking if I would be at youth group. I remember a specific text from him saying ""Hey girl, will I be seeing you tonight"". I feel like him texting me was questionable, but the way he texted me was even more questionable. Bryan also announced the announcements in front of everyone before the sermon would start. While he was up there he always stared as if he was only talking to me. My friends caught on to this and began teasing me calling him my ""creeper"". With my friends catching on I began to see this as a game. 

This went on until my Junior year of high school. Bryan constantly called me cute and invited me out to non-youth group related events (which I never went). I felt like his pet at youth group. He always took selfies with me and complemented me, again he never did that to anyone else but me. I was the first one he told when he said he was leaving youth group and would no longer be a leader. During that time he texted me things like how much he would miss me and how he loves me. 

The last time I've seen Bryan I was 17, and a senior in High school. I only went to youth group for a short amount of my senior year and stopped going after October. During a high school football game I ran into Bryan, I hadn't seen him since he left youth group. He gave me 2 hugs during the first three minutes of interacting with him. He asked if i wanted to go to the snack bar with him, I agreed to go. The whole time he complemented me on how good I looked. He then offered to buy me food, I asked for a Coke. When I thanked him he said ""your welcome, I want to buy you more things"" then hugged me. When I got home he texted me saying how great it was to see me and how he would like to continue seeing me with many heart emoji's. I've seen him once after that at yet another Halloween event (which he wasn't with youth group). He texted me to hangout with him at that Halloween church event and I did. It was very awkward and I knew something wasn't right. Again he complemented and took selfies with me. Bryan talked to me as if there wasn't an big age gap between us. After I left he as always texted me how nice it was to see me. I felt guilty and disturbed after. 

Bryan still has my number but now chooses to message me through Snap chat. To this day he still texts me randomly and even comments on my selfies. Although, I haven't had a conversation with him since the last time I've seen him. 

Now during the four years I interacted with him Bryan NEVER touched me. Bryan NEVER asked for anything sexual from me. Was Bryan just friendly or was he too friendly? I'm not sure if I'm just over thinking this. I knew something was off with Bryan but I allowed him to get close to me. I think maybe out of lack of attention I lead him on. I would brag to my friends how Bryan would text me and how he was nice to me. I feel embarrassed by this now and guilty how I went about this. My two friends knew everything that happen but we just joked around about it.  I am now 18 and think about this a lot. I never told anyone about this so I'm not sure about other peoples thoughts on this.  I've missed so many other details but this post is long enough.

tl;dr: Friend's ex-boyfriend shows up at her house unexpected and unwanted, refuses to stop calling her and messaging her, calls her names, when he is angry, accuses her of things that aren't true, and basically is emotionally abusing her. He will not leave her alone despite her requests to, and she is afraid to report him because he is a cop. What should she do?

My friend has been seeing this guy for a little over a year. It was not serious - it started off as just someone to spend time with and occasionally go out with. They didn't start calling each other boyfriend/girlfriend until only a couple months ago. She ended the relationship with him because he tried to take the relationship to the next level (moving in together) which she was not comfortable with and also because he has a very bad temper and she just didn't see the relationship going anywhere.

Since she ended things, he does not stop calling and texting her. She blocked his number, and he has showed up at her house about 3x, all unexpectedly and unwanted, and he would not leave when she asked him to. He forces her to see him and talk to him, then gets mad at her for not wanting to hang out with him.

Yesterday her and I were out, and he found out where we were, showed up, and yelled at her in public. That was my first time meeting him, and he honestly sounded so crazy and delusional (I hope he was drunk because if he wasn't, he has a warped perception of reality and is really, really, irrational and crazy). He said a lot of weird things, like ""I'm literally just trying to talk to you. I'm not yelling at you!"" even though he was definitely yelling, he accused her of being with another guy, and then maliciously brought up the fact that she has a daughter (whom she didn't introduce him to, but he ended up meeting recently when he showed up at her house one day and invited himself in). When he is mad, he yells out anything he can - such that she is a slut, a whore, stupid, a bad mother, etc. This is definitely abusive behavior.

She is afraid to call the cops because he IS a cop. She thinks the other cops will just take his side, and then he will be even angrier and crazier with her for reporting him. She is scared of him (and I am too), so she just does nothing. What should she do? His behavior absolutely isn't okay. For reference, he is with the NYPD.

I’ll try to add what’s relevant. We have been living together for about 4 months now. Their dad doesn’t really have contact with the two boys who are 9 and 6.  

I take care of the boys from time to time. Che recently changed her job but there was a time for about 1.5 months where I would take care of them from about 4:30 until their bedtime, cooking and cleaning after them. I am often asked to buy their meals, which I don’t mind because I care about them and want them to be well taken care of. 

Anyways, they have one charger for their 3ds and apparently they needed two chargers. I know that they do not really take care of their things, so when my gf asked me if she could borrow mine, I said I didn’t want to because I was afraid they might break it. (It costs about 2.00$ but it’s the only one I have at the moment.) 

She said she would replace it if they broke it and I said fine. 

She came to me after a few more minutes telling me that I made her sad earlier. She said, “I thought they were more important to you than that.” 

I said that they are important, but I don’t loan my things out to someone who won’t take care of them. She said, yeah, but they are the boys! Their are different. She said that if I would loan anything to her, they are a part of her so I shouldn’t be stingy. I just don’t feel like I’ve done anything wrong.

I feel unbelievably happy when I'm with someone. Abnormally happy. When I see basic suburban neighborhoods, it makes me feel the same as when I go to, say, a concert. Excitement, I've spent so long pent up away from places, people, that I've idyllized simple aspects of life. I've never gone clubbing or been to a bar or even just sat with someone when it's warm out and then got intimate with them. I've spent my life building scenarios of happiness in place of an actual existence, a social life, etc. and now that I occasionally get tastes of these things, I obsess over them. Because it's like I'm able to step into these dreams I've always had temporarily. I get to live the life I've always wanted, but it's rationed out to me in small doses that leave me craving it like crazy the rest of the time. It's like an addiction. And when I'm not in those moments anymore, I need evidence they happened. Physical proof, pictures, videos, objects, and I bask in my memories (it's not that I don't believe they happened, it's that it hurts less when I'm not in the moment). All I want is to go back. And all I look for are ways to go back. I like to take pictures of everywhere I am. Imagine you have a dream that you want to remember and you're able to take pictures of it, wouldn't you take all you can get? Wouldn't that be fascinating, you'd want to relive something that tantalized you? This is essentially what it's like for me. I generally want to record all of my sexual encounters. I was a virgin until I was 18. I think this sudden living of the life I fantasized about is...shocking to me. I don't feel like I deserve it, I don't even feel like I'm living my life. Feels like I just became someone else who could do shit like this (not literally, it's just sensational). I have pretty severe depression and I know that my life is only continuing to get worse, but I keep downing shots of my ideal vision of life and then the rest of the time I have the worst hangover.

I worry about what this is doing to my psyche. Obsessing over people I've just met, finding myself checking messages over and over, analyzing shit until I ruin my day over it. It doesn't help that people can be untrustworthy and every time I try to stabilize and say ""This person probably likes me, stop thinking they don't, it's irrational and they've given you no reason to believe you they don't like you""...they always prove in some way that they don't like me. And I keep all these feelings inside, I don't let them show, so I know it's not this aspect that's freaking them out or anything. I just feel like every mechanism and idea I use to convince myself that it's wrong to be so defensive, only becomes incentive to put up defenses later on.

I guess my last issue is...I wonder what's outwardly wrong with me. Every guy that I go on a date with tells me they can't fathom why I would be single, they all tell me my personality is incredible and rare to find, that I'm easy to get along with, intelligent, attractive...and I don't think much of myself at all. But based on all of them saying that, why am I still alone? I just don't understand.

I'm a college graduate. I don't have much experience. I started working here in June, there's only two people in IT, which are me and my boss. So we share an office with the finance department. Our division head is the director of finance. 

I have a lot of free time in my office when there's not much troubleshooting going on, I would normally just write some code. apparently she doesn't like that. she wants me to help around, and do some finance work. 

so far my tasks haven't been really intimidating, it took me some time to figure it all out. Even now I'm still confused, but I'll learn how to do it right. I don't have a background in finance, so this is kind of a shock to me as well. 

Right now I'm job hunting, looking to work in the programming field. I'm actually not ready to leave yet. I work at a five star hotel chain, in which I have the privilege to eat for free three times a day, getting to meet people and socialize, walking around in this massive hotel and sight seeing. My IT boss is very kind.it's pretty great. 

But I'm afraid I'll never be a programmer. so today I applied for a position in programming, even though I'm not really sure about leaving. But one thing I know for sure, is that I'll ask for a higher salary. Because I already have a job at this hotel, I have a stronger bargaining power. I'm not desperate enough to ask for the same amount of salary I'm getting right now. 

I'm always regretting the decision I make. Damn if I do, damn if I don't. I'm pretty sure being a programmer at some office isn't as fun as working in a hotel, but at least I'll be able to do what I've always wanted to do. 

When I leave this hotel, I'll never see my friends again. I'll have to say goodbye to my boss, which is hard because he's been very good to me. I'll never walk around the hotel to troubleshoot anything, my programming job is sitting in a cubicle from start to finish. 

I'll regret leaving, but right now I do feel like I need to take this risk in order to get where I want to be.

But still, it seems like people are not drawn to me. It's not that they avoid me, it's just that I feel that they perhaps think I'm awkward, dull or uninteresting. I suck at telling stories and I'm often nervous in social situations which makes be stutter sometimes and my tone of voice is all over the place.

Therefore I have no real friends except maybe my coworkers, but I rarely hang out with them outside of work. I have difficulties forming connections with other people. 

Would appreciate advice on how I can make better connections with people and how I can be a better conversationalist.

My best friend told him about how he liked her and he made his move after that and lies to his face about it for months, made her say nothing because 'he wanted to handle telling it to others'. The worst part about this is that he started to talk trash to the chick about his oldest friend, for whatever reason, maybe to discredit him and fortify his position he also talked very badly about his GF and how he was just looking for a way out. Its absolute scumbag-level shittyness.
He is in a relationship and his girlfriend, who took him in when he lost his flat, supported him financially when he lost his job, who was carrying his frigging child during the time of those events, doesn't know a thing about all this.
So I know I won't be hanging out with him anymore, because people who treat others like this can f right off in my book.
I am just unsure about whether or not I should tell his girlfriend about the whole thing. I'm friends with her too but being a single mom sucks, even though she has a great job. But being cheated on in such a dirt bag way... I would want to know.

She also offered to shout me out on her page. With this in mind I decided to go for it and have spent months working on this, taking sample pictures and baked my butt off. She did shout me out and it was great, I got 200 followers in a day. I branded myself on cookies, cupcakes, pies and more. Unfortunately, she is also expanding her menu now and we both thought of fudge around the same time, but she listed it first so I figured whatever, she can have that and I will do other things. But now she has listed cupcakes, cookies and brownies...basically my entire menu minus the pies. Im confident in my product so this would be fine if she was not also telling me what she plans on doing (bread, fudge, etc) with the instructions that I dont do the same stuff as her.

Update: She claims she made cupcakes and cookies first when confronted by my boyfriend. She has been doing this for 3 years, she has probably made everything at some point.

I constantly compare myself with her - for some reason. For example, she worked multiple jobs, I don’t have any - so I feel like crap. She was athletic and sporty, I’m not - so I feel like crap. She was beautiful and funny, I’m lonely - so I feel like crap.

I’ve seen a therapist for a while now who diagnosed me with low self-esteem causing low mood and anxiety.

However, she constantly brings up conspiracy theories like 9/11 was an inside job, the gov't is putting too much fluoride in our water to kill us, Beyonce is part of the illuminati, Wendy Williams passing out on TV was a request from the illuminati to divert people's attention away from a terrorist attack that happened that day, and so many more. 

I personally find them cringy and stupid, but I have no problem with people who believe in them.

She goes on and on trying to prove them to me and asking me how I don't believe, why I don't believe, etc. I never insult her or anything because that's disrespectful, but it's genuinly draining. I never really say much back because it would lead to a fight. 

This isn't an everday occurance, it just sometimes pisses me off feeling like i'm walking on eggshells around her, trying not to say something that will provoke her to tell me about a stupid theory.

However, she's blown me off and either not responded or told me she'd let me know when she's available. 

I'm so incredibly torn on this situation. On one hand, I believe that the maid of honor position should be given to the person closest to me, not just handed to someone because they are related. But I also know, that if I don't ask her, she will always hold a grudge and any potential we have for a future relationship would be shattered. 

I've come up with a compromise that makes me feel slightly better but not much. I'm only having two bridesmaids. My best friend and (potentially) my sister. I'm having my best friend as matron of honor(because she's married) and my sister as maid of honor.

I am incapable of keeping things brief.  
  
I have suffered from depression for a while. It started my sophomore year of high school, and was already festering when I entered college.  
Freshman year of college, my alcoholic emotionally abusive father passed away unexpectedly, and it hit me very hard. I had believed his death wouldn't affect me too much, but that was because I was young, naive, and (as always) trying to protect myself.  
Around a year ago I woke up with a feeling of dread and absolute misery. The weight of depression was tangible, and I called off work because I knew that I couldn't make it through the shift without breaking down. Instead I drove to my girlfriend and my apartment and tried to hang myself.  
Our cat came over at once and began to meow loudly while he wrapped himself around my legs. I stopped and brought him to bed and just cried. I still to this day worry that I only did it to convince myself that I was truly sad.  
My girlfriend rushed home as soon as I called her. She was not angry at me for getting fired (the bosses decided I had missed too much training due to my girlfriend and I just getting back from out of state for her grandfathers unexpected funeral). She was not disappointed in me. She just wanted to take care of me.  
She told me take my time finding my next job because she didn't want me to feel pressured, and her job paid well enough to support us both.  
I allowed my depression to swallow me whole, and I proceeded to go unemployed for 6 months. I was always searching, but I let my fear and self-pity keep me in bed for the vast majority of the time. I didnt know what I was supposed to do.  
She had always expressed interest in moving across the country to live closer to her parents and grandmother. Around 4 months of unemployment, I agreed. I think I was hoping to help her to have a better support system in case I had another potentially more fatal breakdown.  
So we moved across the country. And, as I'm sure none of you will be surprised by, depression came along for the ride.  
Since then, I proposed to my girlfriend. It took a very long time for me to make the decision. Our relationship has gone through some fairly severe ups and downs. For a long time, I convinced myself that I didnt want to marry her because we had too many negative memories between us.  
Then I started to realize, I was just afraid, as I always am. She is not perfect, but she is perfect for me. She cares so deeply for me, and her endless, determined love for me is larger and better than every negative thing in my life, internally and externally combined.  
But I have been and continue to be afraid that I am cursed. Destined to stew in my own despair and self-pity forever. I dont want to drag her down with me.  
But she convinced me that we could make it through together. And when I think about the rest of my life being with her, it suddenly isnt so bad.  
I want to get better for her, and be a good husband and eventually a good father; I just dont know how.  
I have been job hopping since college at different businesses that I am miserable at. Places that treat me like crap, or bore me to death.  
Every time I look at job opportunities, my heart tells me that I am supposed to be a performer. It is my passion, and it is the only ""career"" that I am actually happy doing.  
But I can't trust my emotions or my gut feelings, because depression has left me feeling numb for a while now. When I'm not with my fiancé, most of my emotions are mentally concocted based on what I believe I should be feeling. I only feel comfortable to be myself when I'm with her.  
I am going to be her husband soon, and I dont have any idea if I'm going to be pursuing performance art, working at a 9-5 job just so she can have stability, or if I am determined to job hob for the rest of my life. Not knowing is excusable (who really knows what the future holds), but it is my fear of failing or making the wrong choice that is preventing me from going forward with anything concrete.  
My fiancé has allowed me to take time to focus on being an actor but every time I try, I am incapable of fully dedicating myself, lest I risk discovering I'm not good enough.  
I am currently on depression medicine as well as thyroid medication. I try to take it consistently, but I miss taking them at least once a month.  
I have OCD, dermatillomania, anxiety, and often mood swings (but not bipolar). I often go months without brushing my teeth or showering. For some reason, I do not smell bad, but my teeth are starting to show signs of neglect, and it's also just disgusting.  
I occasionally will think about doing them, but I never can find the energy. I do not feel a sense of accomplishment after taking a shower.  
But, more often than not, I wont think about showering or my teeth, or my medicine, etc, for days. I'm just on autopilot, focusing all of my energy on making sure I go to work and dont get fired.  
I have seen multiple therapists before. But I have never stuck it out with one. I am so afraid of opening up to someone week after week, and hearing their advice.  
I wont let myself succeed. It's too scary to try, so I throw a wrench into the system before I can risk failing and the waves of self-loathing that will follow.  
The job I am at now is awful, but the insurance is incredible. I am trying to stick it out so I can go see a decent psychiatrist and have my medication reevaluated.  
I occasionally look for acting jobs, but I haven't brought my best to an audition since college.  
I don't know why I'm posting my life story on here. I've been very sick this week, but still had to work 40+ hours at my very physical job. Today is my Friday, so maybe this is just my release now that I finally dont have to return to work tomorrow.  
I dont expect anyone to have the magical answer for me. No simple solution exists that will make it all better.  
But I hope people with similar experiences can give me some advice. Any advice.  
I am trying to get on a diet to help me lose weight (I have always been overweight), I am working constantly so I'm at least helping to provide for my fiancé, I am constantly analyzing my decisions and actions to see if I could improve or at least apologize when i am wrong. I have gotten a dog because I thought having a best friend that will motivate me to get outside every day would help me get better. I am trying to exercise more, eat less fast food, and not make suicide jokes.  
But I also am just quitting smoking again, smoking pot 4+ times a week, sleeping in until my 1 PM shifts start, picking, not bathing, and not excelling at my job because I'm constantly zoned out during every shift.  
In the back of my mind, I think I unfortunately still believe that there is a fix all. Moving across the country, marrying my soul mate, getting a cat, getting a dog, using marijuana, changing medicine. I keep hoping that I'll just find the cure that makes me all better. But the thing that really scares me is that even with every one of those things in my life, depression is still crushing me. I feel like I'm running out of ideas on how to fight back. And it's been so long since I've been without depression, I don't really know who I am without it. It's oozed into the foundation of my personality. When I occassionally have a big mood swing and I suddenly don't feel depressed at all anymore (usually this happens once every 3 months, for an hour or two), I'm just insanely energetic and incredibly annoying just as I was in high school before depression was part of how I defined myself.  
Right now I'm focused on two main points: not letting the multitude of voices in my head take such a toll on me, and seeking help. I dont think I'll be able to handle the former without first completing the latter.  
I am struggling to stay at my job long enough for the insurance to kick in, though. I am absolutely miserable there. But I feel like I have to go to a more expensive psychiatrist because I worry that if I go to a cheap one, they wont be able to assist me as well.  
I don't want to be this way anymore. I want to be happy, successful, a great husband, and eventually a great father.  
I thought leaning on my fiancé was the solution for so long, but I eventually realized that she wasnt lifting me up from my depression, but I was dragging her down into it with me. I dont know how she wouldn't, being with me 24/7 and me being constantly unhappy and talking about this.  
I still worry that I'm just lazy. My family has always told me that I've had a problem with laziness, similar to my late father. I dont know anyone else that is like me, so I cant help but think that maybe the majority of my depression is just enjoying sleeping for 14 hours at a time.  
I dont know if anyone will read any of this, let alone all 30 chapters. I cant seem to make/maintain any friendships outside of my fiancé, and I dont really have anyone to talk to about this. I hate bringing people down with my own shit, and I never people to see how self-pitying, repetitive, and scared I am.  
If I feel like I am supposed to be a performer and everything within me tells me that it's my destiny, do I follow it? Is it ridiculous? Should it be more of a hobby?  
Are there solutions that I have been missing and should be trying?  
Am I just a piece of shit and I need to just stop letting myself stew?  
It's okay if this doesnt get any attention. I'll probably delete it (and this throwaway account) in the morning in embarrassment.  
I just dont know what to do. I feel like I'm trying so hard. I am trying to make steps in the right direction. But every time I look at my fiancé and see how much of a drain on her I am, I often wish that my cat hadn't intervened. It would have been a horrible thing to do to my family, friends, and her. But I'm a coward, and having them watch me just stagnate and rot while I fail over and over and over again is too much.  
P.S. I'm not going to kill myself. I am sad, but my cat, my puppy, and my fiancé are already more than enough reason to keep trying. And that's only a microscopic portion of the amazing things in my life I have to be appreciative for. I have a lot of good in my life, which makes it hurt that much more that I still am the way I am.  
Okay, if you actually read this whole thing, kudos. Why did you do it? Go get help for your masochism.  
Good night.

I did it because I felt she wasn’t treating me right at the time. This was about 8 months ago. We were together for 3 years and deeply in love. We were that couple that people aspired to be. When we broke up, it was short and simple. We haven’t talked since. I felt like since she didn’t try getting me back and vice versa, that our relationship was over. So I guess there has been a lot of feelings left unsaid. Not to mention, we live about 3 hours away from each other. She will pop up occasionally on her friends social media and on my friends as well. I’ve unfollowed her on all platforms.

The past two weeks, I’ve been having vivid dreams about us. Some of them are in my favor, where she wants to get back with me and misses me. Or me rejecting her advances. The others are her having sex with other guys and still wanting to be back with me. Or me finding out that she’s moved on with another guy, and it drives me crazy.

How do I conquer this? I’ve not even tried to date because of my new job taking up so much of my life. And I’m afraid to talk to her because it’ll be the first time since we broke up and I feel like I’ll have residual feelings there. Or I’m scared to find out that she’s moved on from me with another guy or has had sex with another guy (I was her first but she wasn’t mine).

Over these past 8 months, it’s been a rollercoaster for me. Some weeks I’m completely over her and cannot even fathom being in a relationship. But at times I just want to yell into the phone “I miss you so much!!!! Why shouldn’t we be together. Please tell me you’re not seeing anyone or haven’t seen anyone.” And at other times I’ve moved on.

My anxiety really all comes down to my fear of being alone or being viewed as lesser by my peers. 
I know where the fears stem from but it’s not worth writing all out on this post. I don’t know how to get over it, tonight could’ve been a great night to overcome my fear and walk into the party like I own the place. All my friends would’ve greeted me and offered me a drink or something (like every other time i go to a party) and yet the voice in my head convinced me that when I walk in there it’s gonna be a train wreck and I’ll be seen as lesser.

My best friend of 14 years and I have been inseparable since middle school. A little over a year ago, she started hanging out with a coworker she met and brings her whenever our friend group goes out on the weekends. I have no problems with this other girl at all, we get along great. But lately, they stopped inviting me places. We haven’t hung out in over a month and she almost never responds to my texts anymore. But she’s always posting pictures of them and my friends house with captions like “with my best friend” or something. I asked her if I did anything to upset her and she said “of course not”. I obviously didn’t want to make it a big deal, so I just said okay. 

But here’s the thing. My boyfriend asked me my ring size recently and had the future talk. So I know he’s going to propose in the near future. My best friend and I always promised that we would be each other’s MOH. She knows I would pick her. But I’m not sure she would do the same for me now. And if she did, she would probably have me share the spot with the other girl.

I know this all seems so petty, especially at my age. But you can’t help how you feel. But I don’t know what I should do.

My parents got divorced and it tore me apart. My mom told me she doesn’t love me anymore when she left and my dad talked about making her take care of me, because I was “too difficult”. I didn’t have much to do with my mom until I turned 18. I was seeing a guy (not dating) and he went on a family vacation with myself, my mom, and my “stepdad”. He (the guy I was talking to) had to leave a little bit early but said he would be back (this happening after I wouldn’t have sex with him because I really liked him and was afraid he wouldn’t like me if it was bad) so I suspected he didn’t like me anymore because I wouldn’t do what he wanted and I noticed he had taken all of his belonging but his mattress and pillows, so I told him I’d do whatever he wanted if he came back. He said we could only be friends after that because my statement made him uncomfortable. He was supposed to come back the next day so I waited on him 8 hours just to get a text saying he wasn’t coming. I cried about that for a long time. I met a guy I didn’t know to give him oral because I thought it would be good to have practice (I know it wasn’t safe or smart) and now he doesn’t message me anymore. He was messaging me multiple times a day and now he doesn’t even respond to me half of the time.


Neither of my parents have jobs and neither do I. I’m currently in college but living at home and I’m home alone if I’m not at school. Nobody knows it, but I’ve been really suicidal. I planned exactly how I’d do it if it ever got too bad. 

Both of my parents have anxiety and depression, but I don’t feel like I can talk to them. When I mentioned it to my sibling, she tell me it’s stupid and I need to get over myself. She has called me names since childhood and it’s really affected my self esteem.

I’m sorry this post is so long, and I have a lot of unnecessary detail, but I feel like it would give reasons why I feel this way.

She’s a 50 something woman, with a teenage boy, a stable job and no mental illness. At the beginning, we were nice and chatted, but she keeps knocking for stupid stuff and it’s unbeareable. Knocks to inform what she bought at the grocer’s, why she went to an annual doctor check up, to tell what his poor kid (who’s super polite) does with his life, what they told her at the bank, that she’s going on holiday, and all sorts of stupid stuff you could imagine.

Take into account this is Spain, and like in many other countries, hospitality is a must, but I have come to a point that I go out to hang my laundry sneaking so she doesn’t peek and starts chatting by almost hanging her body from a four storey building.

My girlfriend and I are both 31, have been together for 8 years and we are still deeply in love. I can honestly say, that she has made a better man out of man. Before her I was a neckbeard through and through (without the fat and body odor), thought my shit smelled better than other's just because I had good grades in primary school and have an above-average intelligence. She stood with me and changed me into the man I am today. Not the best man, but a man who sees the errors of his past, is deeply ashamed of them and tries to be a good person.

I have always been a rather introvert person in the sense of that I like being social with friends and my loved ones but it is EXTREMELY draining for me and after 2-3 hours it's like a switch in my brain that activates and tells me to find a quiet place where I can be just to myself and not talk to anyone. My girlfriend is the opposite: Whilst I need silence and seclusiveness to ""recharge"", she needs to be around people, meet with new people and ""do stuff"". On a free sunday she sees the need the plan stuff, i see the need to do nothing. This has never really been a problem for us, because we quickly realised this and have found satisfying ways around this (we Swiss people are good at making compromises).

In the last 3 year things changed though.

We both work as primary teachers (yes, I know, I don't want to be around people all the time, yet I work as a teacher...can't really explain this) at the same school and her dream always was to do a sabbatical and go away for a year with me.

3 years ago we told this to the headmaster and told him, but sooner or later we wanna have a ""time-out"" and go on unpaid vacation for about 3 months and he seemed positive and supportive about it.

We searched high and low for our replacements, made plannings, bought tickets and paid hotels for our rooms. And every gooddamn time the principal ensured us, everything would be okay.

Then last summer happened. 

In my GF's class (12/13 year old) was a group of 5 girls we just called ""them bitches"" because they were a nasty bunch and bullied a girl into the ground because their families had a feud with the victim's family for years (and worse, they were even encouraged by their parents). My GF did what teachers do and stood up for the bully victim because, you know, 5 or more versus 1. The parents did not like that one bit and started an anti-campaign against her and wrote a five-page-letter to the principal on what she apparently did ""wrong"" during these 2 years she had the class. Many things were ridiculous and so stupid or stuff that was so long back, it technically couldn't matter anymore. Plus: One week after the letter the class would be leaving primary school and they wouldn't see her ever again, but assholes gotta be assholes.

The principal got the letter and ignored it. Not in the ""thank you for your letter, I will look into it""-way, but completely ignored it. Not even answered that he got it. Three times they sent the letter and got completely ignored. Understandable they went one step higher to the ""Geschäftsleitung Schule"" which is the guy who is responsible for multiple schools in the same district - almost like a CEO.
He ignored them as well in the very same way, not even answering (he does that all the time to the teachers as well...)

Now, I hate those families with a burning passion, but I do understand that after being ignored for months they went to the ""Schulpflege"", which is kind of like the board of education in our region. Basically they are the guys who decide the important things for school, are responsible for hiring teachers and make the big decision like budget and thing. They of course asked why the hell they were ignored and what was going on.

It could have been so easy. It could have been so goddamn easy. The only thing the Principal and the CEO had to say was: ""Sorry, we were overwhelmed with work, our bad. We will look into it.""
But no, they had to throw my GF under the bus and put her on a pedestal in a bad way and force her to get a work coach (yeah, according to our contract you can do this...) combined with a LUDICROUS amount of extra-work (difficult to explain if you are not a teacher) which almost drove her into burn-out and depression just to distract from the fact that they screwed up. They did the same thing to multiple other teachers, the tactic of "". Yes, I know, I am biased and I have to state, that I am completely unable to be unbiased at this point, because of my GF.

In the same meeting the forced her to accept this (in hindsight we should have quit on the spot) they also told her that my unpaid vacation was being granted whilst hers was being denied because it would have ""interfered with her work coach"". Mind you that our vacation was due in 4 months.

So apparently our boss lied to us the whole time when we asked him for a whole year if our vacation was okay and he just sat on his ass did nothing because he couldn't be arsed. Of course we were so stupid to have no written conversation about this because we trusted him.

So we had to cancel everything, lost several thousand franks because of this and to top it all off now we have lodgers in our appartement who were supposed to stay there from last june to july of this year to look after our cats while we are gone. They also owe me, at the time of writing, about 7200 swiss franks. Lodgers' rights in Switzerland are ridicoulously unfair for landlords and it is basically nigh to impossible to throw someone out of the appartement even if they owe you money (I'm serious. You can as a hobo just walk into an uninhabited building, do drugs and shit and there are still laws that prohibit the police on dragging you out).
This means that we have a family of four non-paying indians in our home we can't get rid of and we fear that they will just stay when the contract has ended in July. It's a beautiful appartement and we will not leave because of them, I will and cannot do that.

My mental health has deteriorated in the last 2 years because of the constant stress, planning and dissappointment. I feel constantly on edge because there are people in my home - our home - which don't go away. My GF and I have quit our job and will leave in summer. This is also a huge loss for me, because I though at the very same school I went to in my home town and have very fond memory of. Now this memory has been tainted.

I feel the stress everywhere: I don't really want sex anymore - not because of her, she is the same goddess when I met her - but I simply don't have the energy for it. I coerce myself into sleeping with her and take a really long time to get into it.

I have no energy left for anything. I just want to be in peace, be left alone for 2-3 months and only talk to people when I have to. More and more smaller things get on my nerves: The way a particular student talks, the fact when a door is left open, the moment when I cannot get just 20 minutes of peace in recess, the fact that I have to meet strangers and converse with them for two hours...everything mundane takes its toll from me and leaves me without any energy for my most important thing: My relation to my girlfriend.

Next august is a big question mark. She wants to go away for a whole year and - of course - go with me. I can't, I simply can't. I get panic attacks even thinking about doing this. Why? Because there will be no security. The flat will be filled with the stupid lodgers, potentially, we would be without a salary for a year and my flat costs 2000 Swiss francs per month. Nothing would be secured, noone would be really looking after our cats (which mean the world to me for reasons only pet owners can understand) and we'd potentially be in big debt coming back.

After 3 years of anxious glooming and dreading I just want to have a year of certainty. The problem is not finding a job, there are way too few teachers everywhere. I just want a year in which I go to work and in my freetime I can go after my hobbies in peace and go out with my love. I simply couldn't stand another year of this ""what-if-and-what-will"". I know it would destroy me.

But on the other side I have to stay loyal to my GF. She wanted to do this since she was 18. I want to support her, I want to be by her side, I want to stay with her and enjoy life, but although it'd mean the world to her, I have this blockade in me and can't just ""go away"" for a year. 

My parents have argued with eachother for as long as I knew. Although never violently, everyday our house had this toxic atmosphere and resentment towards eachother, mainly because of things that happened way early in their relationship at times when - in the eyes of the other - they didn't stand loyal and didn't support the other.

This is the biggest fear I have, that it will break us. We have discussed this: Maybe I'll stay in switzerland and work and visit her during my holidays, maybe I'll come with her, but neither is ""good"" for the other.

The point where definitive decisions have to be made crawl closer and closer and my anxiety grows everyday.

Please give me your advice.

I don't know what I want to do in life or what drives me. Right now what I like is my job and some things I get to do there (there are some boring stuff of course).

I've tried different things, like reading an evening course at uni. I wasn't too fond of it so stopped halfway through but I felt good for at least trying it. 

I've tried some programming khanacademy (javascript). I think it was a great way to learn coding and I thought it was fun but I don't feel the same drive I felt when I started it out. 

I tried to read some higher maths from what I read when I studied in HS and reached proofs which I had real hard time and which got me unmotivated. 

I am trying, but I can't find anything I like. I have an agenda in trying to find an intresse and that is to maybe do something with it in university.

I can't remember what happened before or during the impact but I remember waking up on the road and seeing all the debris from the crash. I saw that another driver was helping my friends out of the car so I ran over to help him and I saw my friend who was driving completely decapitated and my other friends were both unconscious. The ambulance came and I woke up in the hospital on Tuesday. The other driver was a single dad with 4 kids and from what I was told he wanted to kill himself and  drove directly into us the truck went straight through our windshield and I was luckily sitting in the back left seat which was least damaged. My other 2 friends also died I'm not sure how. I keep dreaming of the crash and I remember walking up to our car and letting my other friend drive instead of me. If I was driving maybe I would have stopped it? Maybe I would've went down a different road? I'm not sure and I can't seem to shake the guilt I have. The community has paid for their funerals next week and I'm not sure if I can bring myself to go. I haven't told anyone yet and I have no friends or family to visit me in hospital so I feel very lonely. Sometimes during the day I imagine myself jumping out of the window. I already have social anxiety so it makes it difficult to tell the doctors and nurses how I'm feeling. I'm unsure about what to do.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 20, had a horrible 4 years, got on meds and turned my life around and got my nursing degree. I've accomplished a ton in the past few years, largely thanks to the coping skills I learned battling bipolar disorder. At 27 I now have a great job at a hospital and have the financial foothold to do alot in life, but I can't decide.

Doctor: I've thought alot about this path. If I go down this road all my experiences as a nurse will give me a huge leg up in medical school and residency. I like the idea of totally giving myself to medicine and of being an expert in the field.

CRNA (certified nurse anesthetist): I'm already partially headed down this road by starting an online RN-BSN program. After this one year BSN program I'll be able to take an intensive 3 year course to become a CRNA. CRNA's make close to doctor money and they have great job satisfaction. However you're very limited as a CRNA to working in an operating room, and you don't get nearly the level of knowledge you would get as a doctor. This is the easiest, most financially responsible route, but also the least fulfilling.

Mathematician: In the past few years I fell in love with math. I always loved physics, which is what got me interested in math. Soon my interest in math totally eclipsed my interest in physics and learning about it is one of my favorite pastimes. It would be awesome to pursue math, however its completely unrelated to healthcare and I'm afraid it would only hurt my healthcare performance.

I really liked her and still do. However I started to develop a mild sexual interest in her that grew stronger... 

I knew she didn’t want anything romantic/sexual. I also wasn’t sure if I actually want it myself, just that I felt too much like I wanted it.

I thought I could stay friends with her despite that but I couldn’t and I got almost obsessed over it. So I decided I need to get away from her.

Retrospectively I regret the way I did it. I just stopped sitting by her  at class or talking to her out of my own initiative etc’. 

At the time I though it was best for both of us. Now I know that she actually was really hurt from this (from things her friends said and some suggestive comments from her). Also, I kinda miss her as a friend. 

I didn’t see her in 2 months because school is over and we didn’t really talk anymore when it happened. And I really want to somehow repair the relationship.

I’m afraid though that the same thing will happen, that I will slowly redevelop that crush on her (right now I don’t feel anything in that way, just that I miss her). 

So, is redeveloping teen age crushes a thing? Should I be worried? And if not, how can I say that I’m sorry for something I’d do again? And do you think she can go back to being friends?

So here's the thing, I got into a relationship with this guy who was calm, tolerant, mature etc last year. I am 21 and he is 31...He was a very calm person last year and would respect people of different race however, he had some problems and now he has turned into a racist person with extreme anger issues with extremely low tolerance. 
If I just happened to be standing in his way, for example, I am standing next to the tv and he has to walk past me, he gets so angry and is like moovvee!!! Also he is a fast driver so when we go out and some car is in front of him, he gets so angry and screams ""MOVE YOU FUCKING MORON!"" even though some of them are on the actual speed limit.
If we go somewhere, lets say a pizza hut in a mall, and the person taking out order tells him oh sorry we don't have that particular thing, he gets so annoyed at the person and makes angry faces at them. Like come on! Its not their fault that they don't have it wtf! they are just responsible for taking orders.. and he flips out on them by saying ""YOU DONT EVEN HAVE THE BASICS!"" and just walks away. Similarly, this one time we went to a bar and he asked the person working there if they have live music and the guy was like no we don't have them here and then my boyfriend was like ""You do last time I came u had them here"" and the guy was like idk sir but we don't have them. And my boyfriend got annoyed and said ""So you don't have them today?"" and he replied ""No"" and my boyfriend just stormed out of the bar. When I talked to him about this he said ""He was making me out as a dumb person. I have been there before I know they have it and he was like no! I felt like saying to him I am probably more educated than you""
This is not true. The guy at the bar probably was new and was told that they have no live music nights there. There is no reason to flip out on someone like that. This is also why I am scared of introducing him to my friends at times, because he has zero tolerance and may end up saying some shit.
what really upset me was when he flipped out on my dad a little. Family is important to me. I would never even think about being horrible to his mom.
This one time he came to stay with my parents for three days. His flight back was at 9 am but my father thought it was 5 am and he insisted to drop him off at the airport, my dad thought it was 7 am so he came and woke him up at 5:30 am and instead of just telling him nicely that he has time, he just said in an anger tone ""Its 5 am! What are you doing I am going back to sleep!"" and that really pissed me off and made me sad. Even though I didn't talk to him about it. 
I have no problem with him flipping out on people who are rude to him but he does it to people aren't clear with their message. Like we like in a foreign country, people speak a different language here so its understandable if sometimes they struggle to explain something in English.. And if he isn't able to understand them he flips out.. Instead of just saying ""Sorry, come again?"" 
The good things about him is that he is willing to always be there for me and if I have any issue, he would call me up and talk with me about it for hours. I am a student so sometimes I cant really afford going to places with him but he pays for me always and never lets me spend anything on him. Since I recently moved out, I am still learning stuff like ironing and washing. But when I go to meet him, he always tells me to hand in my clothes and he would do it for me. He even makes food for me whenever I come to visit and if I have any issue at all with university or anything. he is always there to help me out.

so my brother is 23, he is disabled. he has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and some other mental and physical issues due to a stroke he had as a baby. the beginning of his life was very unlucky. he didn’t walk or talk until he was 4 years old. my mum and i are very protective of him and just want him to be happy as often as he can as he’s a *very* emotional young man. 

he met his girlfriend while he was in high school. he couldn’t stand her. she was loud and terrible but she hung off him constantly. once he graduated he found himself quite lonely and this girl was just sort of there and really, really wanted to date him so he just kind of thought she’ll do and they got together.

as a protective order sister i never liked her. she was bossy and manipulative from day one and as much as i mentioned it i was just shut down. then after one month they got engaged. my brother didn’t want to do all of that so fast but his girlfriend wanted it and he didn’t want to be lonely again so he agreed and then they were engaged! 

not long after that i found out she tried to get her ex to propose after 3 days of the relationship. it was weird in my opinion but my family just kept telling me that they were special needs kids and it was no biggie. 

they fight a lot. my brother has never been able to deal with fighting he panics, stutters his words and gets extremely upset over even the smallest of fights. 

they’ve been together for about a year and a half now and things have just gotten worse. the fiancée had a massive argument with my parents because fiancée said her living situation was unsafe because of her housemate who lived in a trailer in their back yard. my parents told her to move back in with them and she started screaming that my parents weren’t her family and that she would never live with them. my parents were hurt because they are extremely family oriented. it turned into a massive huge argument with lots of yelling and crying. turns out her situation was not unsafe, she just wanted drama.

my brother has questioned his relationship a lot since then. he won’t leave her because he’s scared he’ll be alone forever. he thinks no one else will ever want him because of his physical disabilities. 

fast forward to now and my brother is somehow living with his fiancée and her ex boyfriend. i have no flipping idea how that happened but fiancée has never fully ever gotten over her ex. i’m unsure if it’s the same ex that she tried to get to propose but either way, i find is very strange that my brother is living with his fiancée and her ex. 

this week my brother was told by his fiancée to go back to my parents house for two weeks. from what i know she hasn’t given him a proper reason why and my brother isn’t exactly happy about it because when i mentioned it he got very defensive and grumpy. 

i think she’s trying to get rid of him so she can have some time with her ex and i’m 90% sure she’s going to cheat on my brother. she’s been caught talking cheeky to guys before but my brother never did anything about it.

my parents and i have tried to tell him just to move home and leave her. he’s put on a ridiculous amount of weight lately due to stress and a lack of care for himself and i hate seeing him this way.

i just want him to be happy. i just don’t know the correct angle to tackle this from. i want to speak to him while he’s at my parents house for the two weeks and maybe try to convince him that it’s okay to be alone but every time i bring it up he gets angry. 

i’m just not sure how to go about it so any advice would be appreciated...

I don't want to offend those who have actually been victims of it. But I can't help to feel like I was *somehow* raped in a sense. I know I wasn't, but inside I feel like it. My first time having sex traumatized me and I can't let it go. It was years ago but I think about it all the time. I regret it so much. 

I was 16. He was 18. I had literally never done anything with a guy before, not even kissed or held hands. I wish he would've taken it more slowly. He was my boyfriend of 2 years, we met online and he traveled to visit me. Everything was fine and happy until he kissed me. We were in some kind of secluded forest area. He carried me and lifted me up and put me down on the ground. And then he like hovered over me to ""give me a massage"" I felt really scared and hated it. 

So the next day I was going to pick him up outside of his hotel. I also wanted to tell him that I thought we should take things more slowly. He said we should talk about it inside his hotel room instead so he told me to follow him there. I was so scared and devastated, I'd been crying all night doubting our relationship and if I really wanted to be with him. Once I'm his hotel room, j completely broke down. I was crying and hyperventilating and telling him we should be friends and not do this. 

I was a mess. He put me on his bed and in his lap and said he was gonna heal me from my sorrow and then he began touching me. I should have stopped him. But instead I said yes. He was so sad. I didn't want to hurt him, so I said yes to having sex out of guilt. I wasn't in the right state of mind, I had stopped crying but I was numb. My eyes were closed or half closed the whole time, I didn't dare open them. It hurt so fucking much. I told him over and over ""ow ow ow"" it hurts it hurts it hurts, and squirmed so he'd stop doing it so roughly. He didn't use a condom, nothing was planned, he called me a wh*** and hit my face and I


It's so frustrating because I can't find solace or solidarity in being a rape victim because I'm not one, but I can't get over the regret either and I feel so worthless and awful. How can I heal from this?

I have little evidence of it apart from pictures I’ve taken of his phone with some of the less explicit photos on the screen and that my best friend was with me when I discovered them (I don’t want to be sharing or keeping photos of this nature so I didn’t feel comfortable doing anything with the other images). By the time I woke up the next day he had deleted everything except some of the less explicit ones. 
I took what I knew to his friends and they have vowed to stick by him and help him (he also has a porn addiction). However he’s not being truthful to his friends because he’s a pathological liar and he’d rather pretend than actually do the work it would require for him to get better. 
Whilst he tells his friends he’s stopped the porn, reckless dating and is using a brick phone when he’s actually been going on dates with women who DONT KNOW what he’s capable of and looking up jailbait porn. He knows he can’t get away with looking at actual illegal stuff for now (I have no doubt in my mind that he will resume it when things have settled because he has no real remorse or intention of getting better) so he’s substituting it with going on dates with girls who are 18 but look young or just women who are younger than him in general because they’re less likely to want something long term. 
This arrangement would be less creepy if I didn’t know what I know...  he’s also looking up of age girls on Instagram but who look about 14 and have that prepubescent type of body that I know he likes. 
Anyway I know we’ve broken up and it’s not my responsibility anymore but I feel a sense of guilt towards the girls who will get involved with him and don’t know what he’s done? I also feel incredibly angry that even after his disgusting secret has come to light, that it’s not even shifted him slightly towards getting the right help.
What can I do with the information that I have? Or if I can’t do anything to stop him, how can I stop worrying myself sick about the things he’s doing? Pleaseeeee help :(

Edit: Please also note that before this he had done a series of questionable things already, that his friends were aware of and I only found out a year after being together. Including dating and having very rough violent (though technically consensual) sex with a 16 year old whilst he was 23.

We had our first baby 15 months ago and since we announced we were at the hospital in labour, things changed. She texted us constantly. Then when she was born, she wanted to be here to see the little one constantly. I try to remind myself that everything she does come from a place of love, but I just cant stand to be around her. If we dont text her back, she worries something has happened to us or our little girl. 

I love my partner and our little girl and our little family time so much and I hate spending precious family time on weekends with her. My partner would never admit it but it makes him super anxious and hes a different person around her.

My mother (59F) has always been an exceptionally difficult person. Her own mother killed herself in front of her when she was 10 and she never really got the necessary mental health treatment that she needed to get over it. She always has self-medicated with food, drugs, alcohol, and more recently cutting.

She is exceptionally overweight, has nearly out of control diabetes. Around 10 years ago she stopped working entirely, has no friends, and barely leaves the house. 

No, I haven't been to the house to see her in 9 months, which she hangs over my head. She has managed in fits of rage, to say some pretty nasty things about my husband (32M), since he earns less money than I do and was trying to convince me that as soon as he didn't need me anymore financially that he would leave me. He now refuses to go to her house. We live in opposite ends of the same city (NYC, I am in Queens, she is on Staten Island). I do not drive. It would take around 2 hours each way to see them.

Oh and I work 3 jobs, around 68 hours a week. I work 7 days a week. My husband recently needed to have an emergency medical procedure that came with some fairly hefty bills.

So no, I haven't been able to carve out the time to see her. To sit in the dusty house and not do anything because her health is so bad she can't even walk for 15 minutes.

Oh, and on top of all this, she claims domestic abuse from my stepfather. That he has thrown her against a wall/down stairs. She had a broken leg and a broken shoulder 2 years ago from this. 

My half-brother as well has had violent tendencies towards her. While my method of dealing with her rage and anger was to move out. 

My mother refuses to ever get the police involved (except for one notable incident where she tried to trip the police officer and she ended up getting taken to a hospital against her will, to which she screamed and argued to get the patient advocate until they called a cab and let her out).

I received a phone call from her on Saturday evening, close to 11pm where she said she started cutting herself, that she had a terrible day out with my stepfather and she has no one to talk to. I asked how bad it was and did she need to go to the hospital. She said ""it's bad"".

I called my brother, I figured maybe he could talk to his father (my stepfather and I are not close) to make sure she is checked up on. My stepfather was asleep and no answering his phone.

My mom then got super angry at me, that I had ""dared"" to call my brother and that it was embarrassing.

I said that I am not equipped to handle cutting or this sort of situation and she needs to get some professional mental health treatment.

I don't know what to do any more. 

I don't know how to be ""a good daughter"". The aggressive ""you're a piece of shit, you never see me"" emails and voice mails don't help.

I'm posting here because I don't know where else to go, and since everyone I know irl has their biases and try to steer me in a direction that benefits them. 

So, with that said, I'll try to keep this as short as possible: 

I moved states at the end of January this year, and left college for a break since I was emotionally and physically drained (Just turned 20 a few months ago). I planned to be back in classes by now, but I'm not. Which is fine, but not ideal. I want to enroll in classes for the spring, but I don't know if I should because of a few different factors, one being that... I don't exactly like it here. I'm fine with the town that I live in, but the housing situation is my biggest issue. I'm currently living with my boyfriend and his parents. His parents are assholes who constantly berate him and make him miserable. I want to move out because of that because I think he won't grow if he doesn't get away from them. He wants to move out but even hinting at it makes him anxious. 

There's two options (in my opinion), that I can make to see where I can end up being academically/in my life. 

1. Move back to my hometown with him, where we'd live in an entirely different floor than my family/have our own space. 
2. Stay here, get a full-time job so that we can afford an apartment and live by ourselves. 

The biggest issue there is with moving back to my hometown has to do with my boyfriend. He's scared because he doesn't know what he'll do job-wise. Which upsets me since I moved here, and ended up being fine and got a job a few weeks after settling in. I'm not concerned about him getting a job since I'm guaranteed a job when/if we move there. We'll be fine since we'll be with my family so we won't ever go without food, etc, and I'll be paying my family so we won't be a burden on them. 

The issue with staying here is, as previously stated, are his parents. Along with that, if I get a full-time job I won't be able to visit my family as often as I do (I go at least for 4 days monthly, for birthdays, etc). I don't know if that's something I want to give up, since I love visiting, and seeing my family. 

What's the most rational thing/the option that makes the most sense? Is there any other ideas that you guys might have?

I typically get home around midnight from work in an area known for its crime and the amount of homeless people around. When my boyfriend and I first moved to the location about a year ago, it wasn't too much of an issue for us because we both come from similar areas.

I park my car about 2 blocks away in a parking garage because my boyfriend has to park in the apartment spot next to our building since his car is now more expensive than mine and it's low riding so it scrapes if he tries to park in the other garage. I don't feel comfortable with this because, again, i get home around midnight and i don't feel safe walking alone. I've asked my boyfriend to meet me at the garage to walk me but he's usually asleep by 1030.

Nothing's happened aside from the usual catcalling from drunks (we live next to a few bars) but nothing too alarming until the other night.

My front key doesn't work so I have to use the back side door once i get through the gate. While walking towards the side of the building, i crossed paths with a homeless guy around my age who i see hang out in my basement sometimes. A few local homeless guys in the same age group will go into our basement/laundry room to hang out and drink. They don't bother anyone so we never thought it was a problem.

We say hi to each other and i let him walk in front of me, about 15 feet ahead. By the time I get to the door he's holding it open for me. I say thank you and walk through. from behind i hear ""you're welcome, Bibi"" (my name).

I've never told him my name nor have i ever had a conversation with him outside the occasional ""hello""

i kept walking towards the basement doorway into the building and i hear ""hey come here"" i turn around and he's standing by the door motioning for me to come closer to him. I said no and turned back around towards the door and he turns the lights off. I get scared so i walk faster and get to the hallway. I turn around and he's right there. again he says ""come here"" and i say loudly NO I'm not going anywhere with you.

I run upstairs, make sure he stopped following me and get into my unit.

I call my boyfriend who was parking the car right away. He doesn't answer (he hates talking on the phone) so I text him what happened in one sentence. He immediately replies back with ""wym"" I tell him i'm scared and the guy knew my name. again he says ""wym"" and i ask him to call me; he texts back ""whats up?""

I'm shaking by the time he walks through the door. I go to him and im trying not to cry because i know he hates that. And tell him again what happened.

He asks if the guy touched me. i said no but that was because i got away - ""why didn't you answer your phone?"" i asked. He then said ""well i dont know what you expect me to do about it"".

I then start crying because for me, it was really scary. A guy doesn't turn off the lights when he's alone in a basement with a woman for good intentions. I ask him if he could talk to the guy and make sure he doesn't bother me again. My BF says that the guy's probably gone (it had only been about 5 minutes ago) and my bf's not gonna go down there and look for him.

I didnt want to put my boyfriend in danger by sending him down there so i didnt want to push it but this is the same bf who a week ago was willing to drive 2 hours away to fight someone who was talking shit about his car online.

so i got upset and mentioned that and asked why he was acting so non chalant and it seemed like he didnt care. he got annoyed and defensive and said ""no one said they didnt care you're just being emotional for no reason. stop crying you're almost 30 you're all over the place and i really don't know why you'd call me or what you expect me to do. if youre really scared just call the police""

so i walked away and called the police while i heard him turn the TV on.

I tried to ask him after I got off the phone and the day after why he didn't care more about this and why he didnt do anything and all i got in response was an eye roll and ""idk idk idk, what is it that you want from this conversation""

am i in the wrong? was i overreacting since the homeless guy didn't actually touch me? is it wrong to have expected my boyfriend to do something about? How can I get him to understand why this is so upsetting to me, both the situation and his reaction? Is it worth breaking up over after almost 3 years together?

TL;DR: homeless guy knew my name and tried to corner me in my apartment building's basement in the dark.

Hey guys, this just happened and I just need to know if I fucked up.
So, I was part of a group of friends who lived away from me, we met each other actually but nowadays we were just virtual friends.
Fast forward to the day one of this friends (he is not so close to the other people of the group, just me and another girl), who lives far away from me, tried to commit suicide and posted it on our group. 
His other close friend and I freaked out and tried everything we could to save him, even if he lives really far from us. We messaged his boyfriend, cousins, friends who lived in the same city as he, called everyone, etc. We even got one person there to call 911 and they got there in time thankfully.
The point is: while this was happening everyone on that group just did nothing or just sent one (literally) text asking him if he was ok, they literally just visualized the messages and didn’t say anything, when they actually said something it was like “oh you gotta call 911” you know? I don’t know how to explain because I’m pissed right now and my English isn’t the best.
After he was better I kept calling him everyday (still do), helped him with some money (which I never asked them to do), oriented him towards searching professional help, everything I could do from far away I did or at least everything that got through my head.
The day after it all happened I was so angry with them that I argued with one of them over their apathy and he said they did everything they could as well and that those messages from my friend were triggers for their own mental health issues (which made me angrier because I have bipolar disorder and was heavily depressed the time it happened). They said they were not close to him so they couldn’t do anything else (I personally think this is a huge bullshit) and such.
Now they are pissed at me, I deleted their contacts on my phone and all that stuff, the guy I argued with told them I said it was their fault my friend tried to kill himself (I didn’t) and I’m having an anxiety crisis thinking that he lied to them and they believed.

Context: I just graduated from a top ten university with distinction, and landed a full-time teaching gig at one of the most elite high schools in the nation. I plan on attending medical school, some form of grad school for sure, and am therefore saving money like there's no tomorrow. 

I walked into this fast food place and saw they were hiring. Asked for an application. After hearing about my background, the hiring manager seemed genuinely baffled, asking why I would want to work there. I was caught off guard, I blurted out the truth: I need money for grad school! This seemed to satisfy her, and I got the job :) 

After telling one of my friends, however, he seemed genuinely concerned, saying there are much ""better"" ways for me to make the money that ""make more sense."" 

That hurt my feelings-I wanted to share what I felt like was a huge success with my friends. I had found a place that was willing to let me work part-time, around my full-time schedule, with weekends off. What more could I ask for? Sure, the uniforms are tacky, but what fast-food place's uniforms aren't? 

He made the point that my second job is literally two minutes walking distance from my first one (which is why I picked it) and wouldn't I be embarrassed if my coworkers saw me working there? 

Now I'm second-thinking things and more than a little confused. My parents are immigrants, my dad is now a respected physician, but things weren't always that way. He had to work fast food jobs himself to make ends meet, and didn't have a car, so his boss would have to pick him up for shifts sometimes. We used to make a game over who could pick up the most change off the floor at the grocery store. 

Basically, I've never, ever seen an honest dollar as something to be ashamed of. But now I'm worried. Are my coworkers going to think differently of me? Am I jeopardizing my first really, really great job that I'm passionate about and SO lucky to have landed? Why is everyone acting like this is such a big deal??

I think I was very much infatuated by who she used to be about 2 years ago when we first met, but now? I just find her annoying and I don’t think it’s bad, I just don’t think we’re compatible. 

When we first met and started dating everything was great. Our personalities seem to work well with each other. We got along instantly after meeting. We were interested in similar things. 

But I feel like I should’ve tried being friends for a bit longer before we started dating. I think we’re just very different people who spend time with very different crowds. She’s a very “tumblr-y” person in her attitudes and interests and the way she speaks and how her sense of humour works and such. And none of those things are wrong, it’s just things that after a while gets on my nerves. Most of my friends are sarcastic, chill. I’m friends with a bunch of athletes and more extroverted party-going people. She’s friends with more internet-dwelling introverted people, theatre kids, kids with multi color hairs. sorry if I’m dwelling to much on stereotypes, but at least in our circles the stereotypes are very true. A lot of her friends do really fit the mold. And both her and I have tried to introduce each other to our own friends and while I’ve been able to get along with them perfectly fine and even consider some of them friends of my own, she just doesn’t get how to socialize with extroverted, very outgoing people. 

And again, there’s nothing wrong with any of that. Whatever interests and personality makes you happy, fucking go ahead for it. I have friends that are exactly like what I described, it’s just that I don’t mesh as closely with them as I mesh with others. 

And my girlfriend has become more and more like that. A year ago I started finding out that I might be bisexual. I told her and she was super supportive. A few months ago she told me that perhaps she was feeling the same way. I reacted just as supportive and we both know that we won’t cheat or feel frustrated by being in a hetero relationship while being bi. We communicate a lot about these things.

But anyways, she started dwelling more and more into LGBT tumblr pages and memes and stuff and frankly, the general attitude of the tumblr crowds and memes are very supportive and bubbly or super self deprecating. And she’s becoming more and more like that. It’s hard to describe what that general sassy queer tumblr attitude is like but if you’ve ever been on twitter or tumblr you know what I mean. 


In any case, if that’s your personality then That is fine! It’s just that it’s not my crowd and vibe and the more time goes on the more I think that maybe we would both be better off with partners that we were more compatible with. 

Like texting is a big thing for me. With my friends, male or female, I joke a lot. We all joke back and forth and we build jokes on top of jokes and keep going and and are sarcastic and have this general attitude that she doesn’t have. She will unknowingly often cut conversations by replying with simple one word replies because she doesn’t joke back a lot with her friends in the same way I do with my friends. Or her sense of humor is very “tumblr” or very “haha I’m Gen Z YEET” and it’s very unlike mine. 

I want to date my best friend and I just don’t think my girl and I are that anymore. And she’s seemingly really in love with me but I keep finding her personality more and more annoying. Ugh

I'm Asian American 26F, and when people see me, they think I'm a foreigner. Maybe people think they can pick on me because I'm soft spoken and nice, but I want to learn to stand up for myself and not let their negativity affect me. 

I've been made fun of, stereotyped, and treated like a foreigner all my life. So it's a sensitive issue for me. I accept that this is something I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life. But I want to learn to handle it better. When I'm in public and am harassed with racist comments, I've always tended to react. I'd yell at the person, call them an asshole, or tell them to fuck off. I'd get angry, which is probably what they wanted, and it would ruin my day. Basically I've had people stay stuff like, ""ni hao, konnichiwa, hello China"" for no reason! &amp; then people always ask me about where I'm from, no, where am I REALLY from. It's sickening.

I'm a nurse at a hospital, and deal with racist comments from patients and coworkers (even other nurses!). So basically, I've handled these comments calmly, but I felt like they got away with treating me like that. Like I really wanted to put them in their place but didn't know how to do so calmly so I just answered their annoying, persistent questions about my cultural heritage. When I try to tell people I'm an American, it's like they won't believe me and keep trying to ask questions about my culture as if I'm of a different species or something.

If not, please point me in the right direction. I didn’t know where else to go to ask about this. Please bare with me here, I know this is going to be hard to follow because I don’t know exactly how to word this so that somebody on here will understand what I’m saying. I’m only 24 and I don’t really have any experience dealing with banks and certainly don’t have experience dealing with something like this. 

To begin, my grandmother, who is literally the sweetest most kind hearted woman in the world, appears to be in a serious situation right now. She has been talking to this person online for the last 6 months apparently. It started out on Facebook, a man who is going by the name “James Henninger” added her as a friend and  struck up a conversation with her. Before long it moves from Facebook to texting her phone and then to google hangouts (which I’ve heard is notorious for being used by scammers). 

She has apparently been sending him money here and there, started out as just sending amazon gift cards to him at some address in New York. The guy told her that he is stationed in Syria and gave her a whole sob story about how his platoon was bombed and he lost all of his personal belongings and had no way to access his money. He asked her to open up a bank account with SunTrust and send him money through that. He also had a box of checks sent to her home. I don’t know every detail because she is obviously not being 100% transparent with us about it because she is embarrassed that she has fallen for this. I’m not sure if he has access to the account or what, but I’m assuming he does since he is getting the money somehow. Like I said she isn’t being completely honest with us about the whole thing so I can’t give as many details as I would like. 

Anyway, my mother got a call yesterday from a man who was trying to get in touch with my grandmother. He said he was with the corporate security department of Regions Bank (which is apparently the parent bank of SunTrust I think? I’m not completely sure) saying that he needed to speak to her about checks that had been deposited that were not hers. She called him back and he told her that one of their clients has had $57000 taken out of his account (which was the account that checks had been deposited into, as well as her main bank and he named both SunTrust and her main bank). So apparently this scammer has gotten ahold of this other mans account and is using it to funnel money through to himself. At least that’s what I’m getting from what he said, like I said I’m not 100% sure because I didn’t talk to the guy myself. 

Long story short my grandmother may be in some serious trouble. I don’t know if this guy has her social security number or not but I do know that she has given out a TON of personal information to him. He knows every member of our immediate family by name and what we do for a living. He knows her address and what her daily routine is. He obviously has access to her SunTrust account and is using her as a scapegoat to filter money from another mans account to his, if that makes any sense. 

Once we found out about this, we told her not to let the guy know that we know it is a scam. But for some reason that I cannot understand, she immediately texted him and told him that we all knew about him and we knew he was trying to con her. She asked him if it was a scam (smh) and that he has still been talking to her, I’m sure just to try and find out what we know. 

I know this is probably hard to understand, I am very scatterbrained right now this whole thing has my head spinning and my heart racing because I am just so mad and so worried for her. She doesn’t have a lot of money and to think that some guy is trying to take advantage of her has me raging mad right now. 

Please if there is anybody who sees this and knows what kind of action we can take, let me know. Obviously we are going to take her to close all of her bank accounts on July 5 when banks open back up. Is there anybody who knows how to find this guy or get his IP based off of his google account that he is using? 

Again i apologize for this post being all over the place. My mind is a mess right now and I have major ADD so just typing all of this out in a way that is halfway coherent has been tough.

I'm going to tell a Lil bit of what the story is about and give you 2 options and a 3rd if you didn't like either option. Also my target audience is primarily highschool era and college students, especially to those who like anime and manga.

So the story (loosely) is about a hero who is set on purging the entire world of these 7 evil armies each lead by a captain and each captain lead by 1 king common ancient king who's motive is nothing more then complete destruction and dominance. He is much like the Devil I guess you could say. The main character who is almost as ancient as the evil king embark on his journey at the age of 21. (creative I know there is more of a reason as to why he does this at 21) The main character plans on building an army to oppress the king and destroy the 7 captains. There is more to this but for the sake of protecting my idea this is all I am going to share. 

Option 1): start with the very beginning: before I start with the actual story I tell the story of the past that explains why the world is the way it is and how the armies came to be. Also explains the main characters back story

Option 2): just jump right in on the action: start the story showing a citizen in distress and being attacked by monsters and when cornered the main character appears from nowhere and saves the citizen all while displaying his power. By doing this I demonstrate the strength of the main character and the power he holds. Then he goes about his day and narrates what the world's current conditions is in (the story of how the world came to this predicament is not told here but at a later point in the story.)

Option 3: neither: tell me what you think I should do to start the story instead. DO NOT suggest changing any details about what I have set in place so far (ex: remove the idea of basing number 7 because it's too overused.)

I work in a pretty relaxed environment for the most part. It's a general 9-5, but some coworkers don't stroll in until after 9:30. My manager is the only one that causes me stress in this environment, as she tends to micromanage. Everyone knows she's a lot to handle, so I get sympathy from some. An example of her behavior is when I once asked for time off to go to a funeral and she initially declined because she was taking that day off to install flooring, but after enough bitching and moaning the CEO granted my time off and my manager said that ""she wishes I would have given her more notice."" 

She's away at a work conference this week and asked if I could do something on her computer. Fine, sure, no problem. I go to open up Word and there's a document listed of the times I enter the office, when I leave, how long my lunch breaks are, and even when I take another break down to the minute (sorry I had to go take a shit for twenty minutes?) .

As much as my dad seems like the victim here, he's not. He used to have relationships with multiple women when we were young and my mother couldn't do anything because he used to beat her. The only reason she didn't leave was because of us since she had no way to support us financially.

An x Ray, several tests, and 400$ later, they sent her home with anti-nausea medication and antibiotics and said to monitor her closely for any signs of diarrhea, since that could indicate parvo.

Ok so i am a 15 year old female, and over a month ago i asked out this guy who I had a crush on for AGES. It took a lot of gut. He is in the same friendship group as me. He said he liked me too and we went out, it was REALLY good. Ever since then we’ve been on like 4 dates.  Today we went on another date and it was going really well, we decided to make things offical. Yay my first boyfriend!! The date was coming to an end and we were saying our goodbyes and I kiss him. We hadn’t kissed yet (and mind you we have been dating for a month and 2 weeks). I don’t know why I kissed him it just happened, plus we were offical so like why is it a bad thing? Anyways I kiss him without even thinking, it just happened. (My first kiss btw) but then .. he pulls away. Fuck. 
He goes “hey I really like you but I think it’s too early”. Fuck again. 
I go “how long until you want to?”.
“Like a month,” he says. 
Fuckk. I just had my first kiss with this guy I liked FOREVER, we’ve been going on dates for over a month, became offical, then he pulls away and says it’s too early.
He then says “look I really like you, but I just want to take things slow.”
Don’t get me wrong, I totally respect his decision or whatever but he’s acting like an innocent kiss is the end of the world. And a lot of my other friends have had theif first kiss, some even on the first date. And that was our 5th date. I feel like a total idiot. I made a fool out of myself. I honestly have no idea what I’m going to do. And the thing is, I’m honestly getting so bored. I’m the one who is always texting first, I’m the one who says all the cute shit. I feel like I’m the one doing all the work! Straight after the date ended I called my guy bestfriend, while in a full panic about the situation (he kissed his current gf on the first date and they have been dating for 3 months). He said that if the guy really liked me then he would’ve kissed me back or whatever and wouldn’t’ve been so weird about it.  
I’m kind of questioning if I should just end things with this guy, we’ve been going out for way too long and nothing has happened. I’m the one who does all the work. And he was super fucking weird when I kissed him. BUT then again I actually do want to get to the point when he is comfortable with kissing and stuff.

From there on, we regularly went on to grab a beer together, hung out a lot and talked about fucking everything. I was the only company and support he had at the time.

As the time went by, he met my small group of friends and therefore felt a lot more accepted, which he was. I noticed him getting happier with time and I felt so good about myself for doing this to him. There were about 4-6 of us in total, depending on the occasion and logically we went drinking all the time. It was tons of fun. The dude was hilarious when socialized.

Fast forward a year or less, I broke up with my girlfriend and was in a really bad mindset. I stopped hanging out for a while and became a lot more introverted than before. It fucked me up.

As my sister and family were recovering it came out that my fiancé had also been sexually assaulted at 14. This fucked me up, I was mad at the world for a long time. I confided in my best friend to help me through the process, and to some extent he helped. 

Now we've all recovered, but the mention of rape puts me in a foul mood and brings up the feeling of helplessness I felt so strongly two years ago. It's not that I won't talk about it, but it's not subject matter I, my sister, my family or my fiancé like to talk about. 

Now my 'best friend' brings up the subject of rape far too often as of late. He'll put on a podcast about an assault survivors story, or put on stand up conedy of Jimmy Carr that is full of rape jokes. He'll accidentally tough my fiancé on the arm and shout something like 'Don't worry, it's not like I'm a rapist, hahaha""

He's always lacked tack to some extent, but this has become unbearable. We hung out Saturday for maybe six hours and the word came out at least three times. I've confronted him about it twice, yet he continues to always mention rape.

At this point I don't even want to be around him because all he seems to think that the most traumatic thing to happen to my family and my fiance is some kind of joke, or he thinks he's helping desensitize me somehow. But in reality he just constantly ruins the mood and brings up a very sore subject at totally inappropriate times.

What do I do with the guy. He hasn't listened to me politely asking him to stop mentioning it, and it's really making me question the friendship.

I also wonder why rape seems to be on his mind so much around my fiancé...",True,False,,False,Advice,t5_2qjdm,,141260.0,public,,self,,,Best friend won't stop bringing up rape when he knows it's a sensitive subject.,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/979m9o/best_friend_wont_stop_bringing_up_rape_when_he/,all_ads,6.0

I believe in God, yes. I do want to follow his example. But I really doubt that he wants us to be divided into religions and that he doesn’t care what religion anyone is. 
The Mormon Church teaches that there’s a whole process for the afterlife. You go to either Paradise, or the Spirit Prison where you are to repent for your sins and learn about the gospel. After that there are two resurrections, one that seems to be better than the second one. And then Satan will be let go and then he’ll be locked up again. 

The Mormon Church also teaches that only members of the church go to this Paradise. That is so unfair. Since the moment that was told to me I started doubting the teachings. 

It feels confusing. It doesn’t feel good. The reason I am still in the church is because I fear what will happen in the afterlife if I leave. If you’re atheist, cut me some slack, it will seem ridiculous to you but I actually believe in an afterlife, so don’t judge or laugh at this, please. 

I would also really appreciate if you did not call this religion a cult, as true as it may seem to you I would very much appreciate it. 

My mother left the religion some time ago, and my father was very sad. He doesn’t admit it but this devastated him. He wants to avoid the same thing happening to me. My dad is very proud of me and he loves me very much, he’s always supportive of my decisions except for any that go against the church, such as not going to Mutuals or not wanting to go one day. One of his main worries is that I, one day, will leave the church. He is happier in the church and the church has helped him a lot in his life. Had he not joined the church, we probably would not be where we are now. I’m afraid of my life being completely ruined because I left the church. Because I stopped paying tithing. Because I stopped believing in some of the views that the church taught. 

So one day, I thought, what if no religions are true? What if all of them have an element of truth in them? And something just clicked... something just made sense. 

In every religion, many base their truths off of being blessed by God by praying and following the religion. 

But what if the only thing needed is to be a good person overall?

Why would homosexuality be a sin, if it’s not destructive? Sure if all were homosexual the human race would be extinct but guess what, not everyone is. In fact there’s not as much as people think. 

Why would drinking coffee be such a bad thing? It’s addictive, but the internet’s addictive too and we don’t see that being a sin. We don’t see food being a sin. Essentially anything can be addictive. 

Why, if the gospel never changes, did it change in 1978?

There’s a lot of why’s all over the place. But I’m still confused. What if we don’t know the answer and we will know it afterwards? What if it actually is Satan who’s giving me these ideas so that I’ll leave the church and ruin my life? What if I do leave the church, and my father becomes disappointed with me? What if I become more of a jerk after leaving? 

I need some advice as to what to do. I’ve prayed and waited for an answer. I’ve done everything according to what the church leaders advised and still no answer. Confusion. Fear. Desperation.

If I ask atheists, they’ll tell me to either leave the church or to just do what I feel is right. 
If I ask non mormons, I’ll be told to do what I feel is right. 
If I ask anti-mormons, I’ll be told to leave. 
If I ask mormons, I’ll be told to stay in the church and that Satan is tempting me. 

I just wish I could get a yes or a no... 

TL;DR
I want to leave the Mormon Church because I am starting to doubt a lot of it. I don’t know if what happens after will ruin me or benefit me. I fear for the future. I am very confused.

In short, my sister (youngest of 6 kids 19F) has always been spoilt. My parents never seemed to discipline her the same way we were discipline and as a result she has become entitled, awful and self-centred. It was one of those situations where she would hit and scratch and hurt you multiple times, and you would retaliate once but then get in trouble as you were meant to know better (Although apparently she has never been able to know better).

I’m the middle child (24F) and we are the only girls in the family. I’d always hoped she’d grow out of her ways and we’d become close like my friends sisters had but at this point I don’t even want a relationship with her.

When she was 16, she began self-harming. Now I suffer anxiety (quite severely) myself, so I am not one for minimising mental illness. Her self-harming appears to be attention based and used as a tool of manipulation over my parents. Whenever they would try and discipline her, she would self-harm in what appeared to be an act of defiance.

I was really on her side during this time of her life. I took her to get help, looked out for her, tried to be supportive etc. and she was looking at a road to recovery. She stopped self-harming for a few years.

Then my dad. My dad was diagnosed with cancer and it threw everything off. Shortly afterwards my sister began self-harming again. At first I thought this may be a coping mechanism to deal with the difficult time, but fresh cuts would always seem to appear as my dad was the centre of attention. My dad, on one instance, was going in for really invasive surgery and she visits the hospital, her sleeves rolled up to show off her freshly cut arms and became visibly annoyed no one was paying attention to her.

The last 2 years she has been nothing but awful to me in my attempts to be nice. I have taken her for coffee, driven her to her friends, stayed up and cried with her, held her hand when things were shit. And how does she repay me?

She has always stolen my clothes, expensive make up etc, but she has upgraded to straight up stealing money from me. And usually money I have received in a gift, or special notes of significance. Today I went to go to pay for a hair cut (I had $100 in my wallet) to have it all gone. Now I know I have not spent this money, as I had kept it specifically for this hair cut. 

When I confronted my parents about this, they simply sighed and shrugged as if to say, what can we do? 

I’m asking for advice because I truly don’t know what to do with her anymore. I have skimmed over a lot of her behaviour and our relationship but I honestly cannot stand to be around her. I know she is going through something mentally, but I don’t feel like this should be an excuse to shit all over your sister.

So as we’re walking out of the store, which is on  a fairly trafficked street, and well lit, when I look to the left and notice across the street there were three dudes who looked like they definitely weren’t there to make friends. It takes about three seconds for them to IMMEDIATELY start walking towards us (four lane street) and at a damn quick pace. 

I’m not paranoid and I’m street smart enough to know what’s up when every alarm in my head starts going off at the same time at max volume. So I instantly tell me coworkers to get to their cars as fast as they can, sprint to mine, and proceed to grab my S&amp;W MP shield 9mm with a full clip of +P hollow point ammunition and put a round in the chamber so fast it would make their heads spin.

Now my female coworker got the message and saw what was going on, so she made it to her car pretty fast, got in and left. My other coworker got in his car and turned his Brights on as he was facing their direction.  And I stand there with my pistol in my hand. And as the three get closer I see a shiny metal bar like object in the front guys hand. And as they got closer I saw that it was a knife. 

As far as I’m concerned that’s enough of a reason for me to start lining up a shot, and as I’m raising my gun and preparing to tell them to immediately back away or face the consequences, one of the guys on the side notices and instantly stops his friends and they start backing up and duck off behind some of the stores across the street. 

I informed my coworker of the extent of the situation and we both left and didn’t stop to give them the tail lights. 

I don’t regret my decisions and if it had come down to it I would have unloaded into them without hesitation or remorse. I know what I saw, and that area where I work is no stranger to crime. Not notorious for it mind you, but certainly no stranger.  

I don’t carry a gun because I want to shoot anyone. I don’t. The thought of having to make that kind of decision scares me and still does, and definitely did when I had to decide between my safety and that of my friends and coworkers, and the lives of three people. 

Did I make the right decision? I didn’t want to, but if they hadn’t stopped and if the main person had gotten any closer with a knife in his hand and two other people with him, I would have taken the shot. I was shaking when I got back in my car and I just feel angry and upset that the situation even happened. I hated the feeling of pointing a gun at someone.

I've literally never been a manager, supervisor, or even a shift supervisor before in my life. This is mostly due to moving around a lot. I'm now a co-manager at a shop. Not assistant, but equal. 

Our cleaner has always been shit. He shows up early af when he's supposed to come after close. Today he turned up and cleaned the shop 3 and a half hours early while we had customers in, fully mopping floors and everything. If the customer toilet is nasty and shit stained, he will pour bleach over it for 2 days in a row ""to soak"" and then clean it with a new mop head that he then throws away. During these two days, we have to put the only toilet out of order and listen to customers moaning about it. He constantly bitches about cleaning the toilet and bathroom and moans when I let paying customers use the toilet because ""why can't I just always keep the Out of Order sign on the door all the time?""

I get it. Nobody likes cleaning shit out of a toilet. But that's his job and he's choosing to do this work. It's part time for him and only one hour a day for 5 days a week. 

I've seen him for nearly two years and he's a nice guy. Everybody gets on with him, even the customers. My previous managers have just been bitching about his cleaning for ages, but they've never tried to actually get a new cleaner. 

Should I go for firing/replacing this guy, or just deal with it? I've only been a manager for about a month. My co-manager says he will back me up but he'd never pull the trigger himself. Probably an English thing.

How big of a dick move is this? I've never been in this position before and the moment I do, I replace somebody. Should I wait it out a bit longer? I've already tried to talk to him about how all the cleaning checks need to be achieved (mainly the customer toilet), but he only responds with how it needs to soak and he'll do it on such and such day. 

Advice?

Hey

I'm a freshman in college, and I just can't seem to shake this feeling of loneliness anymore.  It's kind of been omnipresent with me for the past year.  

I'll go over what i've gone through that caused most of this, and then I'll go over my current emotions.

In high school (third year, but graduated as a junior) I was falsely accused of sexual assault

For context, I should say that I am a MTF transsexual, and for reference I was on hormones for about a year during the first story, and a year and a half on the second.

anyways

Over the summer 2016, me (MTF/16/junior, but graduating) and my best friend (M/17/junior)(we'll call him ""Red"" because that's what color I used to block his info in the screenshots) became really close.  It was the summer that Pokemon GO came out.  We would spend hours just driving around farming pokeballs, and stay out until like 4 am.  We often had many of those 'deep as fuck parked car conversations' and i really truly cared for the guy.  It should also be known that I really had a crush on him since 6th grade as well, so yeah.  

On September 10th 2016, Red asked me if I wanted to come over to his place after a band competition, which I did.  
His girlfriend (F/18/college freshman/""Yellow"") at the time lived 2 hours away and visited every weekend.  So, he would've been feeling sexually deprived and I really didn't expect anything to happen, because he knew me before I came out and I knew that was weird for straight guys, let alone me being trans within itself, so I was looking forward to an innocent night of Battlefront.

When the clock struck 3 am, I called it quits.  I was exhausted from the comp day, and I just wanted to sleep, so I asked Red where to sleep.  
""Well, we could either crash on the couch or sleep in my bed.""

*We*? 
I thought that was a subtle bait, but I wasn't quite ready to bite yet,  I remained skeptical.  So I walked toward his bed and laid down, him following suit.  He then proceeded to lock the door, reminding me that he always does that when he goes to bed because ""his step brother likes to run into his room to wake him up with annoying toys.""

Now this is definitely a subtle invitation.  He practically just told me that no one will interrupt us.

We watched Adam Ruins Everything while laying down, and we started to slowly cuddle.  I couldn't believe it.  The guy I had a crush on for so many years, the guy I was practically in love with, is in the same bed as me!  

Our fingers makes circles on each others skin, and he eventually pulls his shorts down and forcefully shoves my head toward his crotch.  We both enjoy ourselves until the deed is done, and then he gets up, cleans himself off and the rolls over and falls asleep.  I kind of start to feel inklings of guilt for sleeping with a taken man.

The next morning, he wakes me up; my group for my German Project is hounding his phone because they knew I stayed at his house.  I get up and leave, and once I get to the group location, I start to spill the beans because Blue(F/16) and Purple(F/16) started to pry it out of me.  They jokingly shame me for doing it with someone who is dating another person.

Later that day, I message him and [this(these) conversation(s)](https://imgur.com/a/2BeX8) ensues.

The following days, Red and I are closer, but then one day, he skips school, but then a get a [message](https://imgur.com/a/orY0U) from Yellow, then Red starts [messaging me](https://imgur.com/a/kf4SV) as well.

I start to feel ganged up on right now

What I think happened, was that Red didn't want to get into hot water with Yellow, so he tucked tail and decided to fabricate what actually happened between him and me.  And he didn't want to be seen as a faggot that let a tranny suck his dick.  But the thing is that he instantly went from super close best friend to hating my guts, which was painful.  I loved the guy, and now i don't exist to him, and it just was painful. (not to discredit what Yellow is feeling, but yeah) . Also, Red and Green(M/16) become much closer friends . But to deal with the emotional pain, I start self harming and abusing drugs.

This is also where Blue and Purple start to show themselves as 'pot-stirrers' to get more drama going, which will be important later.


Red and Yellow keep on showing up my obligations.  Like they show up at marching band performances, and it's never apart, they're always together.  If your SO was raped, i don't think you would keep on showing up with him to places you know the supposed rapist would be at, would you?  

But I keep on getting super frustrated, so I make [this post](https://imgur.com/a/VVt1Z), which Yellow immediately responds to [in my DMs](https://imgur.com/a/RRRqF)
Eventually, some online rando comments ""Do you need me to kill someone?"" in a hyperbolic sense, as a form of support, but Yellow took that as a literal death threat and started telling people I had a hit out on her

A couple weeks pass, and in october, I attempt [an apology](https://imgur.com/a/jhb4n) to Red, and didn't go over so well
He blew up on me, and made me feel so awful about myself, that I attempted suicide.

So on New Years Eve, Green comes over to my house, and we play some games together, but I tried to cheat on my then-girlfriend with Green, because she lived about 3 hours away, and we only visited an hour at a time, so I didn't get any sexual relief, and Green was at my house and he was right there, so we almost did something.  He rejected during the initiation of the sexual encounter, saying that we shouldn't, alluding to me having a girlfriend.  Which then I stop,

In January 2017, I [message Purple](https://imgur.com/a/EsZaH) to ask for her advice, and she's upset with me, understandably,
This is where it's revealed that she knows about NYE
**important note**, under this context, Purple knows about NYE and seems to be under the presumption that it was consensual.

Fast forward to May 5th 2017,  We have a Pep band performance, and Green asks if I could take him home because he couldn't find his original ride, so I agree to take him home.  I see that he found his original ride, so I assumed he'd be riding with him.  
When I leave, I see Orange(F/16) leaving to walk by herself back home, which I tell her that I could take her home if she would want me to, so she gets in my car.  
Once I start to leave, Green jumps in my car will it's moving because he still wanted to come home with me, and then Orange jokingly says we should all go to Denny's, so we do lmao

We end up staying the night at our house, and he puts on a pair of my sweatpants because he was wearing kakhi pants, and we all kind of start cuddling, partially nude, while watching Netflix horror movies.  Anyone with any sort of sense could see that something would've been initiated. Which it does.  Orange and I start making out with his body and felatio is initiated, but halfway through, he jumps up and says No, so we both stop, and he gets up and walks home at like 3 am.  Orange and I are shook, and I get really upset because nothing like this happened to me before

He [messages me](https://imgur.com/a/sTnIx) the next day.

Funny thing is, all the rumors going around school have nothing to do with Orange (a cisgender female), everything is about how I violated Green, which makes this whole thing feel like a personal attack against me.  
I feel genuinely bad about myself here.  I continue abusing drugs and self harming.  I don't actively attempt suicide because graduation is coming up, but it was bittersweet because i didn't have anyone to celebrate with.  I do have multiple daily mental breakdowns.  I was even sent home from my job multiple days because I couldn't work.  I walked around school all mopey and shit so Purple and Blue start [harassing me](https://imgur.com/a/AnU8C) and started fabricating another accusation centered around the NYE encounter. Purple sees that me as playing the victim
Even though I have to eat lunch in the front office now, and literally all of my friends completely abandon me.  Hell, they even gaslit me so hard to make me believe I was genuinely a rapist.
This is where I felt true and absolute loneliness.  Everyone I knew hated me, and pretended I didn't exist.  It was truly the lowest point I have ever been, ever.

Green eventually wanted to drop it, and let me know through [a text](https://imgur.com/a/3WTdl), which I thought was very peculiar, but that didn't fix the damage to my mental health, my social life, or anything like that.  Its like my feelings were just ripped out of my chest, and I feel like I won't really truly be over it

I haven't really gone to therapy to sort any of this shit out

I'm currently in college, but I'm on academic probation because of my mental state (1.77 gpa).  I'm trying to get out of it, but I'm struggling
I'm having financial problems since my loans wont come through

I always feel alone because I don't have a roommate, so I just sit in my dorm room doing nothing a lot of the time
sometimes the feeling of complete and utter loneliness hits me at random times, like the same feeling i had when everyone i knew abandoned me after the accusations
i think its because i don't have that much of a close connection to that many people around here, up in college

I don't like hanging out in other peoples rooms because i always feel like im intruding, ergo i'm not wanted
Or if I am invited, it feels like we have to talk about or do something, like sometimes i just want company

Or since my dorm floor is very social justice-y, a lot of the time i don't feel like i can talk about my personal beliefs, or my opinions without it turning into a triggerfest since i'm a centrist

I have a couple friends on the floor, but they don't feel as close as I would like them to be
I usually feel excluded because of my personal beliefs

Sometimes I see graduates (from my HS) who still talk to those people, and it reminds me of how alone I am, and nobody wants me anymore.  I haven't had one high school person contact me since graduation

even though it was a year ago, it's still such a massive event that it's incredibly fresh in my mind

I just don't know what to do

tl;dr: old friends from high school falsely accused me of rape, which absolutely destroyed my social circle and mental health.  Now I'm in college on academic probation struggling to keep my sanity because I'm so alone, and I don't know what to do.

I just really need some advice from people who don’t know me. I’m 21 and a senior in college. If everything goes well I’m supposed to graduate in May 2020. After graduation my mother expects me to move back in with her to help her take care of my siblings and help her get a house. As far as my siblings: two are boys, aged 10 and 7 and one is my sister (18) who has severe cerebral palsy. We have to do pretty much everything for her.

Anyway, after I move back in, my mother plans on divorcing my stepdad and kicking him out.  She wants me to help her get a house by putting my name on the lease along with hers. I honestly don’t know what that means, but my therapist told me that I shouldn’t have to do this if I’m being coerced by mom mother. 

The problem is, I don’t want to move back with my mother. I have so much freedom where I currently live (with my aunt) and I just don’t want to be forced to move back. I love my siblings, but as the oldest of 4 I’ve spent a good portion of high school and my young adulthood taking care of them. During high school, my mom would work until the late evening and it was my responsibility to feed my siblings and take care of them and get them ready for school the next day. And as the big sister, I realize this is my job but I’m so tired of it. I want freedom. I feel like I missed out on so much growing up because of my siblings. And I understand this isn’t their fault, but it’s not mine either. They aren’t my kids.

My mom and I have an okay relationship but we just can’t talk about anything. No matter what the issue is, she’s right and I’m wrong. I’ve brought up my concerns in the past but it always ends up with me being called selfish. My mom has told me that since I don’t wanna help, I’m free to “exile myself from the family”.

I don’t have a problem with helping, my problem is that I’m pretty much the second mother for my family at 21 and I don’t want to be, I don’t believe this is fair. They aren’t my kids and I didn’t choose to have them. I can’t work as many hours because of my family obligations, I can’t do things with friends because of my family obligations, I feel like I can’t be an independent adult because of my family.

I really need advice. After I graduate I was going to get a full time job and save up money (by continuing to live with my aunt) and get my own place and go from there. But if I tell my mom that, she’ll just freak out and tell me why that’s a bad idea. Is it my responsibility to help out my family while also sacrificing my own sanity and happiness? I’m worried that if I tell my mom all of this, she’ll completely cut me off. Not in the monetary way since she doesn’t pay for anything, but in the family support sense.

I was always taught to treat everyone equally and that has been one of my core beliefs. 

Right now, I live in an apartment on a college campus, and there are four units on my floor (including mine). Although I don't personally know my neighbors, I noticed that there are white guys in two of the units and asian guys in the other one. 

The incident happened today. The hallway has a staircase on one end, and an elevator on the other end. My unit is closer to the stairs and further away from the elevator. Today, I got off the elevator and was walking towards my room, when I heard footsteps coming from the staircase. I didn't think much of it then, but when I got right in front of my room, an African American guy came out from the staircase (at most 10ft away). At that moment, I got so scared, opened my door as quickly as I could, and shut it behind me. I looked out at the peephole right away to see if he was still there, and I saw him minding his own business and casually walking away. (I think he just moved into one of the units.)

I felt guilty and confused. I was so blatantly offensive and I felt terrible. But I was also really confused because it was as if it was my natural instinct to act that way. At first I tried to justify myself thinking it's all because he was a stranger that I've never seen around. But as much as I want to deny it, I probably wouldn't have acted the same way if the stranger was white or Asian.

There is a sketchy black neighborhood close to where I live, but if I am truly free of prejudice, that shouldn't have affected the way I acted. I thought I never judged people by their appearance or race, but that's exactly what I did today. I started doubting all the decisions I made in life, thinking if someone's race have subconsciously clouded my judgment. I strongly believe (or at least I thought I did) in equal\-rights and participate in related student groups. But now I don't know how to feel about myself anymore, and can't help to think that I might be innately racist after all.

I am not married and have no children of my own. 

My parents marriage has never been great with lots of snide comments, passive aggressiveness and bickering between the two for the past 30+ years. I had a deeply disturbed older brother who died 2 years ago from a drug overdose after 20 years of constant arrests, accidents and stalking. 

I feel shadowed by my parents. My Mother calls or texts me daily. Every week there seems to be some holiday or family event that I am obligated to attend. 

The past few weeks, there has been a family dinner for Father's Day, my niece's birthday, July 4 and today is my brother's birthday dinner. I asked my brother if he would mind if I skipped because I have a 14 hour work day tomorrow and going to weekly family events is tough. It's about a 2 hour drive round trip with the traffic. 

He said he didn't mind and I'm sure he's telling the truth. 

My Dad is passively aggressively texting me saying: ""Can't you stop by for 5 minutes just to say Hello?"" He's a huge hypocrite because he's hardly ever home and he's always late to everything. For most family dinners he shows up 1 hour late. 

My Mother called me and said: ""How would you feel if your brother skipped your birthday???"" I said I wouldn't care one bit and my brother told me he didn't care, either. 

How can I avoid weekly family events? My Mother will be very upset if I don't go to them all. In the past she's said how lucky I am to have family and how I should go to everything.

Sister left him because she fell in love with another man. She is now single.

After their break up, D and I started to see each other regularly. And now I'm falling for him. But I never told my sister I'm seeing D on a daily basis.

There was this event going on in our town and D asked if I'd like to go with him, as friends. I felt so bad about that specification but I accepted.

I anticipated seeing acquaintances that night, and my aunt (who lives with us) had mentioned she might be going. So I let my sister know I would be going with D. Her first reaction was to say she won't allow it. I repeated that he had extended the invitation as a friend. She started to list off all the things D had done for her on their first few dates, asking if he did the same with me. I denied everything in front of her, but some things were similar. She said she thinks D is doing all this to get back at her and that he isn't really interested in me. She said she is trying to protect me.

I did my best to now show how hurt I was because I don't want my sister to know I like him. This conversation happened two days before the event. She had our aunt ditch her plus one so she can come along instead. She went out of her way to make sure she looked her best. I noticed she even wore a necklace D had gifted her. This was after she found out D had gifted me a necklace to thank me for my help.

Needless to say, that night was weird. I felt miserable about the whole thing and though D was really fun, it was so unsettling to know my sister was just around somewhere. At some point D asked me to dance. I was tipsy and bold and we were getting close. I think I was still bitter about him asking me to come along as friends or maybe I just wanted to see how he feels. But I asked him if that's how he usually dances with his friends. He said no and I just instantly locked up. I was feeling nervous, and guilty and I kept thinking about what my sister said. It didn't help that I kept worrying about her or our aunt seeing us.

I left shortly after that, and I left things between us feeling pretty weird. He kept texting me, asking me out for brunch, then lunch. I didn't reply. I was thinking about us and I decided I was stupid so this morning I left my house early so I could get us coffee and catch him on his way to work. I know his schedule pretty well so I just waited outside his place but nothing. I started to worry I might have missed him, so I sent him a text asking him if he was already at work. He replied no and asked me if I wanted to meet up with him before so I knocked at his door and, who guessed it? He had company over...

We can call her Jane. I am an empath and I really have very few meaningful relationships, so when I find one and put time/effort into said relationships I tend to have a harder time letting them go, because it's hard to find people to connect to. Jane lives close by and we live in a small town. She constantly makes me feel used by only coming over to smoke weed (that she isn't allowed to do at her house) and then immediately leaves. Example: shows up at 11pm, leaves by 12:30am and usually leaves me questioning myself, my sanity or our relationship. This happens almost nightly. She randomly comes over, sometimes uninvited and berates all my friends. One time Jane told me she thought I had schizophrenia, and then left me alone by myself for three hours. She belittles me and everyone around her, it's a complete drag; On a positive note Jane is constantly giving gifts that she has paid for and accumulated through subscriptions (she has a total of 6 different ones) she just uses as gifts. They're all super expensive, she is extremely wealthy in my small town and she always makes sure you and everyone else in the room knows it, but acts like she isn't. She is constantly rude to me. We have on and off fights usually about me talking to other people. She will get super mad and tell me who I should and shouldn't spend my time with, but then when you criticize her or who she spends her time with she cuts you off. Blocks you completely on social media... So nothing usually gets resolved. Because you're too scared to get cut off. ( life is a lot harder when she is mad at you) so I guess what I'm asking is how can it be a clean break? She does really toxic things like tell people lies about you and talk straight mad shit about you to those who's opinions matter to you and then they get upset with you and it is super messy and toxic. I feel like I'm drowning in her web of negativity... She always wants to show you stuff but shits on everything you recommend / tell her you enjoy. But Jane didn't used to be like this, we've been friends for 8 years now. She used to be very nice to talk to.

Senior year of high school, my first choice flat out rejected me. I never bothered even attempting to appeal the decision, because airheaded seventeen year old me thought biochemistry was my passion, and the only reason I had to appeal was change of major... One school term in at my second-choice university, I realized I only enjoyed theory and hated doing labs and I immediately switched into math.

Maybe it's because I'm in a weird part of my life in which I moved out of my college apartment and moved back in with my parents. I have a job lined up but I'm currently not working because I'm constantly ""on-call""... So essentially I have way too much time on my hands to think about stuff like this. But many times I genuinely wonder what would have happened had I appealed the decision senior year of high school... Or if I had just dropped out of the university I was attending after my first or second year and just went to community college instead (in which I probably would have really found out I really should have taken computer science or computer engineering instead) and then transferred to my dream school; that way I wouldn't need to get a masters, or I would have been able to have enough money to pay for my masters degree. And I would have been at my dream school. It wasn't until my final year of college however that I realized what I really wanted to do was computer science all along though.

I don't know... I recently read somewhere that where you go to college isn't something you should settle for, with the implication that if you do, you'll regret it miserably, and it's making me ponder and almost completely regret the decision I ever made of any of my decisions senior year of high school to even today. I thought I wouldn't care about this stuff as a post grad, but to be honest, I still kind of wonder. It still irks me to this day and keeps me up at night wondering what would have happened had I ""not settled"" for the university I attended and had I thought things through more. I just don't know what to do or what to even think anymore. Did I really miss out on the opportunity of a life time ""settling"" for both my major and where I attended university?

This is partly because I have quite a few interests (not in order): (human) Geography, Sociology, Ethnology, (macro) Economics, Fashion, Architecture, International Relations/Politics, (Asian) History, Photography

&amp;#x200B;

Also more about myself: I've always been pretty good in the English language; I take Linguistics as one of my subjects, I am the Editor-in-charge in my school. I have quite a 'traditional' mindset meaning my mentality is good grades = good school = good job = good money = good life (&amp; for the most part I am content with that. I don't strive to 'cheat/beat' the system). I am slightly introverted, am not the type to to think so outwardly and critically, enjoy security (being risk-averse). Note that I am awful at the sciences and am average at Math. On Youtube I gravitate towards videos that deal with social issues/current affair of the world; more interested in how they affect people rather than people debating about Trump (I'm so over that kind of politics). I also love watching videos about people's cultures (e.g. learning about Chinese or Korean ways of life etc.) and idk, things like ""How Singapore became the country it is today"" or ""China's Artificial Intelligence"" sort of documentaries.

&amp;#x200B;

I've previously had internships in the Law sector which definitely was interesting, as well as the Business one. I enjoyed both. At the end of the day, I never experienced anything like \*OH this is where I'm meant to be\*, but I was still content. My mentality has always been to do something that will bring me good money and some sort of prestige (though the latter is not as big a deal as the first): I realise that Law &amp; Business will be the easiest to achieve this. So I told my relatives that I'll work towards law school or business. But I wonder if that is necessarily true in the first place. Business &amp; Law are so broad to begin with. I wonder...hypothetically...if were to actually pursue something I'm 101% passionate &amp; interested in, what might that be? What do you think I should do in the future (as well as study in university?)

I go over and pretend to be an old friend of hers and asked if I could talk to her for a sec (just to make sure she was okay in this situation), one of the guys was really aggressive off the bat asking things like “Who are you meant to be??”, “If you’re her friend what’s her name?”.

Okay so long story short, i live in Ontario Canada and attend Trent university and am going into my third/4th year of university. I am studying abroad in france and need to get my visa. For my visa i need my highschool diploma. This is where it gets interesting.

Upon requesting my high school diploma my school informs me I am 1 credit away from graduating high school. To be able to make up my one credit i would need to do a 2 month course at continuing education however, i leave for france in a month (assuming i get my visa; others in my group didnt have their diplomas handy however it wasnt an issue for them and they got theyre visas)

What I am worried about: is it possible for my university to revoke or void any credits I have obtained up until this point because I don't have a highschool diploma??

I (18M) am tired of my parents treating me like a little kid. I have my theories why they treat me this way:

A) I am a bit immature and have a childish sense of humor
B) I am the youngest in my family, with one of my two brothers gone to college
C) I didn’t tell them things that happened to me in high school, like getting rejected or getting into fights (not physically)

However, I am tired of them not letting me do things I can do on my own. Like if I begin to make mac and cheese, my mom will come and and do it for me instead, or if I go outside to get the mail they’ll tell me obvious stuff like don’t talk to strangers and look both ways when I’m crossing the street.

I even tested it right now. It’s 10:00 and there is a 7-11 across the street from my house, maybe a 1 minute walk. I said how I may go down there do get some snacks for tonight and my mom immediately got up and went “No no no! You’re not doing that!” Then my dad said “I’ll go with you.” I said I wasn’t going anymore. And now I’m in my room writing this.

I love my parents, they’re good people, but it’s overwhelming. My friends are moving out and living on their own, yet I don’t know how to cook or clean because every time I attempt to, they intervene. It makes me feel like a little kid. 

I’ve brought this up to my parents and they laughed at me and said “Fine, we won’t help you out anymore” yet they still continue to do this. 

How do I stop this and show them that I can take care of myself?
