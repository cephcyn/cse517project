We were part of this group of online friends and we have just played games together. Eventually everyone went kind of their own way and we stopped playing together... except of this one guy that kept being friends with me. One day he gave me some bad gut feeling and I didn't know what it was but I have decided to not contact him as often. This is when he confessed to me. I was never interested in him because he was just not my type and lived far away so the relationship wouldnt have made it. I tried to reject him as politely as I could and give as little reasons why to not hurt him. He said that everything is ok.

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't talked for few days and then he started messaging but was sort of creepy. It took me a while because I am bad at comfrontations and said that I think it's not best for us to continue our friendship and this is when he exploded. He was telling me very disturbind things. He began to threaten me with various things and despite blocking him everywhere, he began to harras me through snail mail.

&amp;#x200B;

I have closed majority of my accounts as he always found a way to find me. I have changed passwords in remaining very few accounts. I delete and recreate new social media accounts frequently as he have somehow stalked me out and found me (I have pretty unique name and surname so I stopped putting these on my facebook, linkedln is hardest to hide, I can't put a fake name there).

I had gazillion of reddit accounts and always deleted them before they reached my cake day. Now this is the oldest reddit account that I have. Recently I got 3rd follower and it makes me super anxious that guy has found my reddit.

I have GAD and CPTSD and have tried pretty much everything medication wise with not much luck (got serotonin syndrome from Cymbalta once), and the constant trauma of medications making things worse for me made my therapist suggest I take a break to reset and recenter. 

The one thing I have as a safety net that DOES WORK when I am in severe crisis is Xanax. CBT has helped me manage my triggers and has been insanely helpful, but I still have sudden intense flashbacks, nightmares, or times where CBT techniques fail. And so, I use a Xanax, and I’m able to work through whatever I need to work through. It works, it helps, and I only use it when I absolutely need to. 

EVEN SO every. Single. Time. I see a doctor or have to refill the Xanax Rx, they make me feel like sh*t for even using it in the first place. They lecture me on how I shouldn’t depend on it, how it’s harmful, etc and it makes my anxiety skyrocket. Once, it even prolonged a panic attack because I was terrified of using Xanax even though I absolutely should have. 

I KNOW not to abuse it; I KNOW it’s not a long term solution and I’m not trying to make it one. But it legitimately helps me when I need help in between me finding an alternative. Stop making me feel like an asshole for using something that helps me.

I stopped having anxiety for awhile too but recently it came on really strong. My anxiety is entirely focused on having panic attacks and all my coping skills are based on avoiding them. But even more recently I’ve started to not be as scared. BTW I’m on antidepressants for my GAD but I was still having anxiety anyways, but I do think my meds make me more subdued.

It almost feels like I’m just tired of being scared so I’ve just had way less anxiety. Like I’m just like “ok let’s have a panic attack” and nothing happens. Or if I start to get the feelings of having one I’m like “ok, who cares”. And now that my anxiety knows I’m not scared of it it has kind of gone away a bit???

I had a client blow up in my face over a mistake that I made while rushing to accommodate a tight deadline. They screamed at me and called me really horrible names, they called me useless and incompetent and tried their best to get me fired. I went into a huge panic attack. (Note that my boss had my back but this didn’t stop my panic attack) 

While I was driving home from work that day I was stopped waiting my turn at a stop sign and someone rear ended me, no damage to me, my car has about $500 of damage. they got out of the car and screamed at me that I better not call the cops or else, and they were yelling so much and looked very unstable I got so scared of them and I let them leave without taking their insurance. You don’t need to lecture me on that being a bad decision, I was already in the middle of a panic attack and my brain wasn’t working. The day as a whole was just so stressful.

That was two weeks ago and I’ve been in a state of panic ever since. Can’t eat or sleep, keep barfing, have diarrhea, can’t focus, and I keep getting triggered at work anytime I notice another mistake I’ve made, big or small. Each time I notice a mistake I’ve made, even if it was a long time ago, I get a full panic attack and end up barfing and crying in the bathroom. 

Does anyone have advice on how to get out of a anxiety/panic funk? Or any advice on how to cope with these triggers?

Sorry if it doesn’t make sense English isn’t my first language

No idea where to begin… Scared to even write this post. I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember and I believe it is what causes my depression. I’ve had my ups and downs in the past but I’ve just always lived with it and moved on. It all changed when I started Uni at the end of last year. 

I was looking forward to Uni to the independence, the partying and just coming out of my shell. I got a knock on my door on the first night (I’m assuming inviting me out) but I was in the bathroom so I wasn't able to answer. I didn't get a knock again but I heard everyone in the kitchen partying and I was too scared to go in and join. That's how the whole of freshers week went and because of that, I was and still am too afraid to go into the kitchen to make food. Most of the time I buy something from the shop beforehand that I don't need to cook or just get a takeaway. On the odd occasion, I venture into the kitchen to make something simple that just uses the microwave or the kettle because I’m too scared someone will come in when I am in there and if I do cook something more complicated I’m afraid ill do something stupid or embarrassing. 

I stopped going to lectures right at the beginning due to my friend not going as I was too scared to go on my own. Instead, I just mark myself in outside and go back home. There are smaller lectures too with only around 5 people that I cant check myself in to and I’m too scared to go to them out of the fear of being asked a question and not knowing and looking stupid so I didn’t go to them either. The only thing I did attend was the lab activities since they are assessed but that just involved a lot of awkward situations like when I was too scared to contribute to our group project incase it was stupid so I didn’t say anything at all and just look like an arsehole letting everyone else do the work. So after the first few weeks, I had no friends (the one I already had changed course and I barely see them) wasn’t eating well, didn’t attend lectures and spent all my time playing on my pc alone.

Next, I turned to weed which is illegal where I am from. You always hear about people doing activities to escape reality and I never truly felt that until then. Yes, I have my pc that I play on way too much but it never truly felt like I was disconnected from reality. When I took weed, on the other hand, it felt like all my problems disappeared. It was great I wasn’t worrying about every little thing and I actually felt confident. However, that’s all it was... an escape. All my problems were still there and it’s not like I could attend lectures or catch up on work while high because I forget everything straight away and it makes me too dumb to solve any of the questions. So I just wasted time doing nothing.

Eventually, the person in charge of my course emailed me asking why I wasn’t attending the smaller lectures. I simply told them I’m sorry I was just being lazy and I will attend the next ones. Fast forward and surprise surprise I don’t attend like an idiot because of im too tired and scared. I get another email saying I had a meeting with them. I was terrified. I didn’t know what to do. I finally came up with an excuse which I think was just the same as before that I was being lazy which was true just not the full story. The day arrives and I wake up sweating, feeling like I’m about to throw up and I could feel/hear my heart beating. I thought I was just sick but looking back it was probably an anxiety attack. I emailed saying I couldn’t and I could do it the same time tomorrow but didn’t get a response so I showed up the next day and they were there waiting for me I thought. I go in they are upset I didn’t turn up and say they have to reorganize now with the person above them. Embarrassed and terrified. Luckily it was the last week of term that happened so the meeting never came about. There were numerous other things in the first term that got me really depressed and even waste all my money but I don’t want to make you read anymore and also out of fear of people realizing who is writing this.

Finally, I thought I would try DMT. It’s totally safe and people who take it believe they went to another dimension where they have life-changing. I ended up wasting too much money on it. Unfortunately, it didn’t come before the term ended which made me even more depressed as it was my last hope. 

Luckily I had a plan as usual. I was going to catch up on everything during the month I had off and start attending lectures simple. I made a schedule on my phone that even involved things like meditation and journaling. However like always I’m too lazy so I only did that for one day and I stopped and instead just played games all month. I did meditate and journal for a little longer which did help me a little bit but I just didn’t stick with it. Also during that month off, it was Christmas which obviously probably the worst Christmas I had. From Christmas onwards, it was just my dad getting drunk and abusive like usual to everyone except this time it was much nastier. It even got to the point of physical violence and my mum feeling suicidal. That happened until I left except it calmed down a little near the end and is currently okay until next time. 

Next term starts and my DMT has arrived. I was excited and happy for the first time in a while. If you know about DMT it can be hard to breakthrough when first starting. I took it and didn’t breakthrough which got me upset and I even tried more right after it and it still didn’t work. I did get some things when I closed my eyes but not what I wanted.  I decided I would leave DMT for now until I’m with someone who knows what they are doing. Right after that for some reason, I thought I would walk to the city at 11 pm center which then turned into me walking all the way to the next city over. This was all on a Sunday night when I had lectured the next day. I ended up talking some sketchy routes where I genuinely feared for my life at times. I took this walk hoping I would figure something did which I did at the end after 40k steps with one 2 min break. 

I noticed a lot of my problems simply came from me not knowing anything because I didn't attend the lectures. So the plan was to catch up on all the work quickly then start attending and everything would be okay. I got a planner that tracked lots of things and would help me stay on track. I made a list of simple things I would do every day these things include journalling meditation push-ups and so on. I even had all my life goals noted down. Like a bucket list. I also started writing the reason for each one and how I’m going to achieve them. I had some really ambitious goals. It was tough considering I was mostly working all day but I had to do it for a couple of weeks so I was caught up and everything would get easier from then. I could work on my life goals and so on. 

Then after like 3 days of working, I went to the shop one night. I had an awkward interaction with the cashier who smiled to herself about it but it was whatever I’ve got used to doing awkward things. Then when I was heading home I kept noticing people staring at me and felt that some were laughing at me which just kept getting me more upset as I got closer to my flat. It wasn’t like they had a reason to stare I didn't have anything embarrassing on me or anything so it angered me. Then when I got in my flat the group from downstairs came up onto our floor and stood outside my door talking to the guy across from me. I looked through the hole in my door for a few seconds and just realized how lonely I am. I’ve been here a few months now and I had no friends still while everyone is having the time of their lives. This was supposed to be the place where everything turned around for me I was supposed to be happy and confident for once. It really upset me. So I got high again. It really does help me escape. I also found out one of my modules involves multiple group tests where you can be marked down by your teammates if they don’t think you contributed. This is a problem since I’m too scared to answer and even still I won’t know the answer because of im so far behind. One of the tests was tomorrow.

The next morning I woke up feeling a bit rough and I thought fuck it I deserve a day off after working for those three days so I smoked weed all day and played on my pc with one of my friends. I had a decent time but in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about how behind I was and I decided its time to get rid of my weed it just gets me down so I threw it away except the last bit I already had made up.

Today. I planned on attending the lectures since I got an email yesterday about me checking in to classes I didn’t attend and it was my last warning. I was nervous so I thought I would get high to calm my nerves but it didn’t have too much of an effect on me and I ended up not attending. I didn’t attend the group test or the lab either and I couldn’t check myself into that because they would know I wasn’t there. I ended up getting an email from my academic advisor who is also the person who does one of the smaller lectures that I rarely attend. He just said to attend the next session because he wanted to talk to me. I’m assuming it’s about my low attendance and my low marks on the tests.

That’s when I hit rock bottom for like the 3rd time since I started uni.  I got to my flat and started crying for the first time in years. There have been times when I want to cry but I just couldn’t. This time was different. It all came out. I just kept thinking about how fucked I was. I’m lonely have no friends, failing my course my teachers are noticing it probably gonna get kicked out and I am letting my family and myself down in the process. Now I don’t know what to do. I’m not as emotional as I was before so it’s hard to write this as I don’t really feel anything anymore as edgy as that sounds. I’m not feeling so destroyed like I was this morning but I’m not happy either I’m just there. My thoughts when I was crying are that I need to tell my parents and tell my advisor on Thursday what’s happening and hopefully, I can get some help and go to therapy or something.  Then I realized something. I can’t do that to my mum. After everything she has been through and is still going through I can’t let her down like this. I can’t tell her how I fucked uni up and I’m just really depressed. Im currently crying right now even thinking about telling her. She worries about me enough as it is she doesn’t need anymore. But what else am I supposed to do? I don’t think my uni even has a proper therapy I can go to without her knowing. And there didn’t seem like much in the area. Im too scared to tell my teachers the truth. My parents, grandparents just my whole family have always said that im smart and going to do well in life and I believed that more than them. I believe I will go miles farther than what they think so how can I come to them crying saying how im failing uni I have no friends and im not even eating properly. I can’t let everyone down. And even so, I am way too scared to tell them or anyone I know about it I’ve kept it in all these years and it’s finally exploding. I don’t even like my course and I want to quit uni but besides the obvious letting everyone down I want to still do the course because it allows me to work on my goals and what I actually want to do with my life and if they don’t work out I still always have my degree that I can fall back on. 

So, in conclusion, im failing my course, close to getting kicked out, got no friends, not eating properly and way too scared to tell anyone about it. So what do I do?

Reading back on this I realize how much I’ve missed out and how some things truly affected me and how it is kind of all over the place but it’s getting late I’ve been writing for hours and this is already way too long. Just know that even though some of these things are small I am going through hell right now and every time just as things seem to get better they all come crashing down. I need your help. Normally I have a plan but this time I don’t. I just don’t know anymore.

I started taking colder showers so that I could stay in longer as the cold calms me down a bit. It helped and I was able to take a longer shower. Then I started easing back into the bathtub, short cold baths, in and out. 

Every short bath was and is a win for me, I'm not saying that they weren't (and aren't)but this next thing is why I'm so excited. 

I ran a hot bath the other night, added lavender bubble bath, and got in. I turned on my playlist and got in, and... I laid in it for almost an HOUR! I didn't panic once. I felt my anxiety rising up a little, but was able to get through it breathing in the scent of the bubbles.  I took a picture of my legs/feet in the bubble bath to remember that I can do it and saved them with the pictures I take when I get out for exposure therapy.

I’m 26 years old and I have been on Xanax for much longer than is the norm, as well as a high dosage for my size. 


My current schedule is 4mg of Extended Release Xanax, 1mg 4x a day. Also 1mg Instant Release as needed; I usually take that right before bed as I have insomnia and my sleep vitamins don’t completely do the job for me. And I’d like to stay off of sleep medication forever, I’ve tried a few and they all give me worse nightmares than usual. 


I’m highly considering discussing with my psychiatrist to begin the tapering down process during my next appointment, which is in early February. 


However, I’ve been through withdrawals from my prescription being written incorrectly, therefore not being able to get it refilled in time and I don’t want to experience them again. 


(I should also mention that I’ve been on Xanax for YEARS and did not think that was strange at all until my fiancé told me that the pharmacist said they have never seen someone on it for so long and at such a high dosage. I weigh at most 115 pounds!)


If you or someone you know has ever tapered off of Xanax completely, what was the process like? What should I be prepared for? What did you replace it with that has a similar effect on you, even if it isn’t a medicine or vitamin, etc? 


I already have enough health problems and I’m just ready to get off of my prescriptions the safe way, because I know that they do more harm than good in the long run.

For example, im sick now, and ive been stuck at home since saturday. I've been trying to watch tv or movies, but everything I try watching, it's like it triggers my anxiety. It's almost like everything on tv, every movie, holds a triggering memory, which im not even sure exists. There isn't really anything else to do, because my depression makes everything boring and unenjoyable. So I just stay in bed, try and find *something* which will bring enjoyment, but nothing does. So then I feel stuck, with nothing to do. Which brings about even more anxiety (the feeling of being stuck or trapped makes my anxiety skyrocket). It's like depression has robbed me of enjoyment of things, and the inactivity makes me anxious.

Hoping someone can give me some impartial insight - sorry for long post. 

8 years ago me and my mum decided to get two cats - both Siamese. We couldn’t have a dog due to working full time but we figured cats are more self sufficient and we got two for company. One of the cats became very attached to me (not uncommon for the breed) but all was fine as between the two of us they were only ever home alone for about 7 hours at a time and he only preferred me if there was a choice. I should add here, they are house cats, although go in the garden when I am home. 

Fast forward to two years ago, my mum relocated 800 miles away and it was decided due to the attachment to me, I would keep the cats. I work full time and am out of the house between 7.30am and 6.30pm and go to bed from 10pm to 5.30am, so they have 2 hours with me in the morning and 3ish hours in the evening. 

I used to manage my general anxiety by hitting the gym and running 3x per week, but after my mum left I felt guilty leaving them for this extended time as then they would only see me for an hour or so in the evening. I should point out, the Siamese who is very attached to me suffers for separation anxiety which manifested after my mum leaving and it took 6 months to get him back settled. I like to keep a routine to try and manage this and I use feliway etc to help. 

So the reason I’m posting: I feel like my general anxiety is now starting to rule my life again. I only run once a week now as I’m too anxious to leave them for an extra half hour to run after work as I feel like then they don’t get enough time with me. I realise it sounds ridiculous but I feel like they spend 11 hours or their own and I can’t leave them for longer. I get really panicked that he will become poorly again if I stay away for too long. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? I want to add in an extra run in the week to try and have the head space again, and I’ve put on 1.5 stone since stopping the gym which hasn’t helped (not that I’m overweight, about 10.5 stone now).

I'm not asking for a medical diagnosis, just sharing a theory of mine and seeing if anyone can casually share their opinion or experience. 

I think I might have anxiety. 

Brief background: my life went to utter shit about six months ago. 

I've struggled with alcohol abuse for years. That wasnt necessarily my issue though. I just had a ""when it rains it pours"" moment where I lost my job (great job), my girlfriend of seven years, several friends, my pets, my housing situation, my car, and developed afib (ended up in the ER, been to the doctor several times since) all in a span of about a month. If you had asked me a year ago I wouldve said I was on top of the world. As of six months ago, every reason I had to feel that way has disappeared. 

For a while I continued numbing the pain with booze just like I have for every emotional problem I've faced in the last 7-8ish years, but I decided that given the afib I developed it would be best to quit. Went cold turkey. The detox was the hardest eight days of my life. 

I haven't felt 100% since. It's really variable. Talking with the ex alcoholic crowd apparently it's normal for some people to not feel on their game for up to a year after quitting, so I assumed it was just that. But I've been trying to find patterns to the times I feel the worst (if 100% is perfect and my peak detox was a 20%, I'd say my daily baseline these days is about 70-80% with dips as low as 40-50% - unlike when detoxing I can push through them and still function when I really try but it's super difficult) to see if i can do anything to help. Like do I feel the worst when I'm tired, or haven't eaten, or before or after taking meds, etc. Its been about 40 days since the main detox period ended and I hadnt been able to figure out a pattern until I got this theory on NYE. 

Even though I'm still feeling down i figured it'd be good to get out there and live my life still. So i make plans and try to go out with friends like I used to, sans me drinking. After a while I started to notice that those nights were when I felt the worst. Always when I attempted to go out. If it's just with a friend or two getting lunch or going for a walk it's not that bad or even noticeable. But if I try to go to a crowded bar or a club or basically interact with people I don't know well/at all in environments I'm not super comfortable with I start freaking out. Limbs tingle, chest feels uncomfortable, difficulty focusing, feel dizzy, and just generally have a sense of dread, irritability, and discomfort. 

Ive been taking stabs at these kinds of outings basically as soon as the detox cleared up. So maybe 10-15 tries so far. More often than not I either cant work myself up to actually go in the venue or if I do I have to leave shortly thereafter. It didnt occur to me that I might have social anxiety until recently, because I've always been a super social person... but for the vast majority of my adult life I've abused alcohol, which... yknow... liquid courage. For example I had a mini, informal high school reunion thing at a bar a couple weeks ago. Normal me wouldve had 3-5 drinks before even catching an uber there, and wouldve killed a shot and been on my second beer within 10min of arriving. And I wouldve been an absolute, confident social butterfly. What happened to sober me was that I felt like shit on the way there, felt like massive shit once I got there, and then had to bail after 30 min and spent about as long trying to calm myself down in my car before I felt okay to drive. 

Like I said, I had assumed these were just lingering alcohol withdrawal symptoms that happened to flare up at very inconvenient times. Now I'm starting to wonder if I've actually had anxiety for years and just never had to actually deal with it because I would just get hammered at basically every social situation. The only wrench in this theory is that i was a very high functioning alcoholic and when i had to be sober (say, at a big important work meeting with lots of strangers) i never struggled with these feelings. 

Again - not looking for a medical diagnosis. Once my medical insurance kicks back in I'm planning on visiting a doctor and looking into therapy. But even with my insurance it's not cheap, so I figured in the meantime it couldn't hurt to share my experience and see if anyone here has had a similar experience or opinion or whatever.

His left lung has given up on him, which makes it very difficult for him to breath with one lung. Plus, there’s a tumor located in the middle of his bronchial tubes. 

Earlier today, while my mom went back home to fix some things, he forced himself to get up and then lay back down abruptly causing him to have a hard time breathing. I called for the nurses as soon as I saw this happen because I knew it would cause him shortness of breath. He started having a panic attack from the shortness of breath, which didn’t help his situation. He kept asking for my help while kicking and reaching for air. The nurses immediately gave him medicine to help calm him down, which eventually helped his breathing. 

I’m very scared to go back inside the room incase something like this happens again. I literally thought I was about to see my dad die in suffocation. His look of desperation into my eyes pretty much traumatized me because there was nothing I could do but help ease him with my words. I already have anxiety, and I’m scared to have a panic attack, which doesn’t help at all. 

Also, I think it’s fucked up that my mom won’t let me leave the hospice because of what I experienced earlier with my dad. I told her being in the hospice will bring me nothing but anxiety after what happened, but she won’t listen to me. I’ve said everything I needed to say to him, and I just don’t want to see him suffer anymore.

so i’m 17 and i live in the UK and i’m literally so scared about everything and the future and stuff. i’m ftm and i’ve been transitioning since i was 7 (if you’re transphobic just shut up already i don’t care and i don’t want to hear it) and i’ve waited so long on the nhs. (hormone blockers at 11/testosterone at 16) i’m so grateful for the nhs but a lot has changed and now there are so many ppl who are suddenly trans and the waiting times have sky rocketed. i’m on the waiting list for adult services and i need top surgery asap bc dysphoria is crippling and i can’t stand it but my fear is i’ll have to wait another 2-3 years and idk if i can do that.

also by the time i do get surgery i’m worried boris will have sold the nhs and that i’ll have to pay for it bc of whatever reason. there’s no way i’d be able to afford it and i don’t like the idea of asking ppl for money. 

i can’t get a job bc i’m currently still in school and have neurological problems so i’m unable to work even if i could get a job. i get £90 a month which is alright atm bc i can afford my medical stuff bc that’s all i have to worry abt as i still live with my parents. however that might change soon and i might have to live by myself (assisted tho) and i’m terrified about that bc i don’t know anything about living by myself. i have a mental age of 15 too. 

brexit scares the shit out of me i have no idea what to expect and i’m strongly against it anyway. i’m studying law atm and i can’t see how brexit will be any good so i’m just so scared. and now this shit about ww3? wtf i’m so scared bc i don’t wanna serve in the army, i don’t want to fight a war? 

also australia has been on fire since september and this scares me a lot since my cousin lives there and i have a few friends from there. i’m also just worried about the people and the animals in general and i wish there was a way i could help but i don’t think i can and i’m so worried and scared. 

i’m also extremely worried about climate change and not enough people  seem to care enough to do anything about it. 

i am terrified about another 5 years of a tory government bc i’m multiple minorities and i’m disabled and stuff and it’s just scary. the uk doesn’t feel like home anymore. 

i’m also terrified about growing up and tbh i would kill myself but i’m so petrified about death and the idea of non existence that i don’t think i could go through with it.

i’m constantly uncomfortable in my own skin and my heart is always beating fast and i’m sweaty and can’t sleep and  it’s just not ideal. tbh i rlly don’t know what i should do bc i saw camhs for 5 years but they discharged me so clearly i’m not that bad but having this many worries doesn’t seem normal to me.

I'm currently on state insurance which isn't the greatest, since I've had trouble holding a job for years now

It's hard to find good therapy in general, but I've decided I want to focus on finding help for Religious Trauma Syndrome, which is not listed in the DSM

I have OCD and Depression which is complicated by some mental and emotional scars brought on by a number of years as a strict evangelical Christian. I've tried all sorts of things - medication, traditional CBT for 6 straight months, different ways of approaching the OCD itself, and literally nothing has worked so far. 

When bringing up RTS with my previous and current therapists, they'd never heard of it and didn't seem to know effective ways to deal with it.

Would anybody happen to somehow randomly know any therapists or mental health professionals in the area, or perhaps even online, that can handle this type of thing and also aren't insanely expensive?

They called me and told me that they had a man interested in adopting her and that they probably wouldn't need me to foster anymore. So I was like ""um... I was interested in adopting her..."" Apparently they misunderstood my intentions and thought I wanted to foster 😩 they said that since they already agreed to let this other man meet her that they couldn't tell him no now and so now I don't get her 😭 I am so sad about this, I had my hopes up and my house ready.

We all compare ourselves to others and with Facebook and Instagram, I do this constantly whether someone is doing better or worse. I know I shouldn't do that but I feel like comparing ourselves to people is something we are born with. For example, we look up to our role models and struve to put ourselves in their shoes one day just as much as we look down on others and feel thankful that we aren't in that position in life. 

The thing is, Facebook profiles dont tell the entire story of what's going on in a persons life, we sort of create where they're at just judging off their posts. 

I believe moderate use is nice and it's nice for families that are distanced from each other to see what their relatives are up to.

Tl;dr - anxiety and depression are affecting my grades. Doctor prescribed me Lexapro. How bad were the initial side effects and how long did they last? Did you experience apathy? And did you feel a lack of motivation?

My doctor recently diagnosed me with GAD and depression. This has really been affecting my grades for a number of reasons.

Firstly, I’ve been sleeping a lot because 1. I’m anemic and 2. I’m depressed and I don’t like being awake. I always miss morning classes and leave assignments to the last minute. My homework always start piling up and I get too overwhelmed to do anything.

Secondly, It’s extremely hard to study for upcoming tests. I always convince myself that I don’t have enough time to study. Then I get extremely stressed and can’t study at all because I keep crying all the time.

Realistically, I need to work on time management skills so I don’t get overwhelmed. But I also think it would be helpful if I could try to study, rather than just crying and giving up. Nevertheless, it’s extremely hard to calm myself down in that scenario. I experience a lot of physical symptoms of like sweating, shortness of breath and sometimes vomiting. Occasionally, it gets to the point when I start cutting myself as a way to calm my anxiety and punish myself for not planning my time wisely.

Lastly, I’ve also been dealing with social anxiety. It’s hard being comfortable around other people and making friends. I feel like my mind is always clouded by useless worries, I can never think clearly and I’m always on edge.

Not completely sure how to explain this, but It’s hard to focus on school when I feel like there are other aspect of my life that I need to improve at the same time (like my social skills). So this has in turn been contributing to my depression.

So yeah, basically my doctor prescribed me 10mg of Lexapro, which I was supposed to start taking it over winter break. But was afraid of side effects. I wanted to ask you guys how bad the initial side effects are and how long they last? I’m afraid I won’t be able to handle them and will fall behind in school when school starts on Monday.

As well, I heard that apathy is one of the side effects. It would be nice to be more apathetic sometimes but I don’t want it to cause me to be and overall less motivated person.

I know that some of these problems are really common for university students. But I also feel like I’m not functional at times and that might be a sign I should try medication. My mom is very against it. She believes lexapro will permanently damage my brain chemistry and prefers I try naturopathy.

Anyways, just want some input. Thanks for your help &lt;3",True,False,[],False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,316922,public,self,Should I start medication? Does anyone have experience with Lexapro?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ek2upb/should_i_start_medication_does_anyone_have/,house_only,1

Hi, I don't have a story to tell, but I just really needed to talk to somebody.  
I've always been quite stressed, my mom even send me to a lot of psychologist and psychiatrist, when I had 8 years until I had like 14 (cause she died). For a lot of reasons I wasn't shy, but had a horrible lack of confidence in myself. In 7th grade, I was the ""Little red dwarf"", so yeah, didn't really had a lot of friends.  
Years passed and I finally managed to get better, I still had trouble to talk to people and school was still stressing me out but it was okay. 

Last year, my art school didn't want me anymore. Not cause I was bad, I had confirmation from other art schools, but because the headmaster didn't like me (for whatever reason, I'm really shy and usually really polite (sometimes too much)). But the fact that I couldn't be with my friends and doing something that I really liked was really hurtful for me. I needed a lot of time to recover confidence once again. Now I'll finally go to attend new art school, but... Just looking at the school's websites, making me go into a panic attack.

I'm 20f. My grandfather just passed away yesterday, January 3.  We knew it was coming but not so soon. I saw him the day before he passed and I believe I experienced vasovagal syncope. When I looked at him, I began to feel light headed, my ears were ringing, and I felt nauseous and hot. I sat down and put my head between my legs because that is what I've been told to do if I feel faint. I plugged my ears because hearing the medical talk and the machines beeping made everything worse. When I felt that I could stand, I left the hospital immediately. He passed the next day. I do have an anxiety disorder and hospitals make me nervous but I felt fine being in the hospital until I saw my grandfather.

Anyways, the funeral won't be for a few days but I am getting nervous for it. I DO NOT normally have anxiety about funerals, they don't make me anxious at all. But I am getting nervous for this one, fearing that I'll get myself so worked up that I pass out at the funeral. I do not want that to happen. I think I am so nervous because it's been a long time since a close family member has passed. Does anyone have any advice on how to prevent an anxiety attack or vasovagal syncope? It's very hard to calm myself down. If I tell myself ""you're fine, you're not gonna pass out, everything is fine,"" another voice in my head will say ""uh oh, I'm starting to get light headed.""

I’ve been struggling with anxiety since I was a child ( always very anxious , insomnia ) so now every time I think about my childhood It’s always quite dark memories , anyways .

Around when I was 16 I started developing what I would now know as OCD ( lots of intrusive thought mixed with anxiety ) 

Last year I Decided to start therapy and that’s how I found out I had OCD , I tried médecine with the therapy however I didn’t stick to it because I couldn’t stand the way it made me feel ( drowsy , couldn’t eat , and extreme anxiety ) , apparently those are normal for the first 2 weeks but I couldn’t bear it .

Now I have been sick for 2 weeks and extremely down , my intrusive thought are back , my anxiety and beating the crap out of me . ( thinking about maybe trying another type of médecine ) 

Isn’t it absolutely exhausting feeling like you have something following you constantly from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep ? 

Just wanted to post guys and see if anyone have similar experiences ?

I've been dealing with horrible health anxiety these past few months and I'm wondering if someone can chime in to help decide what is the best route of action here.

Basically I can't stop feeling my heart pounding at random times even when I'm not really that anxious. This started to happen a few months ago and I haven't found a cause yet. I've been to the ER multiple times, a couple urgent care centers, my campuses walk in clinic about 6 times, a cardiologist once, and my family doctor twice about this issue. Throughout this experience I was given the following tests. About 6 EKGs, an Xray, bloodwork, an echocardiogram and a Holter Monitor in addition to a thorough examination by the doctors reassuring me that this doesn't seem like a heart problem and is more in line with anxiety. 

However I believe that I somehow damaged my heart through my stupid life decisions before I took my health seriously. For example a few years ago I took diet pills off and on for a few years,  I drank energy drinks when I was a child, I occasionally smoked cigarettes and vaped for periods at a time, I've been on multiple medications for anxiety, depression and ADHD, and drank too much at times. Obviously not all at the same time but just some of the stuff I've done to negatively impact my health throughout my life. 

Anyways I seriously cleaned up my act throughout this past year and a half but am still worried about past damage done to my heart causing my heart palpitations.

I really want to go back to my doctor and sort of try to ask for another cardiologist's oponion but everyone around me is telling me I'm fine. However I just need to know if there was any damage to the heart.

Any opinions out there on what I should do? Does this sound like I'm obsessing on it or do you think that I'm justified in demanding extra tests from my doctor or getting another opinion?",True,False,[],False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,316751,public,self,Anxiety or Heart Issues,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ejpale/anxiety_or_heart_issues/,house_only,1

16M and I realize I have some social issues. My personality has developed in the direction of a dickhead. I realize that I cannot normally socialize to people without saying something mean or rude. From a young age I’ve realized that I’m a bit different from everyone, but that doesn’t mean I can be rude. I find myself always fucking up things somehow when it’s all going well. I’ve always been more of an introvert and so when I push myself to try to be more social I end up saying some inconsiderate things. Also whenever I start to have a really good convo or be kind to someone it just doesn’t feel right. Thus, I say something rude or mean to distance myself due to the discomfort of getting too close. I’m always joking around and having a great time with my close friends, and people from the outside seem to want to become friends with me however I just always end up making a mess of it. I’ve slowly grown into the label/ reputation I’ve gained 😔.

Edit: At the end of the day I feel like a piece of shit for the things I do, and people at my school have a perception/ I have a reputation of being that rude closed off silent guy.

I'm wondering if anyone has had any experience with prolonged anxiety for a couple weeks after a panic attack. I'm noticing a trend that when something traumatic happens. My most recent trigger was my wife and I discussing our marriage, we've noticed that we are bored living in a small town and most nights turn into wife on the couch watching Netflix and me playing video games. My thoughts went immediately to ""she's not happy with me in this relationship; she's going to leave me. I'm going to have to change my whole life and I'm not going to be able to cope without her"". We talked about seeing a counsellor together to help come up with some ways to get ourselves out of this rut. We also talked about the fact that we want to have kids and perhaps we are just not feeling very fulfilled right now.  


We had good conversations come out of it but I am still kind of a mess a week later. I don't seem to have trouble falling asleep because towards the end of the day I feel pretty good but the mornings kill me. I'm constantly waking up at 6am and can't get back to sleep. I have racing thoughts roaring through my brain all morning that tend to subside as the days go on with me getting a bit of relief towards the end of the day. This is probably the 3rd episode I've had like this since I was diagnosed with GAD. But they all seem to follow the same thing:  


It takes me two - three weeks to get back to normal (where my anxiety seems to disappear). But it always seems to happen after a discussion about a big life changing event. I don't want to freak oiut and be out of comission for 3 weeks every time I'm faced with something difficult.

All I could think about was it turning into a nuclear war.  This feeling tainted everything, I stopped functioning, I just forced myself to sleep for like 20 hours a day.  My heart would be racing, really thumping in my chest.  I became hyper-focussed on the news when I was awake, looking for any reassurance that things were resolving.

Some weeks later my feelings subsided.  I was medicated by my doctor with Propranolol beta-blockers and had my Citalopram increased to 40mg.

But it's not a valid reason for not taking action. 
You have to understand  that fear is just the results of a mismanaged mind and a sign that you are not managing your mind properly. 

It's fine to be afraid of success or failure but you will need to fail or succeed  Anyway. 
This is one of the concepts you need to wrap your mind around. Fear doesn't mean something is wrong with you but it just means you are human fighting for survival. 
1 Firstly accepting that irrational fear is going to be part of your life will help you in moving forward. Don't freak out when you feel fear.  know that possitive fear is good and is there to protect you from something that may want to eat you up, or you jumping off the clift,etc. 

FEAR DOESN'T MEAN STOP.
2 you don't have to be fearless before you act. In fact taking action while feeling fear is one of the most important thing you can do to conquer or live above it.

3. most of the fear you feel comes from a thought that you have in your mind. And most of those thoughts are irrational or illogical. If you are sincere to yourself, you will admit that You are creating your own fears with your mind and letting it stop you from achieving what you truly want for yourself. 
You are afraid to act because you THINK of the results of that action. Wether possitive or negative.
This fear is different from the fight and flight response and it's not what am talking about.
4 this will also help. find the thought pattern you have been thinking that is causing your fear for success or failure and change it. If the thought is too deep that you can't change it sooner, get help from a professional . While doing that, choose to just act anyways despite the fear. Anyways you won't die if the result of that action hurts you.

When you take action while feeling afraid all the rational thought you have get proven WRONG.
Exposing yourself to your fear will help you overcome it.
 It i5 don't be afraid of being hurt. ask yourself 'what's the worst that can happen?? If you fail your are not going to die are you??, you will rise back up and live will continue .. If you succeed won't it be great?? Won't you want to have that your dream house and car??
What we  really are afraid of has nothing to do with life or death. It has to do with our own creations. What we have created in our minds 
and believe it to be true though it might not be.
our belief systems.

Don't be afraid of feeling fear. It is your brain's natural response to what it considers as danger though it might not even be. Expecially if something which was once  done that didn't produce the results we wanted is being done again,Your brain freaks out thinking ""what ex happened the last time will happen again"".

Develop the skill of taking action while feeling the fear.
FEEL THE FEAR BUT ACT ANYWAYS.  YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE.
 
SO accept the fear, face the fear, by acting while experiencing the fear. YOU WON'T DIEEEE.

Go go go go. Don't stop there. 

Hope you found this valuable. And in the next few months you could overcome that fear and live a totally fulfilled life.

Should I go back and expose myself to the possibility of v**ting, even though it gives me horrible anxiety and panic attacks? Should I ask someone else to do it? How do I prevent it from happening??

Ever since then any small pain I have in my body I tend to exaggerate a lot and make it worse to think it's something deadly, Like from a neurological disease to cancer. 

I remember going to the doctor and tell them my pains only for it to result in a cold or something minor. 

Sometimes I even fought my doctors telling them that I think they're not doing their job right and i was adamant that I have something more. 

Something that will stick with me is when a doctor told me to not be afraid and that 

""it's like you want me to tell you that you're going to die, you are going to be okay.""

Idk to tell anyone this, this is one of these secrets I keep hidden that only my close family knows. I dont even tell my girlfriend that I have this problem. 

I'm posting this because I'm thru another anxiety phase. I have a sharp pains on head, big lymph nodes on neck, pains In area of body, discomfort in back, back pain...well you see where I'm going with this... I have already made doctors appt and waiting to see them.

I just want this anxiety to go away. 

So far the only best advice I've heard is from my ma who tells me ""well what are you going to do? Worry when the time is needed after doctor visits, if you have something that will kill you, then why worry now thinking you have it, worry about it when you come face to face with it""

When he got home I went against my usual thing of avoiding confrontation and I asked him why. Why hadn't he even sent a ""you okay?"" 

He told me it was because he hadn't thought of me.

I asked him if he cared.

And he said ""I used to care.""

And thanks for reading. 

Something hit me during my super hungover New Year’s Day shift yesterday. It was this head rush feeling I’ve gotten before accompanied with anxiety, stress, fear etc. Seems to happen when I’m hungover.

First time I remember feeling it was when I was messing with my seatbelt and it felt like my brain was confused w the orientation of my hand/wrist muscles. Hard to explain. Was experiencing this again recently- it happens more when I’m adjusting a belt, or reaching below the belt to scratch an itch or adjust something. Its almost like my brain loses track of my haptic senses. I’ve noticed if I visualize what’s happening physically that helps a bit to prevent it.

However, yesterday this dreadful physical feeling of light headedness was happening just from thinking about it, it seemed. It’s almost always paired with this notion that I’m living in a simulation of reality/life and that I’m slipping away from my conscious physical engagement of  this reality. Fucking weird.

It kept me up for hours last night and while focusing on my breath helped a little, the discomfort dragged on and on kept returning. I have this sometimes paralyzing fear that I am in a dream or simulation, that I’m really god or something, coming to the remembrance that life isn’t “real” and that I am the only true conscious being. It is the most terrifying shit ever. I hate it.

I just want to feel normal and engaged with real life as it is. I don’t know what’s causing it or why the physical sensations described above are sometimes paired with it. I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t want to alienate myself from others or overthink myself into madness.

This same sort of sensation and fear was also triggered when I saw the movie Midsommar. An incredible movie but something about it triggered this intense anxiety that life is a dream and that if I think about something my thoughts will cause them to happen. That’s a big part of it. Hard to say how that movie triggered it exactly.

Lastly, it at times feels like the physical sensations paired with this existential dread are the beginnings of what I imagine a seizure or stroke would feel like. I know it sounds silly and ridiculous and unfounded. But nevertheless this has been my experience. I hope it doesn’t continue to worsen. I just want to feel normal and tapped into reality like a healthy individual.

I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given!

I remember I was agonizing over turning 18, and then 20, and now I just turned 24 and I realized my early 20s are pretty much gone. 

The other day I was reading about how in 3 years we'll have another presidential election in my country. When you're 20 in 3 years you'll still be 23, that's not a big change. But now in 3 years I'll be 27, nearly 30. I feel like my life is over and I have no time left. Ever since that realization I have this chest pain that won't go away, I can't shake off this dread, it's consuming me.

Doesn't help that I wasted away my teens and 20s. I'm a closeted trans woman and I missed out on that very short window where had I gotten the help I need I would've transitioned and been nearly indistinguishable from other women.  But now it's too late, so I lost all motivations. After graduating from college I stopped working and studying, and have been like this for the past three years, just doing nothing and wasting away at home, hidden from the world.

I think time passing wouldn't feel so bad had I actually lived those years. I missed out on everything. I never did fun things with friends because I didn't had any for over 10 years. I didn't dated, didn't had my first kiss. While everyone's life has moved on and progressed I still feel like I'm waiting for mine to happen. I remember being 14 and imagining by 20 I would've transitioned and started a new life abroad, I would've made friends and found love, eventually marrying and having a small family, which is, or was, my dream. Now I have no hope left, all I have is this constant worry that is literally driving me insane. I wish I could get into a come and live on my daydreams.

I lost a lot of weight last year and also started a treatment for my messed up teeth, and even though I'll never be able to wear the feminine things I'd like I started to dress better. But it feels too late now, I can't forgive myself for not doing this before. 

At least until now I could forget about it and enjoy some small things while I wasted away at home, because I was 21 and it felt like I would be like that forever.
