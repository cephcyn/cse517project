I can't even do things that I love anymore, most of the time I just lay in bed. The last few weeks I've stayed at home more often than not. The work that I have to catch up is getting overwhelming, which triggers my panic disorder even more. I try to take as little of xanax as possible, as I don't want to get addicted and will get new antidepressiva soon. My psychiatrist has advised me, to take a break from school and stay abroad for a year, to release pressure and stress, with which I clearly can't cope right now. But I am very scared, of how my future will be. \\nI am incredibly lucky, to have supportive parents, who encourage me to do, what's best for me.

The thumping of footsteps is on and off throughout the entire day. I'm on medication for anxiety, and loud sudden thumping/banging type sounds are a nightmare for said anxiety. I've done everything I can; I've texted them numerous times about the sound, talked to my landlord who then talked to them, and just the other night, I talked to them in person. They're good neighbors; they were nice and respectful, and said they'd try to keep it down from now on. But the walls just seem too damn thin; every single footstep on their ground floor is like an earthquake above my room. We're all students, and studying in here is basically a no go because of the noise. At this point, idk what to do. I've tried earplugs, white noise, etc, and none have done the trick. My landlord told me he doubts the noise can be dropped to a level I'm comfortable with just because of the nature of the building. So, what do I do? I could assign my lease to somebody else, but finding an affordable place to stay without noise issues seems next to impossible. Any and all help would be appreciated. Anxiety is the worst.

He will not leave her alone despite her requests to, and she is afraid to report him because he is a cop. What should she do?\\n\\nMy friend has been seeing this guy for a little over a year. It was not serious - it started off as just someone to spend time with and occasionally go out with. They didn\\'t start calling each other boyfriend/girlfriend until only a couple months ago. She ended the relationship with him because he tried to take the relationship to the next level (moving in together) which she was not comfortable with and also because he has a very bad temper and she just didn\\'t see the relationship going anywhere.\\n\\nSince she ended things, he does not stop calling and texting her. She blocked his number, and he has showed up at her house about 3x, all unexpectedly and unwanted, and he would not leave when she asked him to. He forces her to see him and talk to him, then gets mad at her for not wanting to hang out with him.\\n\\nYesterday her and I were out, and he found out where we were, showed up, and yelled at her in public. That was my first time meeting him, and he honestly sounded so crazy and delusional (I hope he was drunk because if he wasn\\'t, he has a warped perception of reality and is really, really, irrational and crazy). He said a lot of weird things, like \"I\\'m literally just trying to talk to you. I\\'m not yelling at you!\" even though he was definitely yelling, he accused her of being with another guy, and then maliciously brought up the fact that she has a daughter (whom she didn\\'t introduce him to, but he ended up meeting recently when he showed up at her house one day and invited himself in). When he is mad, he yells out anything he can - such that she is a slut, a whore, stupid, a bad mother, etc. This is definitely abusive behavior.\\n\\nShe is afraid to call the cops because he IS a cop. She thinks the other cops will just take his side, and then he will be even angrier and crazier with her for reporting him. She is scared of him (and I am too), so she just does nothing. What should she do? His behavior absolutely isn\\'t okay.

However he’s not being truthful to his friends because he’s a pathological liar and he’d rather pretend than actually do the work it would require for him to get better. \\nWhilst he tells his friends he’s stopped the porn, reckless dating and is using a brick phone when he’s actually been going on dates with women who DONT KNOW what he’s capable of and looking up jailbait porn. He knows he can’t get away with looking at actual illegal stuff for now (I have no doubt in my mind that he will resume it when things have settled because he has no real remorse or intention of getting better) so he’s substituting it with going on dates with girls who are 18 but look young or just women who are younger than him in general because they’re less likely to want something long term. \\nThis arrangement would be less creepy if I didn’t know what I know...  he’s also looking up of age girls on Instagram but who look about 14 and have that prepubescent type of body that I know he likes. \\nAnyway I know we’ve broken up and it’s not my responsibility anymore but I feel a sense of guilt towards the girls who will get involved with him and don’t know what he’s done?

       "  \"\\nHey Reddit I'm having a problem. My childhood friend doesn't want to know me. We used to be joined at the hip, we did everything together. We were both very hard working and I was very proud of her when she got into one of the country's top law university. Everything was fine until she met this guy who sponged off his parents and had never worked for anything in his life. My friend became very isolated not just from me, but from all of her other friends apart from one. When it came for everyone to go off to university she decided not to go last minute and instead move in with her boyfriend and his parents. Since then, she hasn't worked or gone into further study, hasn't made an effort to contact her friends or family (apart from the ones who clearly like her boyfriend) and has adopted a snobby-like attitude towards people who are achieving things for themselves (was told by the only mutual friend who is still in contact with her that she mocked me for getting a year long internship at university) .\\nI've tried my best to stay in contact. I've asked her how she has been and attempted to meet up with her on several occasions. A couple of months ago I came to the conclusion that I shouldn't keep trying to do this when she is clearly not interested and after messaging her last night with the last of my messages being left on read, I knew I was correct.\\nI'm upset over the fact she has changed so much. We have so many memories together. We grew up together and I'm disappointed she has chosen her boyfriend over her friends, family and individuality.

However I'm having some issues with my host family and I'm not entirely sure how to deal with them.\\n\\n1. My family doesn't really do anything as a 'family' - the parents are divorced and live separately and my siblings are quite independent so I've been spending most of my time on my own. I've asked to do activities before but plans always seem to fall through. Should I just keep asking more? I don't want to put them in a bad financial situation or pressure them. Or should I take it to my local coordinator instead? I feel really jealous of the other students whose families take them on vacation with them and I don't want to spend all my time here alone.\\n\\n2. How do I deal with being alone so much of the time? My older sister and my mum stay a lot of nights at their respective boyfriend's houses and so we often don't eat meals together and it's getting pretty lonely. Is there any way I can ask them to spend more time here or to eat meals together without seeming rude? Also I've missed out once on a field trip by not having my host mother be able to sign off on it, as she wasn't at home and I didn't see her for a couple of days. I'd like to avoid this in the future. \\n\\n3. My younger host sister is also acting strangely. Wearing my clothes without asking as well as taking some of my other things like my lighter and then denying it, passive-aggressively encouraging me to leave the house whenever she has friends over, not talking to me apart from when she needs help with homework, amongst some other incidents. I initially chalked it up to just being 15 and weird but it's rather alienating. I want her to understand that I'm a member of the family now and I wish she'd include me. However she has a short temper and I'm worried about how I can phrase it right. \\n\\nSorry for all the questions. Any shred of advice would be greatly appreciated. (Also, although I'm not entirely happy with my situation, I don't want to change families cause I've already changed families from one that really wasn't working and I've settled in at this point.)\\n\\nThank you :-)\"),\n",

       " '7q484y': ('Should I quit my job and end my friendship?',\n",
       "  'I recently took a part time job as an administrator for a local business group. I took the job mainly because I enjoy helping in my community and could see some opportunities to help the group improve with what they were doing (I already have a professional career).  A friend of mine is the president of this group, but my employment was not through her - I work for the collective members. Having said that, as president she sets the direction for the group and I see it as sensible to have her agreement on what I’m doing. \\n\\nThe group was in quite a mess organizationally. They did not have a list of their members, did not have up-to-date contact information, their website hadn’t been updated in two years and contained inaccurate information, and many local businesses had zero interest in joining the group because they did not see value to their membership. \\n\\nI started at the job in earnest at the beginning of this week. First I used the information I had to create a list of who I thought might be members. I also created a second list of potential members. I then got to work calling each person on the list to update contact information - in about a quarter of the cases I was using google to find a phone number and going from there. Next I redesigned the registration form and list of benefits so that I could send these forms out to the current and potential members as 2018 fees are now due. As part of the same document (and on the request of the board) I also included a three page survey with some fairly general questions designed to help us understand the needs and wants of the membership. I uploaded this document to a closed Facebook group for the board and asked for feedback, and I texted my friend to call it to her attention.  This was Monday\\n\\nOn Tuesday my friend replied with some feedback. She made three points, one was helpful but the other two didn’t make sense to me so I called her. We both agreed on that conversation that the second point was a misunderstanding on her part and that left the third item. This was that I had listed as a benefit that local businesses would have a link on our website. She didn’t want me to include this as I hadn’t yet updated the site and “what if I couldn’t really do it”.   I thought it was an important point to include so I suggested that I take a few hours to spend on the website and make sure I could do what I was claiming. She agreed. A few hours later I contacted her to let her know I had learned how to do this and already created a new page with links to ten of the businesses. I asked if I now had her go ahead to say we could link to local businesses and she replied saying “you don’t need my go-ahead”. \\n\\nI continued to update contact information on Wednesday and to improve the website while I waited to give board members a chance to look over the membership benefit list, registration form, and survey I’d posted on the Facebook group. During this time I texted my friend and commented that I hadn’t received any input on the survey. She did not reply. She also did not reply when I sent her a message asking her to please look over the member list and provide any contact info she may know for those businesses that I could not find by using google. She also did not reply when I texted her to say that one of the local business owners had a promotional idea. \\n\\nThursday I sent an email to all current and potential members with the registration package. \\n\\nFriday morning I received a text from my friend asking if I had sent out the survey. I replied that I had. Her reply was “what??? You weren’t supposed to send that out without showing me!!!!”  Now I found this quite confusing as the survey had been available for her to see for 4 days, she had given me feedback on the document but hadn’t expressed any reserves about the survey portion despite my specifically calling it to her attention, and the last thing I’d heard from her was that I didn’t need her go-ahead. I said I thought she’d seen the survey as she’d given me feedback on the first few pages of the document. \\n\\nShe then replied that she had called me and told me not to proceed without her go ahead. At this point I was getting frustrated with both her refusal to be accountable for what was clearly her own error in either not actually noticing the survey in the first place or not communicating that she had any reserves whatsoever and also with the tone she was taking with me, which I did not find was appropriate for a professional colleague. I told her I had not proceeded without her approval and that I didn’t like the attitude she was taking with me. \\n\\nI didn’t hear from her for the rest of the day but when I did it was a text saying that I am not to proceed any further with my work and that I also should not meet with the local business person as scheduled on Monday to work on her promotional idea, and that I am to communicate with another member of the board from now on. She later stated that I would be instructed on my “parameters” by the other board member. \\n\\nI told her that I thought this was a terrible way to treat a friend and she replied that she was trying to save our friendship by not talking to me about this further. \\n\\nBut. Right now I really don’t know that I want to continue with either the job OR the friendship.  I am so angry at what I perceive to be my friend’s inability to admit her own error and her insistence on blaming me, her hostile tone, and her action in choosing to speak to other board members rather than calling me to hash things out. On the other hand, until now she has always been a good friend and has been someone that has been kind and generous in the past. I’ve trusted her through some difficult recent times in my life and I hate to lose that. \\n\\nI’m not sure what to do. Thoughts? Anyone?'),\n",

They have mentioned thoughts of suicide and self harm on multiple occasions, but refuse to get help. \\n\\nWe were classmates in an English class and from there I guess they made up their mind to befriend me. I didn’t interact with them much, but they started following me around and talking to me near constantly. I obliged them, and from there they never left me alone.\\n\\nIn a very long and uncomfortable text conversation they came out to me as bi, and in a moment of horribly lapsed judgement I came out to them too. I’m not sure what I was thinking, because fast forward a few weeks later they outed me in front of a group of piers by saying “ARE YOU STILL GAY??” like it was hemorrhoids or something and it would clear up within the week.\\n\\nEver since I mentioned my orientation they seemed obsessed with the idea that I was in love with them, often bringing it up in conversation, and, if I denied it, following up with a ‘jk lol xD’ or something along those lines. They still never leave me alone about it to this day, despite the fact that I have made it clear that I am not interested in them in that way.\\n\\nI’m pretty introverted. That’s probably obvious, since I’m on Reddit asking for advice rather than doing actually confronting my problems.

I denied it at first and told myself that I don’t actually like him I just like the idea of him. I did this to myself because when we first started talking he told me he was moving, not like to a different town but like a different country. So when I started realizing I had these feelings I didn’t want to believe it. I eventually went to my friends for advice and they said just go for it he’s going to be here for a few months so take your shot now while I have a couple of months with him. So I ended flirting with him a lot and he would flirt back and I could tell he started to like me back, we would always make fun of each other and then have deep conversations five minutes after. He was just one of those people I felt comfortable telling anything to. We have the same group of friends and I guess he’s told our mutual friends that he doesn’t want to lose me when he moves and stuff like that. I thought it was strange cause I thought we were just gonna keep in touch and stay friends. So now it’s at the point where he’s moving in less than a month, and one of my friends just recently told me that he was planning on asking me out the next time we hung out. My friends told me to try a long distance relationship and if it doesn’t work it doesn’t work. I’m afraid that if it doesn’t work i’m going to lose him for good and now i’m putting a pressure on myself that it has to work out. I’ve also thought of just telling him how I feel and how I don’t know if im ready for a long distance relationship, we’re still young so we still have our lives ahead of us. I’ve seen what long distance relationships can do to people and I really don’t want that to happen to me but at the same time this guy has made my life 100x better in the past few months. He’s honestly an amazing person and if he wasn’t moving I would say yes in a heartbeat, like he makes me feel so special and anytime I think about him I get major butterflies in my stomach. He’s also a very touchy person and always makes physical contact and every time he touches me wether it’s playfully hitting my arm or trying to throw me in a pool my heart skips a beat every time. I’ve never been in love before and so I don’t really know what it feels like exactly but this is the closest I have been to love and I don’t want to throw it away.

       "  \"Super long post but whatever. I'm a 23 year old guy basically living at home again after college. Was supposed to be out by now, desperately want to leave, though I feel like I'm stuck and no decision I make will leave me feeling happy.\\n\\nI'll start by saying that I hate Los Angeles. Like, haaaate it. Went twice this year to see if I could see myself living there, and I honestly couldn't. However, after talking to a bunch of people in the entertainment biz on LinkedIn, it seems that I have to move to LA if I'm serious about having a career in TV writing. \\n\\nI resigned myself to that, but knew I wouldn't feel comfortable moving across the country from NJ to LA all by myself. I had a friend living in LA that I didn't necessarily want to live with, but given how expensive living by yourself in the city is, figured it was the best course of action to move in with this friend. I let him know back in May that I'd be joining him out there. Two other friends of mine had been discussing a move to LA, and also agreed to be roommates. I offered one of my closest friends, who had gone through a traumatic ordeal that left his finances in shambles, a spot on the couch until he got his life back on track. So as of September, there were supposed to be five of us living together in LA, and the friend living out there was tasked with looking at houses and apartments for us.\\n\\nSuddenly, he decides he doesn't want to live in LA anymore. He moves back to Pennsylvania with his parents and gets a job at a phone store, and has no intention of going back to LA, as he never really had a reason to be there in the first place (no creative pursuits). \\n\\nThis is mostly fine with me and everyone else because, like I said, I didn't really want to live with this friend anyway. He's terrible with money and horribly immature. Finding a place will be harder, but not impossible. \\n\\nThen I get a call from the other two roommates, who tell me they need a few more months to get their finances back up, so we should postpone to move to January. I say fine, it's not like I had anything specific waiting for me out there, I can pursue my career just as well in January as I can in October. Then a few weeks later fifth roommate who was supposed to stay on the couch until he got back on his feet finds a job and an apartment in Philly. The two who called about needing to get their finances up have not been communicating very much at all about the move. I'm back to square one, possibly moving to LA by myself, which I absolutely cannot afford and really do not want to do. I know what type of person I am, and I know I would fail in LA by myself.\\n\\nAll the while, I've been in a relationship that became exclusive almost immediately, and we've been totally inseperable since the beginning of August. What was meant to be a fling that would likely end when I move to LA has turned into a fairly serious relationship. She and I recently went to New Orleans together for a few days, which for each of us was our first vacation with a significant other. We didn't even bicker and both absolutely fell in love with the city. The energy of New Orleans makes me feel like it's where I belong, or at least somewhere I could live, which is a feeling I didn't get even once in my trips to LA. In fact, I've been to 6 different major cities this year, and the only one I liked LA more than was Orlando.\\n\\nTo make matters worse (or better), I'm completely head over heels for this girl. Everything feels right, and I've never been happier. I can't exactly speak for her but she seems just as smitten, perhaps even more than me. The youth and speed of our relationship is obviously a bit of an eyebrow raiser, but like I said, something just feels right. I've been in a 4+ year relationship before and had plenty of flings, none have ever felt this good and immediately comfortable. I didn't and don't want to leave her behind because for the first time in my life I feel emotionally fulfilled.\\n\\nSo now I'm stuck trying to figure out what comes next in my life. I graduated college last year, basically forced myself out of my mentally exhausting job, collected unemployment for half the year and now am living off my savings account and some inheritance money. I've been trying to find freelance work for both writing and photography but haven't had any luck yet. I've been offered a few positions both in Philadelphia and near my parents' house, but I don't want to take up a full time position right now without knowing where I'm going next, and none of the positions being offered are necessarily things that I want to do (i.e. selling cars in a dealership, working as an administrative assistant for $15 an hour, etc). The LA plan has almost completely dissolved and now I'm not even sure if I want to do it anymore, despite still wanting to work in the industry. It has also occurred to me that I don't have nearly enough in my portfolio, or really any of the connections I'd need to seriously expect to find gainful employment in the entertainment industry, at least at this stage.\\n\\nWhich leaves me where I'm at now, asking for advice from strangers on how to untie this very convoluted knot I've gotten myself into. My girlfriend is set to go to grad school next year, and seems set on Austin, TX, although she's also considering New Orleans. If she chooses New Orleans I'd gladly move with her, though I'm not sure she'd welcome living with a partner, as she's stated before that she doesn't know if she could ever do it. I have lived with a partner before and know how to handle it. We haven't ever seriously discussed living together but she frequently makes half-jokes about how we should move in together and get a dog, etc. We looked at apartments in New Orleans on Zillow and fantasized about it a little.\\n\\nI know it's probably short-sighted, even foolish, to abandon a long-term plan and life goal because of a new relationship. However, it seems like everything in the universe is screaming at me not to go just yet. I mean, LA is literally on fire right now. On one hand, I know she wouldn't want me not to go on account of her. On the other, she tenses up every time I even mention LA. Then I think of how dumb I'd feel if I stuck around just for her, only to have her leave me when she goes to grad school. I need to get out of my parents' house but I don't know where to go because I don't want to commit to a long-term lease or job. I could keep going with the flow, but I'm hemorrhaging money from my savings and feel listless and adrift living with my parents. If I move to LA, it's unlikely she joins, I'm probably completely alone, and I'm unhappy. If I stay around here, I still have her, but basically nothing else. If she decides to move to New Orleans for grad school and wants me to join, I'm not sure how I'll be able to resist changing course and putting my dreams on hold, but I'm also not sure what I'd do for a living down there. Every decision feels like a catch 22, and in the end, I just want to be happy and not feel like a failure. If you were me, what would you do?\"),\n",

I take Honors and AP classes, and my dream school is UC Berkeley. I try to be nice to everyone, including my bullies. Though sometimes, I know when I have to be bold and stern. Also, I want to be a biochemist, while doing acting and dancing on the side.\\n\\nGrowing up, both of my parents were physically and emotionally abusive. When I was younger, they’d often hit (I had a lot of red marks) and yell at me for SPILLING WATER ON THE GROUND. She’d yell at me for such miniscule things that one time when I accidentally spilled water in school, my 6th grade band teacher told me to just put newspaper over it, and I, kid you not, asked him if he was mad. He replied “No. Why would I be mad? It’s just water.” When I was really young, I would go to my dad and show him something I made, but he’d reply with one word: “Go” which meant “get out of my room” or “go away.” He would do this alllllllll the time. “Go.”Before applying for high school, I really wanted to go to a prestigious school in my city, and I told my parents I wanted to go to x high school. My father started to tell me that I had no chance, but I told him I could do it. Still, he tried saying that I had no chance. He acted like such a kid when said “hah yeah right” when I told him I could do it.. He start asserting how that prestigious school I mentioned was “bullsh*t.” Soon, in my high school years, my parent’s stopped hitting me with closet hangers, and I assume it’s because I was older, and they were worry that I am able to tell authorities now; however, they continued to emotionally abuse me by telling me that my hairstyle is bad, saying things such as “your teachers hate your hairstyle” “It bothers them a lot so they really hate looking at you.” At random times, my parents would ask me to come over to them for a second, and there would be a photo of a girl on my father’s screen. She looks like some Chinese underage promoter or model, and my father would say “look at her hair style. You should get this hairstyle and look like her.” This happened more than I could ever count. If I were to estimate, I’d say that it happened at least 5 times EVERY month for 2 years. My parents got so annoyed that I kept denying what they wanted to do with my hair that my father felt like he needed to scream/yell “YOU’RE SO F**KING UGLY” to me when I was in my sophomore year of high school. In the same year, I attended an after school science program at the American museum of natural history. One time the bus took 40 minutes to come, and I tried to call my parents that I was going to be late, but my phone died. After the bus came and I walked home, I opened the door, and the very moment I take my first step into the house, my father shoves me to the ground and I land on my butt. It took both of my grandmothers to hold him back because he tried to hit me. He didn’t even give me a chance listen to what I had to say about the bus being late. In my junior year of high school, my parents would gossip about me while they had dinner. For example, I eavesdropped and my dad said “You think she (me) is so smart? Hah yeah right.” And then my mom would giggle/laugh WITH him. I didn’t ‘mention this in the beginning, but I have a younger brother, and he has never experienced these things from my parents (I get better grade than him, and I behave better, but he still doesn\\'t experience the things I experience from my parents). They also never gossip about him.  In my senior year, my parents still gossip about me and my intelligence. It’s really ironic because I have great grades, while in high school, THEY had 55-60 grades (I saw their report cards before. My dad also kept lying to me about what school he went to: He told me that he went to a prestigious high school, but then another time he said he went to a high school with a completely different name. Additionally, my dad never went to college, but then he tells me that he went to Columbia University. :/ ). Now, I go out on the weekends a lot because I have to go to my acting and dancing studio, and my grandparents give me money to get myself food whenever I get hungry while I am outside because the first thing I do is get ready to go to my studio and not eat. They are really nice, it fathoms me how they are the parents of my parents. Because it is senior year and sending scores cost $15, I’ve decided to starve myself and save up the money to pay off the senior dues ($200) and college application/sending scores ($360) myself. Recently, I eavesdropped on my dad, and he thinks I’m lying about saving up the money. For example, my mom tells him “oh she’s saving up her money” and my dad would say “Hah. Is that even true?” Today, I arrived home, and my dad gave me a checkbook to write down the money I am putting into my bank account to see if I’m lying, but I have to use this money for my college applications.\\nHere is a little more info about my parents: I have never heard them talking about anything they share interests in or laughing about something funny together. It is ALWAYS something negative, always complaining, and always saying the words \"stupid\" or \"crazy\" regarding people they know. They gossip about other people—and me. My mom shares the same ideas with my dad, but it seems like she only acts like that when my dad is around. When my dad isn’t around, she seems more happy and free. (My mom was watching a drama show, and when she heard my dad coming home, she quickly turned it off and went to go act like she was cooking all day). My parents want me to go to college in the city because “you’re a female” and so I could stay home , but I’ve applied to great schools far away.\\n\\nP.S : I cried a few times while I wrote this post, remembering those scenarios clearly. Sometimes I’ve considered plastic surgery because of my parents but I don’t think I would ever do it because it costs a lot, and sometimes when I’m in a happy mood with my significant other and friends, I’m fine with my looks. My cousin’s parents / my dad’s siblings are so different. They support me going to prestigious colleges far away, and they told me that they support me trying out new things for the sake of enjoying activities. I don’t get why my dad is the way he is, and I have always envied my cousins so much. \\n\\n*My mom is nice when my dad isn’t around\\n\\nUpdate: 1/4/2018 : This morning, I made myself quinoa salad and my brother put pizza in the oven.

I know the military will benefit my family's future a lot but if I decide to join I wouldn't know which branch to join or which is really best for military families. My wife has kinda been telling/hinting me to join, she even says she'll join if I dont. Mainly because we both feel like were at that point of things not getting better job/career wise.

       "  \"My sister and her ex (D) dated for less than a year but were in love/had great chemistry. Sister left him because she fell in love with another man. She is now single.\\n\\nAfter their break up, D and I started to see each other regularly. And now I'm falling for him. But I never told my sister I'm seeing D on a daily basis.\\n\\nThere was this event going on in our town and D asked if I'd like to go with him, as friends. I felt so bad about that specification but I accepted.\\n\\nI anticipated seeing acquaintances that night, and my aunt (who lives with us) had mentioned she might be going. So I let my sister know I would be going with D. Her first reaction was to say she won't allow it. I repeated that he had extended the invitation as a friend. She started to list off all the things D had done for her on their first few dates, asking if he did the same with me. I denied everything in front of her, but some things were similar. She said she thinks D is doing all this to get back at her and that he isn't really interested in me. She said she is trying to protect me.\\n\\nI did my best to now show how hurt I was because I don't want my sister to know I like him. This conversation happened two days before the event. She had our aunt ditch her plus one so she can come along instead. She went out of her way to make sure she looked her best. I noticed she even wore a necklace D had gifted her. This was after she found out D had gifted me a necklace to thank me for my help.\\n\\nNeedless to say, that night was weird. I felt miserable about the whole thing and though D was really fun, it was so unsettling to know my sister was just around somewhere. At some point D asked me to dance. I was tipsy and bold and we were getting close. I think I was still bitter about him asking me to come along as friends or maybe I just wanted to see how he feels. But I asked him if that's how he usually dances with his friends. He said no and I just instantly locked up. I was feeling nervous, and guilty and I kept thinking about what my sister said. It didn't help that I kept worrying about her or our aunt seeing us.\\n\\nI left shortly after that, and I left things between us feeling pretty weird. He kept texting me, asking me out for brunch, then lunch. I didn't reply. I was thinking about us and I decided I was stupid so this morning I left my house early so I could get us coffee and catch him on his way to work. I know his schedule pretty well so I just waited outside his place but nothing. I started to worry I might have missed him, so I sent him a text asking him if he was already at work. He replied no and asked me if I wanted to meet up with him before so I knocked at his door and, who guessed it? He had company over...\\n\\nSo maybe my sister was right after all?

       " 'bqwccn': ('How do I go about making my boss see how much of a sleazy slimeball my coworker (65m) is?',\n",
       "  'TL;DR - Coworker is that \"group project partner who does nothing but gets all credit\" guy, and Boss is completely unaware. I\\'m afraid to cause waves, but something needs to be done.\\n\\nMe - 23m, been working with this company less than 2 years.\\n\\nBoss - 50-something man, VP of the company, strict and seems unapproachable besides emails.\\n\\nJake - 65m (more or less), elderly coworker and lazy piece of garbage, been with the same company his whole life.\\n\\nI am a relatively new hire and I have been paired up with old Jake, so essentially everything we do is as a team. You know how you\\'d have lazy assholes doing nothing and getting all the credit in high school group projects? Jake is that dude on steroids. He\\'s essentially counting on the fact Boss is almost never around to jack-shit and make me do all the work. If there\\'s a testament to his lack of work ethic, it\\'s that despite being a newbie, I have become his unofficial manager, and he won\\'t do a task unless I seek it out for him and drop it on his desk. That being said, even if I DO drop the task on his lap, there\\'s a good chance he won\\'t do it either; he\\'s the kind of coworker who looks you in the eyes and says \"no, I don\\'t want to\" without a trace of shame or self-awareness, even if he\\'s currently playing a fucking browser game.\\n\\nThe thing is I am virtually certain Boss has no idea how little work Jake really does. EVERY TIME there is a difficult task that requires expert skills, Boss sends it by mail to Jake... and Jake just forwards it to me. Jake cannot access the back office of our website (because he always refused to learn), despite a significant portion of our work being there, and he\\'s so set in his ways that he is the only person in the entire company using a PC instead of a Mac, so a specialized software we need cannot run on his computer at all, and I do 100% of all the work related to both. Yet, Boss still asks Jake to do all tasks related to the back office and the software - since all the tasks end up completed (by me), I\\'ve eventually come to the realization that Boss thinks Jake is the one doing all of it. Another thing is that the first person to see a ticket is credited as the main person working on it, and Jake opens every ticket, signs them then closes them without completing them - I am the one actually doing the work, but I\\'m just credited as the person who gave them a second look. During a company outing at a bar, one of the rare occasions when we see Boss in person, he loudly congratulated Jake for doubling his numbers in the past year, but Boss didn\\'t say a single word to me that day.\\n\\nThe main issue with the current situation is that Boss makes me do all the menial tasks, as he thinks Jake is the brains of the operations doing all the complex, important ones. I work about 55 hours a week (last week was harsh and I easily worked 70+ hours), but we don\\'t clock in and the boss is almost never physically in the office, so he doesn\\'t know. Jake arrives at work around 10 am and is gone by 2 pm at the latest. Since we\\'re paid in salary, he makes easily 50% more than me for doing just a fraction of the work I do. Even when he\\'s around, he barely does anything - he\\'s got a task he does every Wednesday, for instance, that he claims takes all day so he\\'ll refuse to do anything else. He misses enough days for me to cover his Wednesdays numerous times, and I know from experience that this task doesn\\'t take more than 20 minutes. Doesn\\'t stop Jake from pretending to work on it all day then complain about how difficult his one tiny task is.\\n\\nThe last nail, I found, is how outspoken Jake is about refusing to work. He digs his heels in the ground and puts more effort towards avoiding a task than he\\'d exert just completing it. For example, I have to send out a newsletter, which takes about 25 minutes every single day (it\\'s menial work, as Boss still thinks I\\'m the new hire who can\\'t handle real work) and I started training Jake to do it so there can always be someone in the office to do it. But a few days later, Jake triumphantly told me to stuff it and that he complained behind my back to Boss about me trying to \"pawn off\" my work onto him, and Boss told Jake he didn\\'t have to do the newsletter and that he should be focusing on more important tasks. Now, I cannot even take days off (or I have to work on my days off) because I have to do that stupid newsletter every single fucking day of my life. Jake takes days off out the wazoo and I always do his job on top of mine without complaints, but the one time I asked for one day off, on Christmas, he freaked out. He started by going to Boss and requesting that I\\'m not allowed to even take a single day off; when his request was rejected, he was making the rounds in the office trying to find someone else to cover my job because he couldn\\'t bear the idea to actually do real work even once. Nobody agreed. On the day I was out, he just didn\\'t show up and the work went undone. The next day, we were both disciplined, and my day off (approved long in advance, within my rights and literally the first day off I ever took with this company) was treated as if it were as bad as Jake\\'s no-call no-show.\\n\\nI\\'m quiet and shy, and I hate making waves. I tried all the possible mental gymnastics to tell myself the situation was fine - he\\'s going to retire soon, I\\'m just out of university and should stay in my lane, etc - but I reached my boiling point. I need to come forward to Boss and do something to end this situation. But I\\'m really afraid (What if Boss just doesn\\'t believe me because of Jake\\'s seniority? What if Jake is just given a stern talking to, and it causes bad blood and retaliation from him against me?) and I don\\'t know how to go about it. My boss also seems really unapproachable; he\\'s rarely in the office, when he\\'s around he\\'s either locked up in his office or walking around with that intimidating aura that says \"If you talk to me, you had better make it worth my time.\" Jake obviously has no qualms running to Boss to complain and snitch on me, but it\\'s so different from my usual personality that I\\'m frozen and unsure how to proceed...

A few months ago, the first time he entered my new house I presented him with alternate option to bidets because I knew he was worried about it. \\n\\nI told him - \\n1. Here are some butt wipes. \\n2. You can also just fill this water bottle and use while you’re on toilet - same concept right? \\n3. You can also use the shower. \\n4. Sorry I don’t have a bidet-this is America. We just don’t have them. \\n5. I SPECIFICALLY asked him NOT TO USE THE SINK TO WASH HIS ASS. (Which he had done before in my previous house - so I made sure to cover my bases. That sink didn’t have other areas to put my stuff, this one had more surface) \\n\\nSame or next day, there is water all over my sink... and I ask him “hey... did you wash your butt in there after doing your do... even though I specifically asked you not to?”\\n\\nOf course he denies but eventually he admits it because it was too obvious. \\n\\nI got really angry but I tried to use general logic and common sense and hygiene for my argument. \\n1. My contacts live there- this is how people get pink eye\\n2. Despite what you believe, you can’t control where the water is splashing and even if I can’t see the actual brown of your crap, the water you are splashing has the bacteria in it and it’s everywhere \\n3. My TOOTHBRUSH is there. (Not to mention he is so unaware of his surroundings that he often drops my toothbrush in the sink)\\n4. Other general things I use at my sink to keep myself clean are there. And you’re spreading your literal crap all over.  \\n5. I wash my face there. My hands.\\n6. If you have a problem like this, just tell me and we can think of other methods rather than resorting to something like this. \\n7. It’s just gross. End of story. \\n\\nHe apologized just to apologize. But tells me he can’t believe he’s being questioned on his hygiene and doesn’t really see a problem with it. And is so sure that him just wiping away the dirty water with just more water will fix the problem. And that the crap water can’t possibly be splashing on my toothbrush... \\n\\nI realize I will never get him to understand, so I tell him-regardless of what you believe, this is my place, it’s my sink, you have alternate ways of cleaning your hole, so please don’t do it (again). \\n\\n*Same week, I find that he has done it again.*\\n\\nAt this point I am fuming - not at his general lack of common sense and hygiene, but his inability to follow simple directions. \\n\\nWe had a long fight after that- same bs argument on his part. And some additional stuff like “I was distracted. I wasn’t paying attention.” THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU ARE DISTRACTED. ITS A LONG PROCESS. THIS IS INTENTIONAL. YOU HAD TO INTENTIONALLY DECIDE THAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS THING KNOWING HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. \\n\\nHe said my alternate options weren’t good/viable options. He said he hasn’t killed anyone or committed a crime - and clearly doesn’t understand the problem. \\n\\nRegardless, he promised he wouldn’t do it again. \\n\\nIt’s been a few months now and he is visiting again - I thought we were really past this. But today - NEW APARTMENT, WHERE I ALSO STRESSED THIS TOPIC, I walked into the bathroom and found his pants down in front of my sink with the sink all wet. \\n\\nHe denied again - but I saw actual brown spots on my sink as he was trying to wipe them away so I wouldn’t see. \\n\\nHe said he was trying to be fast and washing his butt in the tub would have taken too long. Idk what world he lives in... but I’m pretty sure struggling to clean your arse in the sink takes way longer and more effort than just sitting on the edge of a tub and turning on the bottom stream of water and using exactly like you would with a bidet. \\n\\nI am so angry beyond belief. I don’t even know what to say anymore. \\n\\nHe said sorry again... but at this point....fool me 3+ times - I must be out of my mind to think this is going to get resolved. And if he were actually sorry, and understood the issue, he wouldn’t have done it. \\n\\nEven if he doesn’t understand the problem with it, if we have argued about this and I have asked him not to in my house multiple times - he should just be able to follow directions regardless. \\n\\nI am sure he has done it other times too without my knowledge. \\n\\nPlease tell me if I am overreacting.

We started dating when I was 19, and he was 26. We’d met through a close family friend (his aunt), and at the time we clicked really well, better than anyone else I had ever met. \\nHe and I both live in the South, and we found that we both shared a common distaste for the lifestyle that the families around us loved. I didn’t have plans to get married and pop out kids because I wanted to grow a career first, and he really respected that, in fact praised it. We both have fields in IT, and we shared hobbies of gaming and we had similar senses of dark humor, and I really valued that. \\nA year goes by, and I’m having problems wanting to get intimate with him, but he understands that I’m an anxious person, and he respects my space, and I try to do intimate gestures, even if I’m not ready for sex. I let him watch me shower naked, and occasionally sent nudes. \\nLast summer, we tried more because I could feel the pressure of him expecting after so patiently waiting, so I tried to give him a handjob. And at one point a few weeks later, he tried making out with me and I froze up and had a panic attack. I promised him that I would get therapy to figure out why the fuck I was having such a hard time with it, and I did. \\nI spent the last six months, going through therapy and digging up a lot of possible reasons for it. Terrible sex ed that involved fear mongering, parents that didn’t give me good resources which turned me to porn, bad childhood trauma from a medical incident, and later teen trauma from a stranger online, but ultimately it brought me to realize that I’m not physically attracted to my boyfriend. \\nHe’s not ugly. He generally takes care of himself, and I’ve always sought out the heart more than physical appearances. He’s loving, he’s kind, he’s more than patient. He tries helping me in looking for jobs, he talks about us getting apartments, and he’s been saving for the last two years to send us to Disney. \\nIn the three years we’ve dated, we only had two fights, and both have been caused by myself over silly menial things. So during these six months, I’ve tried to convince myself that I’m being silly, and that I do love him, and every couple goes through a phase of not loving each other, but it’s just not enough. \\nI’ve realized that because I held myself at a low self worth, I might have just settled, but that’s not really important. What is important, is that I’m no longer in love with a boy that has done nothing but worshipped me and been patient with me for the last three years. It’s selfish to waste his time, and to give false hope, or to keep him from someone who really could be THE ONE for him. \\nBecause I’m anxious and I’m always thinking about scenarios of how situations go, I’m terrified that he’s going to think that he’s unattractive, or that he fucked up, or that he’s not good enough for anyone and it’s so not true.

However, about 3 weeks ago he has expressed increasing interest in going to the gun range with me whenever I go to the gun range on the weekends. Before he expressed interest, he would stay home, which he is more than old enough to stay home alone. When he started asking me if he could come, I thought nothing of it because I was the same way when I was his age.\\n\\nA week ago, I noticed that the tumbler on the safe was always in a different position every time I came home from work (My nephew gets home before I do). I felt a little crazy for taking a picture of the tumbler before I left for work but when I came home, it was definitely in a different position. I asked my nephew if he touched the safe and he said no. He responded rather quickly to my question and I had my doubts about his response at first, but I convinced myself that I must have moved it and just didn’t remember doing that, so I moved on for the rest of the day. After I asked him that question, I stopped finding the safe’s tumbler in different positions. Last Friday I called into work and told my boss I was sick, but I left the house the same time my nephew got on the school bus. I drove around the block and waited for the school bus to leave the area and came back to my house. I normally wouldn’t violate a teenager’s privacy by searching their room, but I did exactly that. I found a notebook with a list of combinations that matched the set of possible combinations of my safe. Around 150 combinations were crossed off and yes, I did spot the correct combination on this list of his.\\n\\nI put the notebook back where I found it and left the house and waited until my nephew returned to come home as if I really did go to work that day. Since that day I took inventory of the guns and ammo in the safe and I have been checking it every day. And before you ask why I didn’t just take the notebook away, it’s because I don’t want to wake up with a knife in my chest. Or why didn’t I just lock the tumbler from moving, it’s because I can’t, the safe is very old (I inherited it from my parents) and it was made before they started putting locks on the safe tumblers. The 3 safes in the basement have these locks but not the one in my office. I’m very freaked out by this and have no idea what to do about this. The other 3 safes are full and cannot hold anymore guns or ammo and I have no one that I can trust to give these guns to while my nephew is living with me. And no, I cannot move the safe in my office to the basement because it is too large to fit through the door that goes into the basement.\\n\\nIf there’s anything you think could help stop my nephew, or maybe figure out why he wants to get into that safe, please tell me because I’ve never dealt with something like this.'),\n",

       "  'Obligatory, I’m on mobile, sorry for crappy spelling\\n\\nSo for a bit of context, I’ve known my Friend, K since I was very young, around 10+, I soon after met X, and T. As soon as I went to Secondary school, we were all separated into  different classes,me and X being in NA ,K bring in express,after being in the same class for 3 years. Just for a little context, the way it works where I’m from is basically we have 3 “streams” Express, Normal academic, Normal technical, “best” being first and worst being last. It’s kind of a touchy subject where I’m from so to keep it simple,  when you’re 12 you do a major national exam to decide which stream you go to in secondary school, once you’re in secondary school,if you score poorly in express you go to NA, if you score badly in NA you go NT.  Me and X through out our secondary one were in NA, while my K was in Express, we all looked up to him as he was the only one in our group of friends who we saw wasn’t as dumb as us. \\n\\nOver the course of Sec 1, he failed miserably and went to NA Sec 2, bummer, but it’s ok. So he got put in the same class as X, while I was still in another class. Cut to the present, finally we are all in the same class. He has changed a lot since I last saw him, apparently now smokes, is now best friends with X’s EX, which makes it awkward for all of us. He got so drunk at a party I hosted that he took about a hundred photos of the ceiling fan and was genuinely dying of laughter. Keep in mind we were all underage. He frequently just runs out of his house to go and meet with X’s ex, who we’ll call E, and has driven his divorced mother to call him an embarrassment, and also said that she hates him, promptly kicking him out of the house, to which he doesn’t seem to care all that much, usually returning home after a few days. Immediately afterwards, he just proceeded to go get a drink, and a pack of smokes, and of course meet with E. He milks his Father for money when all he does his yearn for his affection and love. It kills me to see what he’s doing, X insists that I just let it go and let him do whatever he wants, it’s his life after all, but I feel like something has to be done. I’ve known him for a good part of my life and can’t see him suffer with shitty results, living in a shitty house just waiting for his parents to die eventually to get their cash. He wastes his life moping around Void Decks and loitering around smoking in public. He has several police cases and a 6month probation has been turned into a 13 month because of his shitty attitude, and mostly just smoking and barely hiding it. \\n\\nWhat should I do? I’ve tried telling him nicely before but that’s before he got kicked out, and never has he ever shown this little care or concern for his life. He’s my Friend and I want what’s best for him. What should I do to help?'),\n",

I am working as a science teacher - this is my first year, and I have no background in education, student teacher experience, or training. I'm basically an emergency teacher in a state with a teacher crisis.  I have symptoms of mild aspergers, including social difficulty and huge knowledge of specific interests (this is partly why I teach science).  I am currently grieving - my only sibling passed away a year and a half ago in an accident, and that has had a big impact on my life and the way I've chosen to live since then.  I am across the country from home, trying to live completely on my own for the first time. \\n\\nI am smoking (usually vaping) weed almost every day. I have noticed myself building up a tolerance, and I have tried to convince myself to quit a couple of times, but I never do. \\n\\nRight now, I have nothing in my life except work and personal hobbies (learning guitar, video games, tennis/bar trivia with my roommate). I'm told this is pretty standard for over-worked first-year teachers, but until summer I'm trapped in a situation where I have no time or energy for a meaningful social life, dating, or anything like that.  My job is stressful to the extreme - I am terrified of public speaking, and I do it every day. Every day I come home exhausted, and I'm met with boredom or work until I go to bed. Weed is the perfect solution to everything. I feel good when I'm high, my problems seem to fall into perspective, and I feel motivated to work out and practice guitar - two goals I have been putting off for years. \\n\\nI worry that I may be fucking up my brain chemistry. I'm terrified of developing a dopamine problem, which I feel like someone like me is at high risk for. I smoke partly because it makes me feel happy, and using it as a happy pill may really fuck me over in the long run. I am still grieving, and I worry that this may be a bad time to mess with my brain chemistry.  Thing is, I am so desperately bored with my life right now that the thought of quitting now seems really unappealing.  Going a day without weed means having a shittier evening than I would with weed, and despite any desire I have to cut back, when I'm home facing that, I always choose the thing that will allow me to unwind to my fullest. \\n\\nSo, my gamble is to continue smoking almost daily until summer, and then, when I can actually live a life, cut back. Maybe regulate smoking to weekends only, or something like that. I just worry that I may cause damage between now and then.  Am I being irrational?  I know addicts rationalize things like this, and I just want some outside perspective. I feel a lot of guilt about using, and I sometimes have a hard time telling where guilt ends and legitimate concern begins. \\n\\nIt's a long read, but if you made it so far, thanks for your time. Let me know what you think. \\n\\nTL;DR:  I smoke weed more than I feel like I should, but I don't want to stop in the middle of the semester. I'm looking for outside perspective. \"),\n",

Okay. \\n\\nI lost it at the “unreasonable” part. I dealt with a number of improper entries when they were having the whole house painted. I would come home to people in my house, with no notice, having moved around my personal stuff (dirty laundry, bras, prescriptions) when I’m supposed to have 24 hours notice. Or I would come home and they’d taken it upon themselves to lock my dog up for hours without water. I let them remodel the kitchen and ate food from the microwave for 3 weeks. Some major appliances included in my lease (ie. AC, the dryer) have died and I didn’t kick up a stink. I could have gone to our landlord and tenant board and gotten a decent chunk of cash and didn’t, because I like to keep the peace.\\n\\nI listed these to him and he shoved an agreement to end the tenancy at me and tells me I need to sign it today and storms off. \\n\\nI send a massage to my landlord explaining how unfair this was since I was in exams, was only asking for a couple of days, and I could have just said no. \\n\\nShe sends a half hearted apology, says it’s been stressful for them too, and says she still needs the papers signed.\\n\\nI know I could have put my foot down, but I was able to convince a friend to rent out his basement apartment to me cheap. It’s a huge downgrade from my living situation now, but there’s no year-long lease. In my opinion, greed showed their true characters, and I didn’t want to stay anyways, so I texted them that I’d move out.\\n\\nI’m not looking for legal advice. Ironically, I’m a law student who volunteers for legal aid and I know that I could go after them for the above-mentioned incidents. But that’s not really what I’m interested in.\\n\\nI feel like they’re horrible, selfish people, who got off too easy here. Maybe I’m looking for some r/pettyrevenge ideas here, or maybe I’m hoping someone will find the words I want to say to them. But something just isn’t sitting right with me, because I think they believe they acted appropriately and feel like victims of tenant protection laws... because 60 days notice is just so burdensome I guess.\\n\\nAny ideas?\\n'),\n",

At the time, I was maybe 12 or so when her and I started to have a LOT of issues. Looking back at it now (as an elementary teacher and someone who has taken a lot of child development classes) I realized I suffered a lot of abuse from her. She was very mean to me, she would point out my imperfections and she never ever said nice things about me. Instead, she would point out that I had a zit, or say that I needed to lose weight, things like that. She also frequently called me a bitch and said I am disgusting. I would also like to point out the fact I was a teenager, so honestly, I probably did and said things that were mean too, but I NEVER called her names, and always tried to follow the rules she had laid out for me. \\n\\n When I was 14, she threatened to give away her rights as my parent \"unadopt me\", so I actually ran away for a day. Instead of walking into the school, I waited until my adopted dad drove away so that I could go somewhere else. Since it was raining, I basically just stayed in a dumpster all day... I know, it\\'s stupid, I was 14 though and scared at the thought of being abandoned again. Eventually, I came home. Police officers were there, and of course my adopted mom denied her ever saying that to me.\\n\\n That event caused a lot of issues with my parents, which is really sad because I am a HUGE people pleaser. I have always sought ways to show my adopted parents how grateful I am that they adopted me, I always wanted to make them happy and proud of me. I never did drugs, made straight A\\'s, and I didn\\'t even leave the house much as a teenager because my mom would say that me leaving her made her feel \"lonely\" and that she wanted me to stay home. \\n\\nAt the age of 19, I came home from a long 13 hour shift and my dresser was knocked over. My adopted mother said that it wasn\\'t clean enough, and that I needed to fix it right away. THAT was a HUGE game changer for our relationship. For the first time in my life, I unloaded on her. I called  her out for every wrongdoing I could imagine, (which included the fact she sold her wedding ring and went to go live with some guy she met online for a year back when I was 11 years old) . During this argument, my adopted mom was screaming at my adopted dad to come defend her. He didn\\'t budge, and honestly, I believe it\\'s because he knew I was in the right.  I couldn\\'t take it anymore, so I packed up what I could and moved out to live with my boyfriend at the time. \\n\\nFor an entire year, my adopted mother refused to speak to me. During this time, my adopted dad had to meet up with me at restaurants, or have me come to his work in order to visit him. I wasn\\'t allowed to be at the house. After that year was up, my adopted mom decided to let me back into her life. I of course had to apologize for everything, she has never ever taken blame/said sorry to me for anything. \\n\\nA few years went by, and I felt like we had a better relationship, although it felt pretty artificial. I tried my best to never do anything that I knew would upset them, I brought them food and would try my best to make them happy. \\n\\nLet\\'s fast forward to December of 2017 where I am 24 years old. I don\\'t know if you guys have heard of the love languages, but I\\'m pretty sure hers is gift giving. Anyways, that\\'s important because I told her that I didn\\'t really care about the gifts, what I wanted was for us all to relax and just enjoy the holidays. I told her that the way she acts around the holiday season is hostile because she is so stressed, and that I didn\\'t like it. I guess I was hoping for us to work on this, maybe make the holidays better, but NOPE. She told me to never talk to her again. I called her and my adopted dad nonstop for days, and neither of them answered. Eventually, she just blocked my number. After a few months, I quit calling my dad as much. Then, I just quit calling them. I figured ya know what, my mom did this before, so maybe she just needed another year of the silent treatment. I cried about it often and would ask others for advice, but nothing really helped. \\n\\nBecause of this, they missed my graduation with a bachelor\\'s degree. Even though I am the only child to have a degree (in their own family and  with my brother)  they didn\\'t care because I chose to be a teacher. That was something my dad was always mad at me for. He wanted me to be a nurse, or something else that made \"real money\".  They continued to ignore me. In the fall of 2018, I sent them a card. I said sorry again, and updated them on my life. I told them that I loved and missed them (I moved to another state after college) they never responded to the card. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow, just this last month, I finally had the opportunity (due to financial stress) to go back to my hometown. They didn\\'t didn\\'t answer the door. I then sat in my car and called my adopted dad maybe 6 times or so (I had a new number, so he didn\\'t know it was me) he answered the phone, asking who it was. He told me that they are moving to another town and won\\'t  be back for a week. He said that maybe I can see him when I plan on coming back in June. Throughout the conversation, I heard my adopted mom say things like \"don\\'t tell her anything!!!\" in the background,she was very obviously upset he was talking to me. I told my adopted dad that I loved and missed them... maybe 8 times or so, and only said \"ok\" back to it. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAfter that phone call, he never answered the phone again. I recently heard from a family friend that they want nothing to do with me or my brother. So, in short, they have decided to disown us. I have been having a very difficult time accepting this. I think back at the times I was in my room crying, looking at a picture of my biological mom, and my adopted mom would come storming in, ripping up the picture and telling me \"I\\'m your mom now,  get over her!\" just for her to disown me? Why would she do that to me? I don\\'t understand it.  \\n\\nThe conclusion that I have come to is that they adopted us for the money. Apparently, in the state I\\'m from, that got about $500 per kid every month until we turned 18, along with big tax cuts. At the age of 18, my mom did buy me suitcases and told me I should think about moving out soon, so maybe it really was just for the money?  Maybe they tried to  be good people, and that\\'s why they allowed me to be in their life a few years past the age of 18? Maybe they never loved me?\\n\\nIt\\'s also important to note that my brother (the sibling they chose to adopt with me) has also felt this feeling of disconnection, as if they didn\\'t really care much about us, or want to be close to us. Ex: Anytime I was super affectionate, they would act very weird about it and often turn it down and laugh it off, like it was weird or something to them. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy biological mother  (biological dad was murdered) and I have recently started talking a lot more than ever before, so it is nice to have a motherly figure, I really do love her, however I am still deeply hurt from the situation with my adopted parents. I recently realized that I  DO have a pretty great life, I just need to change my mindset in order to enjoy it more. I need to somehow accept the situation with my adopted parents, and learn to trust others again. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHow can I accomplish this?  Should I just focus on my relationship with my biological mom now? How can I accept this abandonment?  I have always thought of my life as an adult with my adopted parents. I envisioned them being proud of me, and helping them in their old age. I didn\\'t take a gap year during college like I wanted to for my adopted parents. I didn\\'t go out and hang out with people as much because it made my adopted mom feel lonely. I didn\\'t wear blue nail polish because my adopted dad hated it (he said it was slutty?lol what). I didn\\'t do drugs, make bad grades, be disrespectful all the time, etc... I feel as if I did everything \"by the book\" in order to be a good daughter. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI know I made my mistakes, but I have heard about way worse scenarios from my friends where their parents forgave them,, and the only thing I can think of is that they don\\'t want me anymore and cannot accept my mistakes because I am their adopted daughter, not biological.  I guess the good thing about this is that the relationship I had with my adopted mother has always been very unhealthy, so it\\'s probably best we don\\'t communicate. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBTW, sorry if me saying \"adopted mom/dad\" was a little much, I am working on disassociating the mom/dad title to them to the best of my abilities because it is helping me cope a little bit. A;lso, in case anyone asks, my adopted dad only yelled at me maybe 2 times and has always been understanding and nice, the polar opposite of my adopted mom. I feel as if he is just doing whatever he can now to make my adopted mom happy, especially because they are older and nobody wants to die alone.'),\n",
       " '9ff34f': (\"How to Handle My Twin's Response to My Infertility\",\n",
       "  'I have an identical twin and we\\'ve been extremely close since, well, the womb. We\\'ve followed different paths over the years  - I\\'m more pragmatic, whereas she is what we jokingly call more \"woo-woo,\" or basically a total hippy. We mostly agree on everything though, and when we don\\'t, it\\'s no big.  \\n\\nFor the last two years my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant, with no luck. We were diagnosed with \"unexplained infertility\" which is maddening in and of itself. It\\'s been hard talking to anyone about it because people who haven\\'t dealt with infertility don\\'t know what to say (I get that). But my sister, after months of not really responding to my spontaneous crying and feelings of frustration, wanted to help last month. So she gave us a \"fertility ceremony,\" where she lit candles and asked us to hold hands and imagine our child and then eat an old orange she brought back from a vacation to Barcelona which signified our fertility (we were only able to get through about half). We weren\\'t asked to speak at all. I felt like she was trying to help us but it really didn\\'t connect for me or my husband-- I would have much preferred her just sitting and asking me questions and being supportive in other ways. But I didn\\'t say anything, just thanked her. \\n\\nThen I recently found out I was just with the wrong fertility doctor for the last 8 months, who didn\\'t order the right tests. Turns out I have cysts on both ovaries (endometriomas) and most likely have stage 4 endometriosis. This dramatically changes what we have to do in order to get pregnant. \\n\\nI immediately call my sister and tell her to get checked out. Our mother had to have a full hysterectomy at 32 because of this disease, and I don\\'t want my sister suddenly getting a cement pelvis or something (really a thing.) She thanks me and we hang up, then a couple hours later she phones and says she spoke to her \"channel\" (read: psychic) who told her that endometriosis is an unexplained disease because it is actually caused by negative or heavy energy that some women carry with them through life. Apparently he told her that my cysts are caused by energy our mother gave to us (had a relatively difficult upbringing, but hardly traumatizing and I get along well with my mom now) and that if I don\\'t \"do the work\" to let go of this energy I may eventually miscarry even if I do end up achieving a pregnancy. \\n\\nThis felt like the last straw. Let me also mention that she bought me a meeting with this \"psychic\" over the phone 18 months ago, who told me that I was going to get pregnant \"very soon.\" Yeah, horseshit. I told her that first of all, either this guy was 100 percent full of crap, or at least as fallible as regular people who are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. Her attitude is that I am allowed to feel how I feel, but she simply doesn\\'t agree, and is working on meditating and focusing on herself as \"whole\" to rid herself of the illness our mother basically gave her. \\n\\n I feel torn. Honestly it feels like I\\'m not even allowed to hold any remotely esoteric beliefs or values because I am constantly on the wrong end of all this juju. Is it wrong to just want my sister\\'s full support, even if I\\'m electing for surgery and potentially IVF, instead of thinking about my mother\\'s mistakes? How do I tell her that we are all doing the \"work\" every day to deal with our pasts, and people who meditate every day don\\'t necessarily always escape heartache or bad energy? How do I fix our relationship before I do get pregnant?'),\n",

And my sexual experience was relegated to just a hand job and foreplay type stuff ( fingering, playing with boobs). I also haven't made out with a girl since my early 20s. Anyway long story short, I recently got a great job and have been getting in better shape, so my confidence and self esteem has risen quite a bit. \\n\\nSo I met this girl, Mildred (26) and we hung out a few times smoking weed.

They don\\'t bother anyone so we never thought it was a problem.\\n\\nWe say hi to each other and i let him walk in front of me, about 15 feet ahead. By the time I get to the door he\\'s holding it open for me. I say thank you and walk through. from behind i hear \"you\\'re welcome, Bibi\" (my name).\\n\\nI\\'ve never told him my name nor have i ever had a conversation with him outside the occasional \"hello\"\\n\\ni kept walking towards the basement doorway into the building and i hear \"hey come here\" i turn around and he\\'s standing by the door motioning for me to come closer to him. I said no and turned back around towards the door and he turns the lights off. I get scared so i walk faster and get to the hallway. I turn around and he\\'s right there. again he says \"come here\" and i say loudly NO I\\'m not going anywhere with you.\\n\\nI run upstairs, make sure he stopped following me and get into my unit.\\n\\nI call my boyfriend who was parking the car right away. He doesn\\'t answer (he hates talking on the phone) so I text him what happened in one sentence. He immediately replies back with \"wym\" I tell him i\\'m scared and the guy knew my name. again he says \"wym\" and i ask him to call me; he texts back \"whats up?\"\\n\\nI\\'m shaking by the time he walks through the door. I go to him and im trying not to cry because i know he hates that. And tell him again what happened.\\n\\nHe asks if the guy touched me. i said no but that was because i got away - \"why didn\\'t you answer your phone?\" i asked. He then said \"well i dont know what you expect me to do about it\".\\n\\nI then start crying because for me, it was really scary. A guy doesn\\'t turn off the lights when he\\'s alone in a basement with a woman for good intentions. I ask him if he could talk to the guy and make sure he doesn\\'t bother me again. My BF says that the guy\\'s probably gone (it had only been about 5 minutes ago) and my bf\\'s not gonna go down there and look for him.\\n\\nI didnt want to put my boyfriend in danger by sending him down there so i didnt want to push it but this is the same bf who a week ago was willing to drive 2 hours away to fight someone who was talking shit about his car online.\\n\\nso i got upset and mentioned that and asked why he was acting so non chalant and it seemed like he didnt care. he got annoyed and defensive and said \"no one said they didnt care you\\'re just being emotional for no reason. stop crying you\\'re almost 30 you\\'re all over the place and i really don\\'t know why you\\'d call me or what you expect me to do. if youre really scared just call the police\"\\n\\nso i walked away and called the police while i heard him turn the TV on.\\n\\nI tried to ask him after I got off the phone and the day after why he didn\\'t care more about this and why he didnt do anything and all i got in response was an eye roll and \"idk idk idk, what is it that you want from this conversation\"\\n\\nam i in the wrong? was i overreacting since the homeless guy didn\\'t actually touch me? is it wrong to have expected my boyfriend to do something about? How can I get him to understand why this is so upsetting to me, both the situation and his reaction? Is it worth breaking up over after almost 3 years together?\\n\\nTL;DR: homeless guy knew my name and tried to corner me in my apartment building\\'s basement in the dark.

We have lived together our entire lifes, but I feel like I don\\'t know him and I don\\'t want to. For some reason he HATES me. He has no friends, spends all his free time in his room playing videogames. At home he either ignores me completly (I do too now) or he insults me randomly for no reason. I am literally his target. It\\'s his hobby to destroy my life I swear to you guys. He LOVES to see me cry and whenever he spots me crying (which I always try to hide since it\\'s a little embarassing) he goes to my parents and makes fun of me because I\\'m crying. Even when it\\'s about serious stuff. Let me give you an expample of how twisted he is. Once when I was about 12 I hit my head and bled a lot at our school. I had to be escorted to the school nurse and obviously I was crying. Randombly my brother and his friends (this was back when he actually had any) were in that area and when he saw me crying, bleeding from my head, surrounded by worried classmates and teachers, he started laughing and making fun of me (for all he knew I could have been dying btw, it was quite serious). \\n\\nHe gets mad REALLy easily and has these tantrums if I say something slightly provocative. I have to be really careful around him because we have had physical fights before. He has called my names for the smallest thing like \"Pig\", \"whore\", \"idiot\" ect, and here is the weirdest part: whenever I try return whatever insult he has thrown at me he runs to our mom and tells on me immediatly as if he didn\\'t just call me the same thing. It\\'s mental. Whenever I confront him and say that he literally just insulted me he lies and acts like that never happened. He will defend things that he just did right before me ON HIS LIFE. Even if it\\'s just the two of us present. And he will protect his dumb lies no matter what and I mean it. Exmple from when he were 13: He once wasn\\'t supposed to play any games on his computer (to cure his addiction which he has to this day), but he did and i caught him. I told my dad about it and my brother wouldn\\'t admit to be doing that even though his pc was running soundwise and was warm underneath which is proof that he was indeed using his pc. He SWORE that he didn\\'t use it and it got to the point that my father smashed the pc and threw it out the window. (yeah the situation was that tense) He could have just told the truth and it wouldn\\'t be a problem at all. If he had just admitted to using it, it wouldn\\'t be a problem at all, but he repeatedly denied using it and ended up making one of the biggest quarrels in my family. \\n\\nHe is my moms best friend and he is disqustingly fake-nice towards her. He uses artificial charm at everyone he meets and he\\'s really socialy awkward. He doesn\\'t quite know how to talk to people and he is overly well-behaved I guess. He behaves how he thinks people want him to but he\\'s overly formal and tried to manipulate them into liking him. \\n\\nOk this has been really badly structured and my english skills aren\\'t the greatest but I want your opinion on this. Is he a psychopath? I tried hinting at it to my mom once and she got really defensive and mad at me, but I feel like she knows that something\\'s wrong with him. She just doesn\\'t want to admit it.

At the time I was hired another guy who was in the same position was hired as well, both of us casuals. We weren’t ever really close but we got to know each other quite well since being hired at the same time. Fast forward a year and his sister was hired to work on the registers. When I first met her she was super nice and pretty cute but I didn’t want to pursue anything because she was still in school (although only 2 years younger than me) and was my co-workers sister. That was that, we always had normal chats, she constantly asked me how I put up with her brother. I remember one night when the store was being remodelled we had to park our cars across the road because the usual staff car park was being demolished and built over. Managers always made sure we left in couples or groups and never alone because the area is very shady and after dark it just isn’t fun to be around alone. Anyway we walked to our cars just us two and chatted along the way, not sure why I remember that moment specifically but it was nice just to chat.\\n\\nThis continued for a very long time and I was fine with it, never thought about being anything other than friends. I always thought that she had stronger feelings for me, but now I’m not sure and I’m seconding guessing myself about this but at the time when we spoke to each other I always thought to myself that she might have had stronger feelings.\\n\\nFor some reason just recently (let’s say sometime in the last 2 or so months) I was talking to her on a tea break and something just clicked, I don’t know what it was but suddenly I knew that I wanted to be more than friends. Usually with these sorts of things anxiety gets the better of me and I always think that I’m not good enough for someone and I talk myself out of it, at first that’s what I did but I’d try and force myself to shut those thoughts out asap. I’ve always hated work and I’ve been trying to get out but all of a sudden I was looking forward to work, the opportunity to see her again and to just talk to her. I work Monday and Friday nights and all day on Sundays, she works Friday nights and all day Sunday as well, so we’d time our breaks to coincide with each other. Because of the way timetables are scheduled differently between produce and front end I’d always start either 15 or 30 minutes before her and I made it a habit to be stocking the front tables when she started so I got to see her walk in and say hi.\\n\\nBefore working last night (Friday night) I told myself I was going to ask her if she wanted to grab a coffee on Sunday during our tea breaks. Usually this kind of thing makes me beyond nervous and stressed but this time I just felt so confident, I was ready. So we go on our breaks last night and the idea was to ask if she was working Sunday then see if she’d be interested in grabbing a coffee. So I asked,\\n\\n“You working on Sunday?”\\n\\nShe suddenly got visibly uncomfortable and told me that no she isn’t working because she’s going to Europe to visit some family for a bit then she’s doing a Contiki tour for 6 weeks. My stomach sank and immediately I felt sick, she had never mentioned this up until now. My mind suddenly thought she must be quitting, I won’t see her again, 6 weeks is so long. We talked about it for a while and as we were heading back to work I asked her if she’ll be coming back after 6 weeks. She stopped and told me that she is rostered to return and hasn’t quit but while she is over there she’ll be looking for a job and would stay if something we’re to come up. Since then I’ve felt empty and alone, I didn’t even get to say goodbye because she wasn’t around when I was leaving. I can’t sleep because I can’t stop thinking about her, food taste like nothing, and I want to cry. I need to talk to someone but I don’t feel like there is anyone I can speak to in this moment. Even now I’m writing this paragraph with tears slowly dripping down my cheeks. I don’t know what to do. I have work in the morning and it’s the last place I want to be.\\n\\nI’m angry at myself for leaving it so long before pursuing anything, and even angrier that I’m letting it affect me so much. I’m just praying that in 6 weeks time I’ll see her walk into work again. Otherwise I have nothing to look forward to. What do I do if she stays in Europe?

       "  \"So I'm not really sure why I'm posting this other than I felt like I wanted to say this. So here we go.\\n\\nI just broke up with my fiancee. We had been dating for six years, we actually had our anniversary. We met each other when she was still in high school, and I had just graduated. She had her own charm and personality that I really enjoyed. But quickly she began a gradual shift, resulting her interests resulting largely in her loving all the things I love. It was almost her personal identity began to mimic mine. I know people say that when your in a relationship that you begin to share the interests, but this was completely one sided. My interests didn't revert but she just went head first right into mine. Back then I was a bit more immature and I was psyched and didn't see this was even occurring. So first question here, is it a bad  thing this happened? Should I make an effort to never have this occur again?\\n\\nSo we spent alot of time together, it was great but after about three years she got, for lack of a better description mean. She just got really pessimistic, and insulting. It was to the point that my friends and family started to say stuff to me about it. I don't want to give off the wrong impression, I didn't just knuckle under and accept it, it was the subject of many fights between us. This aggressive behavior continued up until the end. Also it wasn't aggressive all the time, some times she was sweet, and funny, and I loved being around her at this time. But as time went on the amount of time she was like this diminished to the point it was a rarity. \\n\\nFor the actual breakup, we at this point have both graduated from college, had long term plans for moving to another part of the country/world. But this just kept causing fights, and at this time I think I was more or less conditioned to it and didn't really even know how much we were fighting. Finally it got to the point we both realized we were not happy here. She kept saying that we love each other but don't like each other, I kept asserting that I did like her but not when she was more or less cruel. We mutually decided that we should split up but she couldn't move out yet so we began alternating sleeping on the couch. We were civil here, I told her I would help her any way I can, and I really do/did want her to just be happy. \\n\\nBut during this week we were living together but broken up, she absolutely changed. It was she was the best of what anybody possibly could ever be. It made me feel inspired, courageous, and like I couldn't be troubled by anything. On day three we started to sleep together again. By day 6 I had to let her know, the person she was, what she I can see she could be, it was absolutely worth fighting for. And I meant it. I wanted this, I wanted her. So I told her exactly how I feel, and voiced my concerns about her descending back into the same behavior. We then decided to give ourselves a three month trial to see if we really could be the best for each other.\\n\\nIt lasted four days before she went back into the same behavior. I just couldn't believe the situation. I felt cheated by life, that someone could be so good but then just fucking suck so hard at other times. I wasn't fair that I couldn't be with her, the best of her. We talked again... \\n\\nThis time around I was mad. I made it clear this was what was going on, and voiced my dissatisfaction. She said we grew up, and realized we didn't like the same things, that she wanted to be a different person. (She met some new friends through work that 'alcohol enthusiasts' and like going to bars all the time, and staying out until 3am). She wanted to party like a kid who was a freshman in college, and I've grown beyond that. I'm an adult, I don't want to an immature kid again, I worked very hard through college so I could have a good life, and not have to struggle. I worked hard for the both of us, supporting her through school so she could put her best foot forward, and then she wanted to tear it all down because she liked to go drinking, and partying with her new friends.    \\n\\nI couldn't stand it, I told her I was leaving her. She moved into her friends how that night. She is still coming around, and moving the remainder of her stuff, plus she had some pets she can't take and I don't have the heart to force them out so she is coming over and taking care of them until a good home can be found. Do you think this is a good idea? Us being in such good contact, being civil, and trying to do things like this to make each others lives easier even though we broke up? \\n\\nAs well do you think breaking up was even the right call? I love her I really fucking do. But how can I be happy with that kind of toxicity? \\n\\nAnother thing I need to confess here. After we broke up I started talking to another girl I know. Shes cute, and funny. I'm pretty sure she is interested, but when weighing my options for my relationship, when I visualized her there. Not because I feel anything for her, but it was almost like I was planning my contingency. Is that a fucked up thing to do? \\n\\nLastly I can't objectively define my own behavior and I'm sure she would paint a different story for this reason as well, but am I toxic here too? Or did I make her like that and not even realize it? Is this my fault?\"),\n",

       "  'I’ll try and make this brief and to the point. (TL:DR at the bottom) Starting junior year of high school, I ended up falling in love with this girl (we’ll call her Hannah), more than anyone I had ever met before. I didn’t think she liked me at all, but she confessed mutual feelings for me  at our senior prom. It felt so surreal, and it was the happiest I had been in a long time. \\n\\nAccording to Hannah, she had liked me for around the same time as I liked her, despite having a serious boyfriend and a couple flings in between that time. I shrugged it off due to the surge of emotions I had when I was around her. However, a week after that night at prom, she abruptly called off the building relationship. She said she wasn’t quite over her boyfriend of the serious relationship, of course I understood, he wasn’t the best person after all. Although I was hurt, I subconsciously prepared in case nothing ever came of the two of us, that way we could remain friends; feelings aside, we were great as friends, and that seemed like the least damaging route. Nothing I could have assumed would’ve led to what happened. My friend told me (later confirmed by Hannah herself) that a day before she called off our relationship, she slept with a person she had barely become friends with. I was devastated, but decided it would be best to forgive and forget, since at the time, Hannah wasn’t aware that I knew, and wouldn’t learn of my knowledge until just before we stopped talking.\\n\\nThe next 4-5 months consisted of me being a stepping stone to her to try and prove my worth. I told myself time and time again that she wasn’t worth my time, but I would do the same thing I’ve been doing since we split up; forgive and forget. I even paid for her concert tickets when my friend bailed on me, just to have her drag me to hang out with her friends that also went. I’m sure that if they didn’t leave early, I wouldn’t have spent any time with her all night. The worst instance I can remember is after not talking for almost a month after the concert, she texted me trying to pick her up 30 minutes away from my house and take her to a job interview, and when I said I couldn’t, she made me feel like a horrible person. She tried to apologize to me later, but still ended up getting angry at me.\\n\\nThis all ended when an old friend of mine (we’ll call her Lindsey) and I had a really rough falling out, and Hannah took her side. Now she didn’t explicitly tell me she took Lindsey’s side, but I think blocking me abruptly on every platform  sent the message pretty clear, especially when I keep hearing how close they are through mutual friends.\\n\\nI’m better off without her in my life, that I know for sure, but even 8 months after I last spoke to her, a one week relationship fucked me up more than any person or pain could’ve caused. I’ve been fine the last couple months or so, but I heard she got a new boyfriend, and I’ve been constantly doubting my own ability to be a good future boyfriend or even a friend in general. I wanna be there for everyone in my life but I can’t be there for myself. I’m sorry for the long story, but it brings me to the advice I need. How can I help myself move on from her and build my self confidence back up?\\n\\nTL:DR I was in love with a girl for 2 years, was in a short lived relationship with her, then found out she slept with a guy before ending it with me.

I am an empath and I really have very few meaningful relationships, so when I find one and put time/effort into said relationships I tend to have a harder time letting them go, because it's hard to find people to connect to. Jane lives close by and we live in a small town. She constantly makes me feel used by only coming over to smoke weed (that she isn't allowed to do at her house) and then immediately leaves. Example: shows up at 11pm, leaves by 12:30am and usually leaves me questioning myself, my sanity or our relationship. This happens almost nightly. She randomly comes over, sometimes uninvited and berates all my friends. One time Jane told me she thought I had schizophrenia, and then left me alone by myself for three hours. She belittles me and everyone around her, it's a complete drag; On a positive note Jane is constantly giving gifts that she has paid for and accumulated through subscriptions (she has a total of 6 different ones) she just uses as gifts. They're all super expensive, she is extremely wealthy in my small town and she always makes sure you and everyone else in the room knows it, but acts like she isn't. She is constantly rude to me. We have on and off fights usually about me talking to other people. She will get super mad and tell me who I should and shouldn't spend my time with, but then when you criticize her or who she spends her time with she cuts you off. Blocks you completely on social media... So nothing usually gets resolved. Because you're too scared to get cut off. ( life is a lot harder when she is mad at you) so I guess what I'm asking is how can it be a clean break? She does really toxic things like tell people lies about you and talk straight mad shit about you to those who's opinions matter to you and then they get upset with you and it is super messy and toxic. I feel like I'm drowning in her web of negativity... She always wants to show you stuff but shits on everything you recommend / tell her you enjoy.

I’ve been working at my current job for six years. I enjoy the work, the pay is pretty good, and I have benefits plus time off which is great. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe problem I’m having is with one of my co-workers, who is a massively toxic and all-around garbage person. He’s been with the company for over 20 years and is great at his job. On top of that there have been numerous complaints about him and despite this, he’s never come close to being fired. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe things he says go beyond being inappropriate and while I’ve tried to deal with it, I just can’t anymore. I’ve tried ignoring him, standing up for myself, “giving him a taste of his own medicine” – nothing works. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI work at the location he’s in three days a week (location A) and another location he’s not in two days a week (location B). Three days may not seem so bad, but we’re all closely clustered together in an open office with no barriers or cubical dividers, so I can see and hear him the entire 10-12hr workday (he’s so close I can easily hand him a piece of paper without leaving my chair).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI definitely don’t have thick skin (not for a lack of trying) and I have terrible anxiety that I’m taking medication and seeing a doctor for. Being around him and dealing with his toxic attitude and comments honestly drain me. While he does it to everyone, I’d say 60% are directed towards me (regarding my weight, religion, age difference, etc.) and I just can’t take it anymore. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI frequently have to excuse myself to go in the bathroom to cry and by the time I get home I’m so miserable I don’t enjoy myself at all. I’ve even started becoming sick prior to leaving my house in the morning when I have to work at the location he’s in.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow, location B is wonderful. Even though the commute is twice as long, the people are fantastic and I can get so much more done because I’m not feeling terrible the entire day. I do have specific duties when I’m at location A, but during my last review my boss spoke to me about giving me more responsibilities and removing some of the duties I have at that location. I’ve also spoken to the manager at location B (he originally trained me when I first started and we have a great relationship) and he said he’d be more than happy to have me there five days a week instead of two. So that’s not an issue.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat I’m worried might be an issue is that this has happened before with another co-worker two years ago. He was actually fired for the harassment (it was myself and two other girls), but when it was happening I put in a request to work at location B full time and it was denied. I don’t want to go to my boss with this and have her think that I’m a pansy who can’t handle myself. I can take a joke and I have a good sense of humor, but what he says just goes beyond what is appropriate.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo.. is talking to my boss a good idea? If so, how do I phrase it? I don’t want her to think I’m weak because I can’t handle a shitty co-worker (after all, I’m not at work to make friends or be happy). I was thinking of talking to her about the issues I’m experiencing and then mentioning my desire to have more responsibilities like we spoke about and how moving into location B might be a better opportunity for me? Do I mention my medical issues with the anxiety when/if I speak to her?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLooking for a new job would probably be the easiest thing for most people but unfortunately my finances are very tight right now and I would be unable to find a job with similar pay and benefits (I only know because I’ve been actively looking and even went on several interviews). :(\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you so much in advance! :)'),\n",

       "  'For context I’m a female in my early 20s. This is long-ish, but I need advice TL;DR at the end.\\n\\nAbout two years ago, I went through a rough breakup. I didn’t handle it well, but overall I’ve lived a very sheltered life, so I didn’t get “wild”, but I tried going out and socially drinking on weekends like other people my age. Around this time I got a message from a photographer I had modeled for when I was preteen and he was early 20s. He was in town for a video project, wanted to grab dinner and catch up, and see if I could help with the project.\\n\\nWe both had wine at dinner and I was completely wasted on two glasses of wine (my guess is that something was added). I wanted to go home, so I called an Uber. He said he’d walk me and wait with me, but then he also got in the car. At this point I was uneasy, but too out of it to protest much, and he said he was just “getting me home safe” and then he’d get a ride to his hotel.\\n\\nThat’s not what happened. He “helped” me inside, but then he started getting undressed. At this point I’m baffled, and starting to black out. I’ll save the graphic details, but after what seemed like forever he got off of me and I passed out. \\n\\nI woke up on the floor in the morning, and he was still there in my bed, awake. He just watched me as I stumbled to the bathroom. I thought I would die with how bad my head was pounding, but I was unsure if it was a dream since I couldn’t feel the rest of the pain in my body. I sat in the bathroom a while with the shower running, eventually he knocked said he had to leave, I said bye. Eventually, I showered and noticed that my toe was broken, then I noticed bruising, handprints and tenderness internally and externally.\\n\\nA week later he called to yell at me on voicemail that I gave him an STD (spoiler: I already tested clean). I told him over text I didn’t and that I didn’t appreciate his tone and didn’t want to talk to him again. And that was that... until recently, he messaged again.\\n\\nI realized I had not dated anyone, or slept with anyone since then, and even though I buried the memory it was still affecting how I felt about sex/men. Now I’m dealing with the torrent of emotions, that I had not processed before. Mostly unexpectedly, this includes a fear of authoritative/fatherly men. I suppose it makes sense since we only had a professional working relationship while I was a child, and though he was young, he was still an adult with authority over me. What’s more is that I can’t get over the creep factor of him likely finding me attractive as a child, who posed in swimsuits in front of him (we hadn’t kept in contact between then and the incident). I’ve become a recluse, and haven’t talked to my dad or grandpa in over a year even though I was very close to them before. I humiliated, ashamed, scared, paranoid and sad.\\n\\nWhat do I do next? How do I move on? Why won’t he leave me alone? \\n\\nTL;DR: Childhood “authority” figure takes advantage of me in adulthood, now I’m skittish around men, especially authoritative/older ones.'),\n",

       "  'I\\'m 17 and I made a really bad decision. I actually and legitimately fell in love with someone, someone who I thought felt the same way. We dated for a little less than a year and then she came out as gay and it kinda broke me in two. Then she told me that she was sick of all the rumors going around and that I should tell people the truth when they ask me why we broke up. So I did and she has no recollection that she ever said that, and has refused to acknowledge my existence for the last 3 months for outing her (her life is fine I should add, she got lots of support when she came out and those people all hate me now...). People weren\\'t exactly surprised seeing as she shaved her head and dyed her hair purple and started holding hands with her new girlfriend in public... and yes she accused me of being the one to out her AFTER this happened.\\n\\nSo basically... I\\'m on summer vacation right now and I have a month until I go back for my final year of high school. And I\\'m really really scared. Being in the same room as her makes me want to actually die because honestly, I still care about her kind of a lot and she hates my guts. She also makes a point of socially ostracizing me and just... watching her be popular and loved while I\\'m in a social gutter of being \"that asshole who outed \\\\[girls name\\\\]\" is just a little bit too much for me. Her replacing me with a new girlfriend is a bit too much for me. I totally respect her sexuality and her right to not want to be with me, thats not what this is about. Its about that I just want to be able to be in a room with her and not want to burst into tears. I want to not spend my summer vacation dreading seeing her. I want to not miss her because she was my best and only real friend. If I could, I would just never see her again but I don\\'t have that option.

I don\\'t know what\\'s up but I thought I should go get it checked out. \\n\\nI am in her office and she comes in and I start telling her what\\'s going on. She proceeds to ask me questions on whether I\\'m allergic to any medications, if I use any tobacco products, if I drink and if I use marijuana. I tell her I\\'m not allergic, I don\\'t use any sort of tobacco, Ive never been a fan of drinking but I do smoke marijuana. Being from Texas it is illegal but she is my doctor so I wanted to be honest with her. I am 22 years old, I go to school full time and I\\'m also a manager at a local restaurant so I don\\'t really have time to smoke all day. It\\'s also kind of a bigger risk than what it\\'s worth so I don\\'t go too crazy with it. I\\'m also a really anxious person. Like I just always feel on edge so it\\'s good for me after a long day. My dad takes all sorts of medication for his anxiety and depression issues but I just couldn\\'t see myself using antidepressants unless I desperately need them.\\n\\nI told her, \"I don\\'t use it all the time. I am honestly a really busy person so I don\\'t have time to really sit around and smoke all day.\" \\nShe looks at me and replies with, \"yeah not yet I guess.\" \\nI was pretty alarmed by what she said so I told her that I personally know a lot of people who use marijuana for more than just to sit around and do nothing. Of course there are people who smoke weed all day and sit around and bum but there also are a lot of people like myself who just use it as something to let off stress at the end of a day. \\nShe just kind of laughs and turns away from me. She then asks me more questions on my eating habits on whether I eat breakfast or not, which I don\\'t. I wake up at around 9 and go to class until 10 when I go to work and I\\'ll eat food there when I get off. We talk a little more and she recommends this Ensure drink and also to \\'cut out all extra activities that aren\\'t beneficial to your health\\'. \\nThis is when I start to get a little agitated. I explain that I wouldn\\'t have even said anything if she hadn\\'t have been my doctor and I had thought she could assess my situation better. I told her that I\\'m an anxious person and to even tell her that I used it in the first place was uncomfortable for me. I don\\'t want to be labeled as a \\'stoner\\' or a \\'pothead\\' so I don\\'t like going around telling everyone how often I use it. As I\\'m telling her all of this stuff my hands literally start sweating and my leg starts shaking. At this point all I can think of is uncomfortable this is that I\\'m even having this argument with my doctor, of all people.\\nI can tell she\\'s getting defensive because I\\'m not just agreeing with what she\\'s telling me and she says that I don\\'t have a \\'sense of reality\\' out of nowhere. I didn\\'t know what she meant by it because it was so random. She just replied and said, \"you\\'re coming here to me to find out what is wrong and you\\'re getting offended when I tell you what my opinion is on it.\" \\nI honestly was about to have a panic attack in there because I\\'m not going to have a full blown argument with my doctor in her office.

       "  'TLDR: I helped my friend get an alternate phone when hsi parents took his phone away about two years ago. I forgot about it. His parents found out recently and I regret it but I don\\'t know how to proceed. \\n\\nAbout two years ago, I made a new friend. We got along instantly and I was excited because, being a more emotional guy, I tend to get along better with girls so having a guy friend I clicked with was cool. I was 19 and he was 17.\\n\\nWhen I met his family, I could instantly feel his parents helicoptering. Nevertheless, they seemed to like me and I ended up getting along with them as well. \\n\\n A few months go by and even thuugh I like the parents as friends, as parents, they\\'re really overbearing. Both parents had a wild youth with lots of drugs etc. and seem to assume that all young people are gonna be crazy like they were. In addition, the dad seemed to have some permanent damage from the drugs. \\n\\nMy friend would get in trouble for seemingly minor things but then his dad would extrapolate it into a huge explanation as to why that minor thing is actually really important. The saying \"strict parents create sneaky kids\" proved to he true. They care but the harder they squeeze, the harder their two sons try to escape; the younger one, by challenging authority head on and the older one, my friend, by going behind their backs. Which makes the parents squeeze harder which makes the kids rebel more. It\\'s a cycle.\\n\\nI didn\\'t appreciate it at first, but my family is relatively well adjusted. I never felt smothered and we never really had any problems so the times I got in trouble were few and far between. So when my friend first got in trouble, it seemed like a big deal but it turns out it was the norm in that family. I wanted to sit down and try to explain or just get them to talk to each other but my friend was convinced that they\\'d never see his point of view and I agree now.\\n\\nSo at some point, he got his phone taken away for like the third time. I decided to let him borrow an old ipod I had which is like a smart phone without the calling and texting. A bit later his parents got a notification that my friend logged into a new device with his email and he made up some story so they wouldn\\'t suspect. He texted me about it in case they asked me. I expressed my distaste for lying to his parents. I told him that the reason his parents don\\'t trust him, is because he isn\\'t hienst with them. He laughed it off and even thuugh I didn\\'t like it, I went along with it.\\n\\nAbout a year or two passes by. He and I grew apart. I forgot about the whole thing. Even though I still consider him a friend, we haven\\'t hung out in awhile. I actually talked more with his parents here and there because, like I said, when they\\'re not being parents, they\\'re pretty cool people.\\n\\nYesterday, I saw them at a party and they brought up the ipod they found out about recently. I\\'d totally forgotten about that. I didn\\'t know what to say and they said to think about it and that we didn\\'t have to talk now. So I sat with a knot in my stomach the rest of the party.\\n\\nThey\\'re still overbearing, but that doesn\\'t make what I did right. And getting to know my friend more, I understand why they\\'re so paranoid about him. I feel really bad because I hurt my friends. I hate that idk if they\\'ll trust me again and honestly idk if they should. I regret it but I don\\'t know if I\\'d do anything differently given the opportunity. My current friends don\\'t seem to go behind their parents backs or they\\'re old enough to have more autonomy.\\n\\nI honestly don\\'t know what I\\'m looking for. I\\'ve almost managed to get through the period of feeling sorry for myself so I can think straight. Am I a bad person? I don\\'t know how to proceed.

If you are cheated on, the person who swore to stay with you made a deliberate decision to not stay faithful to you, drunk or not they should know the difference between right and wrong. And I can NOT STAND women or men who do not have enough respect for themselves to realize that that person is toxic and will only hurt you more in the long run. This is my personal stance, and I've told all of my family and friend's this from the start and that it is not acceptable in my life because that person is deemed untrustworthy from that point.\\n\\nMy friend, let's call her Patricia, has just found a new guy who she had been excited about him 'treating her right' and all that. Months pass and he starts saying how he's questioning their relationship and doesn't know if he is ready for it. She thinks it's basically over and yada yada. Our group consoles her, tells her she'll be okay. A day later she tells us all he cheated. He had texted a friend of his and said gross things like 'Hey I got really fire p***y last night and it wasn't Patricia's'. His friend then told Patricia, which is how she found out   \\n\\nBeing the person I am with the morals I have, which she is very aware of, I freak out, I'm sending her videos telling her she doesn't deserve this because she's awesome, and I wish I could hug her and tell her she shouldn't have to do this (Again, she's been cheated on before and left the dude). \\n\\nThis just in, as I was talking to her and trying to cheer her up, I get the text saying she took him back because he told her everything that happened front to back and said that the girl took advantage of him. Even though he BRAGGED about it to a friend. Drunk or not, no person who was taken advantage of would brag about cheating on someone they were apparently in love with. \\n\\nI've been in contact with Patricia since he cheated and when she sent the message saying that she took him back yesterday night, I was going to reply telling her a repeat of my morals and why that doesn't fly and how I can not support the relationship she is trying to hold on to, I stopped myself, deleted it all and have not talked to her since. I don't know what to say because she 100% doesn't have any type of my support, I would like to not lose her as one of my bestest friends, but it's hard because this is such a high moral of mine. \\n\\nMostly I don't know what I should reply to her text. I don't know if I should ignore the relationship, tell her I can't support it, cut her out (which I really don't want to do) \\n\\nDISCLAIMER:\\n  I do realize it's not my life or my relationship.

In fact, no one seems to know how to fix it with current technology.  Thus, all the little widgets may never fully function.  When someone asked the CEO why they kept telling everyone the master widget would be done and then it never came about, the CEO just said \"I was just being optimistic!\"  or \"I must be bad with dates!\"   Sales of tiny widgets continue online and the company is doing well, all based on the promise of the master widget coming in to save the day and activate all the tiny widgets.  Right now, they are pretty paperweights (essentially).  \\n\\nThe other issue is that the CEO dispatches news releases constantly and continues to add features lists to the master widget.  At this time I think it can cure cancer!  (haha, but not far from the truth)  So, tiny widget sales stay steady based on the promise of the release of this magical master widget (we see a nice hop in sales after each news release).   Also, the CEO must personally approve every tiny widget design.  Very micro managing.  If it does not meet CEO\\'s standards, it will be scrapped and redesigned from the ground up.  We have hundreds of tiny widgets (probably thousands in the wild), and no master widget to bring it all home.  Yet, like clockwork, the CEO releases an update and says the master widget will be out by the first quarter.  No, the second quarter... no, by end of year, oh and now it will do dishes!!!  Rinse repeat for 5 years.  We might be 5-10&amp;#37; complete, per the programmers, maybe less.\\n\\nShouldn\\'t a manager know what his team is up to and when a realistic release date would look like?  Why would the CEO do this?  Is this optimism or incompetence?    Knowing the master widget is barely functioning and years of development and R&amp;D will be required for it to even do 50&amp;#37; of what CEO promised, what am I to think?  Is the CEO lying to continue to sell tiny widgets and can I, knowing this, be implicated in all of this (if it is a crime)?  Money isn\\'t an issue for the company at large, the idea is really amazing, but the reality is that the master widget is just... well... not a reality.  I have full confidence everyone thought it COULD be done 5 years ago when it all started. Optimism was high!  Now, I don\\'t know if anyone still thinks that, at least, not in the next 5 years.  We are all kind of nervous now.\\n\\nJust looking for opinions and advice, thanks!  :('),\n",

I also tend to grow distant from my friends when in a relationship, and I got married about 2 years ago.\\n\\n I thought I was feeling shame/guilt/loss for my current situation, but now I think maybe it's just society's pressure to have friends that has me feeling that way? I am 27, happily married, a home owner, and comfortable with money. Currently taking time to save/travel before my husband and I truly settle down and have kids. I fear that I can't relate to people my age. They're all looking for love or working on their careers or trying to find themselves or being a carpool parent or hustling to afford rent. Aside from this friend problem, I really have no problems, nothing to vent or relate about. The idea of getting drunk and staying out late like I did just a few years ago is very unappealing now, but so is getting coffee in the morning or doing yoga or getting brunch. Socializing feels like a task, I have one good friend who I enjoy talking to but everyone else I keep up with is just out of the fear of being isolated.\\n\\nAre social networks making me feel shame for something I truly don't care about right now? I have to admit, seeing past friends post pictures with tons of other friends gives me a little pang of shame. My husband also has a LOT of friends, which makes me feel like a reject for having only 1 or 2. In the future when we do have children, I hope to know the neighbors wherever we move and the other moms at school and form friendships with people who have things in common with me, people to 'do life with'. Right now, I feel like there is no one that is on the same page as me enough to truly do life with me, besides my husband.

       "  'Probably a long one ahead. I don\\'t have anybody else to talk to about this so I\\'m coming to you guys. It\\'s mostly to do with a girl.\\n\\n**Background:**\\n\\nI started working with this girl, I\\'ll call her Emma, who\\'s my age and in her mid twenties. That was last summer in 2017. Now, she has a bit of a history. Married twice. Both of them left her for shitty reasons. She\\'s got a few mental illnesses. Used to be a druggie but got clean before she got pregnant. Oh yeah and she has a toddler. She\\'s the type of girl that I\\'m usually not interested in because I can see the heart break coming a mile away, not to mention that most people see me as a sheltered guy that wouldn\\'t mesh with that personality.\\n\\nI\\'m actually a virgin. I had a girlfriend in high school but we never got to actually having sex because she wanted to wait. Everything since then hasn\\'t lasted more than a month or two and usually ends with her leaving me after several dates because I was just supposed to be a rebound. I also didn\\'t start drinking till I was about 18. Never did anything harder than weed and even that wasn\\'t until recently, and I don\\'t plan on doing it again because I want to become a cop after college which means no drugs. So I\\'m a little sheltered maybe. But I\\'ve had more than my fair share of hardships in life. Dad died when I was 12, grandad when I was 19. My sister is a narcissist. I was bullied growing up. I\\'ve never had a real best friend that I could be completely open with and trust to be there for me. I\\'m halfway suicidal (never attempted but definitely contemplated, more so recently). I\\'m pretty sure I deal with depression, I\\'m trying to get that confirmed by a therapist here at some point. and I\\'ve basically been alone through it all and ever since.\\n\\nSo Emma and I started talking a little and hit it off enough that we were sort of seeing each other for about 2 months. Now, since I\\'m a virgin we never did anymore than handsy makeout sessions for those 2 months we were talking. Which was mostly down to the fact that I have no fucking clue what I\\'m doing and don\\'t know when to start heading for the bedroom. She was coming clean off her last divorce when we met so she was still kind of fucked up and really just looking for a rebound. But she acted like she wanted a boyfriend despite the fact that she stated otherwise so I just went along with it.\\n\\nThings didn\\'t go well. A \"friend\" of mine, we\\'ll call Dick, got involved, I got squeezed out because of Dick\\'s chemistry with her and she stopped confiding in me. I found out she was talking to other guys and going on dates, which I assumed anyway so I didn\\'t freak out about it. But eventually she told me she wanted to stop the physical stuff and just be friends. I got angry and confronted her about how we weren\\'t really friends because she only talked to Dick (I later found out he was actually trying to get a threesome going between her and his girlfriend of 7 ish years, which I don\\'t believe ever happened). I was pissed that she was treating me like she wanted a boyfriend while also pushing me away, lying to my face about dating other guys, and trying to get into a relationship, just not with me. I didn\\'t end up telling her any of that, and we wound up being assholes to each other for the next 4 or 5 months.\\n\\nWhile Emma and I had a dislike for each other, Dick would sometimes fill me in on Emma despite me not asking, so he told me about how she was seeing some guy, we\\'ll call Steve. Steve was married with 2 kids, a cop and volunteer SWAT officer, had money, and was good looking. He ended up blocking her on social media because his wife found out and I figured that was the end of that.\\n\\n**Fast Forward to Now:**\\n\\nDick wound up pissing off Emma and they\\'re no longer friends. I got tired of being angry all the fucking time since I see Emma at work a lot and just decided to let things sort of happen the way they we\\'re gonna happen. Her and I are flirty friends and now I\\'m one of the only people she has that she can count on and vice versa. She\\'s been in an off and on relationship with Steve who\\'s only now getting divorced 10 months after he and Emma started talking because his wife got tired of his shit and is trying to take everything he has. Emma made some intimate mistakes with her best friend recently that ruined her friendship with him, so they don\\'t talk anymore and she felt guilty about it because she\\'s technically seeing Steve still. So now I\\'m really her closest friend apart from Steve.\\n\\nEmma and Steve are working things out while he gets divorced. I\\'m depressed and trying to rely on Emma to help me as a friend because I don\\'t have anyone else who gives a shit. She only helps so much though because she still has her kid to take care of and is made happy by Steve in a way that I can\\'t. I\\'m just not a priority. So I\\'ve been trying to manage on my own, figuring out why I feel like shit, and I figure that it\\'s because I still have feelings for Emma. Problem is, she\\'s in love with Steve. I\\'ve also worked out that Steve is actually the guy she started seeing behind my back and left me for. When they started talking, he lied and said he was separated from his wife which he was very much not. So now I\\'m pissed off again, because now I\\'m remembering all the shitty things she did to me leading up to her leaving me and how Steve played into it and how she said she didn\\'t want a relationship but ended up in a 10 month thing with Steve, and now she won\\'t leave him since he\\'s getting divorced, they finally have a real chance, and he needs her help to get through it all. She knows I don\\'t like Steve but I still try to support it because he makes her happy. Which pisses me off more that he does and I don\\'t.\\n\\n**Advice:**\\n\\nSo here\\'s where I need help. I\\'m falling apart. I don\\'t have anybody else to confide in but Emma who I have a lot of feelings for still, but Emma only wants Steve. Steve doesn\\'t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon unless he fucks up again. Which he\\'s fucked up a lot and Emma still loves him, so it would take a monumental fuck up at this point. I\\'m heartbroken over how things went between Emma and me, I also can\\'t forgive her for the way she handled it. I haven\\'t told her any of this stuff because I\\'m afraid doing that means the end of our friendship, which I still value since I don\\'t have anybody else. No one else in my life knows what I deal with. No one else knows that I think about suicide. Everyone I\\'ve ever tried to come to for help just kind of brushes it off and goes on with their life. I feel worthless. I feel intensely alone and have lost hope that that\\'s ever gonna change. Emma cares as much as she can, which isn\\'t as much as I need but is still more than anybody else ever has.\\n\\nI want to tell her. I wanna get it off my chest because seeing her with him pisses me off so much. Knowing that he\\'s a lying prick and that he got away with it while I\\'m left here with nothing makes me so angry because I\\'ve never had anything, while he comes from a decent family, has a good career, has (had) a wife, kids etc. Emma constantly says I\\'m a great guy and she doesn\\'t understand how I\\'m a virgin. That I\\'m attractive. I don\\'t know how I still am either except that maybe I\\'m a little bit shallow/picky and am severely lacking in self-esteem, but I just wanna confront her about it since she had the choice and chose him. I want to tell her that the reason I\\'m falling apart is because of our unresolved issues. Maybe ripping off the bandaid and cutting her off as a friend would be best for me, but I still have to work with her. I would still have to see her, she would still accept me as her friend because she doesn\\'t have anyone other than Steve at this point and she\\'s also borderline suicidal, and I wouldn\\'t be able to stay away because I have feelings for her and care about her. I don\\'t want to see her get hurt or hurt herself. I just want to be furious right now. I want to have it out with Emma. I don\\'t want to lose her though because I like having her as a friend, and I still feel that if Steve ever leaves then her and I might still have something.\\n\\nIf you read all that you\\'re a saint and I appreciate you. Normally I\\'d just suck it up and have the conversation with her and cut her out of my life. I\\'ve done that before so being in this situation now and reading through all of it makes me feel embarrassed that I can\\'t just do it, but I\\'ve also never been this good of friends with somebody that I used to have a thing with, who I still have feelings for. I know it\\'s manipulative to be her friend all while hoping her and I get back together some day, but part of me still just wants to bite my tongue and try to move on while staying friends. Am I wrong for feeling this way and for being angry? What do I do?'),\n",

They never noticed me open the door but I saw that they were naked, and one was on top of the other. I couldn’t see exactly what was going because of the way they were angled but I assume they were kissing or whatever.

He is much like the Devil I guess you could say. The main character who is almost as ancient as the evil king embark on his journey at the age of 21.

There is more to this but for the sake of protecting my idea this is all I am going to share. \\n\\nOption 1): start with the very beginning: before I start with the actual story I tell the story of the past that explains why the world is the way it is and how the armies came to be. Also explains the main characters back story\\n\\nOption 2): just jump right in on the action: start the story showing a citizen in distress and being attacked by monsters and when cornered the main character appears from nowhere and saves the citizen all while displaying his power. By doing this I demonstrate the strength of the main character and the power he holds. Then he goes about his day and narrates what the world's current conditions is in (the story of how the world came to this predicament is not told here but at a later point in the story.)\\n\\nOption 3: neither: tell me what you think I should do to start the story instead.

       "  'Hi everyone! \\n\\nI started dating this guy about a year ago. He is genuinely the most incredible person I\\'ve ever met - supportive, caring, funny, smart, all around a wonderful person. At least, I think so. \\n\\nMy friends on the other hand, cannot stand him. They think he\\'s rude because he doesn\\'t say hello when he comes over, I spend too much time with him (granted we spend a lot of time together, but it\\'s not like I don\\'t see/make time for my friends), he disrespects their culture (because he listens to rap music and wears a gold chain? If someone could explain this to me, that would be great), and they just generally don\\'t like him. They\\'ve never straight up admitted that they don\\'t, but they have made it clear that he is not someone they would choose to associate with. \\n\\nThey\\'ve talked to me multiple times about how I put my relationship before them and the things I have done wrong since we have started dating - not answering texts as often as I used to, always being out with him, etc. I\\'ve apologized and worked on it, but every month or so they\\'re upset about something else I\\'m doing in regards to him. I try and fix it, but it\\'s hard feeling like I have to walk on eggshells to make sure they\\'re happy with the way I\\'m running my relationship (and life). I avoid talking about him with them, so I don\\'t give them any reason to critique our relationship (I understand friends are supposed to point out when something is wrong, but he\\'s genuinely a good boyfriend - I wouldn\\'t hide abusive behavior if that EVER became an issue, but I avoid mentioning when he didn\\'t pick me up until 15 minutes after we planned because it would result in a \"he doesn\\'t respect your time\" conversation...does that make sense?)\\n\\nMy boyfriend doesn\\'t try much to get along with them, either. When we first started dating, he overheard them saying some not-so-nice things about me and our relationship. At the time he told me, I never confronted them about it because I was worried they wouldn\\'t have owned up to it and it would have turned into a \"you believe him over us, your friends for 3 years.\" I figured it would just blow over and all of them would just be civil around each other if the relationship continued - I was wrong. It seems wrong to bring it up now, considering I\\'ve known this is why he hasn\\'t liked them the entirety of our relationship.\\n\\nThe only times all of us have hung out, it\\'s been awkward and uncomfortable for everyone. Either my friends and I are talking and he\\'s left out or my friends are talking to each other, I\\'m talking to my boyfriend, and no conversations are intertwined. My friends have expressed to me that they don\\'t like the tension and don\\'t know where it stems from (they don\\'t know he overheard them talking junk, he was outside their bedroom waiting for me). I dealt with it for the past year, but now my friends and I will be roommates and I cannot deal with getting dirty looks whenever I say he\\'s coming over or that I\\'m going out on a date. It\\'s exhausting. They know he\\'s not going anywhere and he knows they\\'re not, either.\\n\\nI\\'ve talked to my mom about it and she says my friends find reasons to not like him because he takes time that used to be solely \"reserved\" for them, which results in them spending less time with me. Granted, it\\'s true, but I\\'m so much happier now. I still make time for them and we still see each other (almost) everyday. \\n\\nThey don\\'t want to talk about it all together either. Each of them knows the other doesn\\'t like them. My boyfriend knows why my friends aren\\'t fond of him, my friends don\\'t know why he doesn\\'t like them (pretty sure they think it\\'s a race thing, which isn\\'t the case - he just doesn\\'t like people talking behind others backs). \\n\\nI have introduced my boyfriend to many other friends and almost all my family, so I know it\\'s not that he\\'s a bad person and I\\'m just \"blinded\" by love. I\\'ve told the situation to other friends outside our circle (besides the part about him hearing them talk junk) and they say they\\'re just jealous or need to get a grip on reality because he is not doing anything wrong - you do not *need* to say hi to someone if they don\\'t say hi first (even in their own home), he isn\\'t rude when they\\'re around (just doesn\\'t talk to them), and he makes me happy. I\\'m not talking bad about him to them or them to him, so there\\'s no reason I should feel so \"in the middle.\"  \\n\\nI guess the advice I\\'m looking for isn\\'t so much \"what advice can you give me to fix this\" (because I don\\'t think anything will fix it) but more so, \"what advice can you give me to cope with the situation?\" I\\'ve told them I don\\'t want to be put in the middle and not to talk about each other to me (since I\\'m just going to stick up for the person who isn\\'t there), but it still comes up way too often for me. I don\\'t know how I\\'m going to deal with living with my friends when I want my boyfriend to come over 3-4 nights a week (I can\\'t sleep at his place because I have my dog and his unit isn\\'t pet friendly). Any help/advice would be appreciated because I\\'m drowning right now.\\n\\nThank you all in advance.'),\n",

We don't know how many more there were.  He moved away to a state that doesn't require him to register, although I called and told the local police about him anyway.  They thanked me but couldn't make him register in his new state because his conviction occured before Megan's Law was enacted. He's been married before and she had a boy and girl (not his) who were 7 and 12 when we met her.  We told his then wife what he was and she said that god has forgiven him and she wasn't worried.  After she left him, we dont know why, he moved to another state that doesn't require him to register.   Again, I called his local police department and they didn't care.

They never applied for visas or anything. To my knowledge they came to the united states illegally. They both separated in 2008 and have been living apart since then. My dad has been supporting myself, my sister(20 F), and my mom for 10 years now. My mom has been riding this wave since then and has not worked since I was a young boy. Currently, my mom lives with my sister and it has been tense for a while. That itself could take up a huge post. My sister is currently in this state of annoyance with my mother. My mom is the type of mother who likes things a certain way and often gets offended when criticized. I love her but I understand the annoyance. My sister is also in school and living off my mom's cooking, cleaning, and money. They are in this state of relationship where I could very well see them separating as well. My mom is a good person and does love the both of us. I love her too. She has suffered a lot of trauma from the relationship she has had with my father. She still receives the money in order to live and he gives it out of duty. Its a fucked situation. I stopped receiving his money but my sister is using it in order to go to school and pay for rent. My dad has been talking about moving back to Mexico which means money will be gone soon enough. He is such a flakey person that I think it will come sooner than later. My sister has not worked a job yet and my mom can't really work without the fear of being deported. My dad does give a shit. I am fearful of what will happen to my mother if he does leave and stop paying for everything. My mom is under the illusion that she will have money still and that my dad owes her everything he does, which he does. The world unfortunately is filled with this justice so she probably won't get a dime when he leaves. My sister can fend for herself. I am confident in her ability to find a job and be okay. My mom is in her 40's and does speak english fluently but has been able to understand what is being said. Her last job was in 2002 I think. She is amazing cook and loves to help the community. She goes to the food pantry anytime she can even if it is an hour away. I am recently married and live in a one bedroom apartment and can't house her.

Barely talked to or engaged with his family. I have barely talked to him for 5 years. Of course random daily stuff like can I borrow your car, did you walk the dog, etc. Occasionally I ask him questions about things he knows (computers, math etc.) But pretty much no casual conversation.\\n\\n\\\\- He's now in university studying a STEM major with decent grades. He still has no friends, plays video games a lot but nowhere near as much as before. He seems interested in improving himself; he studies a lot, cooks healthy food sometimes, walks our dog and teaches him tricks.\\n\\nAs he is now he won't be able to live independently after university and get a job, apartment, get friends, socialize, get a girlfriend/wife/family etc.\\n\\nMe and the rest of our family are supportive but it seems like my parents are afraid to talk about him not having friends etc., talk to him about it. It's very possible that he has Aspergers/Autism. Now that I write this I can't believe we haven't done anything drastic as a family in the last 5 years to help him. I'm ashamed in myself and my parents for not having the courage to bring it up and just dancing around the problem for so long.\\n\\nWhat should I do? Talk to my parents about it first I guess. Then what? And what can I do for him personally? I could ask him to start working out with me so he has something to do or invite him to hang out with my friends (But I'm 95% sure he'd say no because he'd perceive it as condescending.)\"),\n",

And every gooddamn time the principal ensured us, everything would be okay.\\n\\nThen last summer happened. \\n\\nIn my GF\\'s class (12/13 year old) was a group of 5 girls we just called \"them bitches\" because they were a nasty bunch and bullied a girl into the ground because their families had a feud with the victim\\'s family for years (and worse, they were even encouraged by their parents). My GF did what teachers do and stood up for the bully victim because, you know, 5 or more versus 1. The parents did not like that one bit and started an anti-campaign against her and wrote a five-page-letter to the principal on what she apparently did \"wrong\" during these 2 years she had the class. Many things were ridiculous and so stupid or stuff that was so long back, it technically couldn\\'t matter anymore. Plus: One week after the letter the class would be leaving primary school and they wouldn\\'t see her ever again, but assholes gotta be assholes.\\n\\nThe principal got the letter and ignored it. Not in the \"thank you for your letter, I will look into it\"-way, but completely ignored it. Not even answered that he got it. Three times they sent the letter and got completely ignored. Understandable they went one step higher to the \"Geschäftsleitung Schule\" which is the guy who is responsible for multiple schools in the same district - almost like a CEO.\\nHe ignored them as well in the very same way, not even answering (he does that all the time to the teachers as well...)\\n\\nNow, I hate those families with a burning passion, but I do understand that after being ignored for months they went to the \"Schulpflege\", which is kind of like the board of education in our region. Basically they are the guys who decide the important things for school, are responsible for hiring teachers and make the big decision like budget and thing. They of course asked why the hell they were ignored and what was going on.\\n\\nIt could have been so easy. It could have been so goddamn easy. The only thing the Principal and the CEO had to say was: \"Sorry, we were overwhelmed with work, our bad. We will look into it.\"\\nBut no, they had to throw my GF under the bus and put her on a pedestal in a bad way and force her to get a work coach (yeah, according to our contract you can do this...) combined with a LUDICROUS amount of extra-work (difficult to explain if you are not a teacher) which almost drove her into burn-out and depression just to distract from the fact that they screwed up. They did the same thing to multiple other teachers, the tactic of \". Yes, I know, I am biased and I have to state, that I am completely unable to be unbiased at this point, because of my GF.\\n\\nIn the same meeting the forced her to accept this (in hindsight we should have quit on the spot) they also told her that my unpaid vacation was being granted whilst hers was being denied because it would have \"interfered with her work coach\". Mind you that our vacation was due in 4 months.\\n\\nSo apparently our boss lied to us the whole time when we asked him for a whole year if our vacation was okay and he just sat on his ass did nothing because he couldn\\'t be arsed. Of course we were so stupid to have no written conversation about this because we trusted him.\\n\\nSo we had to cancel everything, lost several thousand franks because of this and to top it all off now we have lodgers in our appartement who were supposed to stay there from last june to july of this year to look after our cats while we are gone. They also owe me, at the time of writing, about 7200 swiss franks. Lodgers\\' rights in Switzerland are ridicoulously unfair for landlords and it is basically nigh to impossible to throw someone out of the appartement even if they owe you money (I\\'m serious. You can as a hobo just walk into an uninhabited building, do drugs and shit and there are still laws that prohibit the police on dragging you out).\\nThis means that we have a family of four non-paying indians in our home we can\\'t get rid of and we fear that they will just stay when the contract has ended in July. It\\'s a beautiful appartement and we will not leave because of them, I will and cannot do that.\\n\\nMy mental health has deteriorated in the last 2 years because of the constant stress, planning and dissappointment. I feel constantly on edge because there are people in my home - our home - which don\\'t go away. My GF and I have quit our job and will leave in summer. This is also a huge loss for me, because I though at the very same school I went to in my home town and have very fond memory of. Now this memory has been tainted.\\n\\nI feel the stress everywhere: I don\\'t really want sex anymore - not because of her, she is the same goddess when I met her - but I simply don\\'t have the energy for it. I coerce myself into sleeping with her and take a really long time to get into it.\\n\\nI have no energy left for anything. I just want to be in peace, be left alone for 2-3 months and only talk to people when I have to. More and more smaller things get on my nerves: The way a particular student talks, the fact when a door is left open, the moment when I cannot get just 20 minutes of peace in recess, the fact that I have to meet strangers and converse with them for two hours...everything mundane takes its toll from me and leaves me without any energy for my most important thing: My relation to my girlfriend.\\n\\nNext august is a big question mark. She wants to go away for a whole year and - of course - go with me. I can\\'t, I simply can\\'t. I get panic attacks even thinking about doing this. Why? Because there will be no security. The flat will be filled with the stupid lodgers, potentially, we would be without a salary for a year and my flat costs 2000 Swiss francs per month. Nothing would be secured, noone would be really looking after our cats (which mean the world to me for reasons only pet owners can understand) and we\\'d potentially be in big debt coming back.\\n\\nAfter 3 years of anxious glooming and dreading I just want to have a year of certainty. The problem is not finding a job, there are way too few teachers everywhere. I just want a year in which I go to work and in my freetime I can go after my hobbies in peace and go out with my love. I simply couldn\\'t stand another year of this \"what-if-and-what-will\". I know it would destroy me.\\n\\nBut on the other side I have to stay loyal to my GF. She wanted to do this since she was 18. I want to support her, I want to be by her side, I want to stay with her and enjoy life, but although it\\'d mean the world to her, I have this blockade in me and can\\'t just \"go away\" for a year. \\n\\nMy parents have argued with eachother for as long as I knew. Although never violently, everyday our house had this toxic atmosphere and resentment towards eachother, mainly because of things that happened way early in their relationship at times when - in the eyes of the other - they didn\\'t stand loyal and didn\\'t support the other.\\n\\nThis is the biggest fear I have, that it will break us. We have discussed this: Maybe I\\'ll stay in switzerland and work and visit her during my holidays, maybe I\\'ll come with her, but neither is \"good\" for the other.\\n\\nThe point where definitive decisions have to be made crawl closer and closer and my anxiety grows everyday.\\n\\nPlease give me your advice.\\n'),\n",

I’m quite an affectionate person so I hug my friends when greeting them and saying goodbye and we tell each other that we love one another and such.

Today they placed bets that she wouldn’t be able to last a whole class without talking to me, or looking at me. I’m regretting so much coming out because maybe they wouldn’t be saying that we’re fucking if they thought I was straight? It’s making my BF feel like shit because she has a girlfriend already! They also said to her today that we had to admit our feelings to one another, like wtf my BF is family, I don’t fucking fancy her because I like girls as well as boys.

But I really doubt that he wants us to be divided into religions and that he doesn’t care what religion anyone is. \\nThe Mormon Church teaches that there’s a whole process for the afterlife. You go to either Paradise, or the Spirit Prison where you are to repent for your sins and learn about the gospel. After that there are two resurrections, one that seems to be better than the second one. And then Satan will be let go and then he’ll be locked up again. \\n\\nThe Mormon Church also teaches that only members of the church go to this Paradise. That is so unfair. Since the moment that was told to me I started doubting the teachings. \\n\\nIt feels confusing. It doesn’t feel good. The reason I am still in the church is because I fear what will happen in the afterlife if I leave. If you’re atheist, cut me some slack, it will seem ridiculous to you but I actually believe in an afterlife, so don’t judge or laugh at this, please. \\n\\nI would also really appreciate if you did not call this religion a cult, as true as it may seem to you I would very much appreciate it. \\n\\nMy mother left the religion some time ago, and my father was very sad. He doesn’t admit it but this devastated him. He wants to avoid the same thing happening to me. My dad is very proud of me and he loves me very much, he’s always supportive of my decisions except for any that go against the church, such as not going to Mutuals or not wanting to go one day. One of his main worries is that I, one day, will leave the church. He is happier in the church and the church has helped him a lot in his life. Had he not joined the church, we probably would not be where we are now. I’m afraid of my life being completely ruined because I left the church. Because I stopped paying tithing. Because I stopped believing in some of the views that the church taught. \\n\\nSo one day, I thought, what if no religions are true? What if all of them have an element of truth in them? And something just clicked... something just made sense. \\n\\nIn every religion, many base their truths off of being blessed by God by praying and following the religion. \\n\\nBut what if the only thing needed is to be a good person overall?\\n\\nWhy would homosexuality be a sin, if it’s not destructive? Sure if all were homosexual the human race would be extinct but guess what, not everyone is. In fact there’s not as much as people think. \\n\\nWhy would drinking coffee be such a bad thing? It’s addictive, but the internet’s addictive too and we don’t see that being a sin. We don’t see food being a sin. Essentially anything can be addictive. \\n\\nWhy, if the gospel never changes, did it change in 1978?\\n\\nThere’s a lot of why’s all over the place. But I’m still confused. What if we don’t know the answer and we will know it afterwards? What if it actually is Satan who’s giving me these ideas so that I’ll leave the church and ruin my life? What if I do leave the church, and my father becomes disappointed with me? What if I become more of a jerk after leaving? \\n\\nI need some advice as to what to do. I’ve prayed and waited for an answer. I’ve done everything according to what the church leaders advised and still no answer. Confusion. Fear. Desperation.\\n\\nIf I ask atheists, they’ll tell me to either leave the church or to just do what I feel is right. \\nIf I ask non mormons, I’ll be told to do what I feel is right. \\nIf I ask anti-mormons, I’ll be told to leave. \\nIf I ask mormons, I’ll be told to stay in the church and that Satan is tempting me. \\n\\nI just wish I could get a yes or a no... \\n\\nTL;DR\\nI want to leave the Mormon Church because I am starting to doubt a lot of it.

It takes about three seconds for them to IMMEDIATELY start walking towards us (four lane street) and at a damn quick pace. \\n\\nI’m not paranoid and I’m street smart enough to know what’s up when every alarm in my head starts going off at the same time at max volume. So I instantly tell me coworkers to get to their cars as fast as they can, sprint to mine, and proceed to grab my S&amp;W MP shield 9mm with a full clip of +P hollow point ammunition and put a round in the chamber so fast it would make their heads spin.\\n\\nNow my female coworker got the message and saw what was going on, so she made it to her car pretty fast, got in and left. My other coworker got in his car and turned his Brights on as he was facing their direction.  And I stand there with my pistol in my hand. And as the three get closer I see a shiny metal bar like object in the front guys hand. And as they got closer I saw that it was a knife. \\n\\nAs far as I’m concerned that’s enough of a reason for me to start lining up a shot, and as I’m raising my gun and preparing to tell them to immediately back away or face the consequences, one of the guys on the side notices and instantly stops his friends and they start backing up and duck off behind some of the stores across the street. \\n\\nI informed my coworker of the extent of the situation and we both left and didn’t stop to give them the tail lights. \\n\\nI don’t regret my decisions and if it had come down to it I would have unloaded into them without hesitation or remorse.

She keeps saying \"you have your money now!!! it\\'s time for you to get out and stop living under my roof!!!\" and yes I know, even though she\\'s not obligated to still be taking care of me... it\\'s still barely been a month of adjusting and her whole demeanor towards me has changed.

       "  \"TL;DR at the end\\n\\nHi, all. Brief summary: I'm 21 years old male and I study in a public college. To enter a public college, you have to work really hard. The competition is INSANE and those that want the hardest of courses have to study in an asian level. Anyway, I got into one and was quite happy.\\n\\nI always heard public colleges were a little bad in the structure side of things, but mine is just terrible. In my course, we frequently don't have classes, teachers don't go to work because of ''personal problems'' all the time and this goes on. I didn't care (much) at first, until I got an internship ready for me because of my grades. Then a girl at my class just decided to have sex with the teacher so that she could have the internship and she got it.\\n\\nThis was the turning point in my faith in public colleges. It was said since high schools that public colleges were like this, that it ''prepares'' you ''better'' for the work market and I just decided to swallow it. But when things like that happens, the perspective changes.\\n\\nFirst of all, I NEVER liked my course (Railroad engineering). i never liked the subjects. Never. But ''for money'', I could endure thos terrible classes (when I had then). \\n\\nThe thing is, the classes were so few and far between that I decided to start Production Engineering in a private college. And maybe I should regret this decision, since I don't feel like going to my public college at all. Besides having classes EVERY DAY (this may sound mundane to you, but to me?), I already got an internship to me and I'm doing tons and tons of outside courses to improve my curriculum, all of those provided by the so called ''bad'' private college.\\n\\nWith that said, the easy course of action was to drop out of the public college for good, but I can't do that. I still don't pay my bills, so I'm not the owner of my life. Mother (who I love very much) don't want me to leave. But I talked to her and we decided to just press the ''pause buttom''.\\n\\nBut here comes the real problem that motivated me to ask this sub for advice. She told me that I should complete this semester first. And I can't. I intentionally missed some classes that I just couldn't care about (my will to study is the complete opposite in the private college). For those, I'm done. But there 2 or 3 that I can complete, but I also don't feel like doing this. I thought I was just lazy (or maybe I am?), but why do I feel like studying for the other college and not this one? \\n\\nYou know the feeling of ''I just want to GET OUT of here''? That's what I'm feeling right now. But I also don't feel like just dropping it like this. But at the same time I just want to get away from all that crap. Do you see what I mean here?\\n\\nMany things block my way of going there to finish those subjects, like someone mugging me with a gun INSIDE the building (funny story, we have supreme gun control in this country), getting there and the teachers just decide to not work because of ''personal problems'' (in fact, I was supposed to be there right now, but the teacher had to ''do'' something and was ''busy'' today)...\\n\\nI'm sorry, do you see what I mean?\\n\\nTL;DR: Have the option to leave a shitty college to focus on the good one. But at the same time, I don't wan't to simply leave. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I feel like just throwing everything through the window because I just can't stand that place.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or want me to clarify something (this has 99% chance of happening lol), just ask!\"),\n",

I am 21 and he is 31...He was a very calm person last year and would respect people of different race however, he had some problems and now he has turned into a racist person with extreme anger issues with extremely low tolerance. \\nIf I just happened to be standing in his way, for example, I am standing next to the tv and he has to walk past me, he gets so angry and is like moovvee!!! Also he is a fast driver so when we go out and some car is in front of him, he gets so angry and screams \"MOVE YOU FUCKING MORON!\" even though some of them are on the actual speed limit.\\nIf we go somewhere, lets say a pizza hut in a mall, and the person taking out order tells him oh sorry we don\\'t have that particular thing, he gets so annoyed at the person and makes angry faces at them. Like come on! Its not their fault that they don\\'t have it wtf! they are just responsible for taking orders.. and he flips out on them by saying \"YOU DONT EVEN HAVE THE BASICS!\" and just walks away. Similarly, this one time we went to a bar and he asked the person working there if they have live music and the guy was like no we don\\'t have them here and then my boyfriend was like \"You do last time I came u had them here\" and the guy was like idk sir but we don\\'t have them. And my boyfriend got annoyed and said \"So you don\\'t have them today?\" and he replied \"No\" and my boyfriend just stormed out of the bar. When I talked to him about this he said \"He was making me out as a dumb person. I have been there before I know they have it and he was like no! I felt like saying to him I am probably more educated than you\"\\nThis is not true. The guy at the bar probably was new and was told that they have no live music nights there. There is no reason to flip out on someone like that. This is also why I am scared of introducing him to my friends at times, because he has zero tolerance and may end up saying some shit.\\nwhat really upset me was when he flipped out on my dad a little. Family is important to me. I would never even think about being horrible to his mom.\\nThis one time he came to stay with my parents for three days. His flight back was at 9 am but my father thought it was 5 am and he insisted to drop him off at the airport, my dad thought it was 7 am so he came and woke him up at 5:30 am and instead of just telling him nicely that he has time, he just said in an anger tone \"Its 5 am! What are you doing I am going back to sleep!\" and that really pissed me off and made me sad. Even though I didn\\'t talk to him about it. \\nI have no problem with him flipping out on people who are rude to him but he does it to people aren\\'t clear with their message. Like we like in a foreign country, people speak a different language here so its understandable if sometimes they struggle to explain something in English.. And if he isn\\'t able to understand them he flips out.. Instead of just saying \"Sorry, come again?\" \\nThe good things about him is that he is willing to always be there for me and if I have any issue, he would call me up and talk with me about it for hours. I am a student so sometimes I cant really afford going to places with him but he pays for me always and never lets me spend anything on him. Since I recently moved out, I am still learning stuff like ironing and washing. But when I go to meet him, he always tells me to hand in my clothes and he would do it for me. He even makes food for me whenever I come to visit and if I have any issue at all with university or anything. he is always there to help me out.  '),\n",

If everything goes well I’m supposed to graduate in May 2020. After graduation my mother expects me to move back in with her to help her take care of my siblings and help her get a house. As far as my siblings: two are boys, aged 10 and 7 and one is my sister (18) who has severe cerebral palsy. We have to do pretty much everything for her.\\n\\nAnyway, after I move back in, my mother plans on divorcing my stepdad and kicking him out.  She wants me to help her get a house by putting my name on the lease along with hers. I honestly don’t know what that means, but my therapist told me that I shouldn’t have to do this if I’m being coerced by mom mother. \\n\\nThe problem is, I don’t want to move back with my mother. I have so much freedom where I currently live (with my aunt) and I just don’t want to be forced to move back. I love my siblings, but as the oldest of 4 I’ve spent a good portion of high school and my young adulthood taking care of them. During high school, my mom would work until the late evening and it was my responsibility to feed my siblings and take care of them and get them ready for school the next day. And as the big sister, I realize this is my job but I’m so tired of it. I want freedom. I feel like I missed out on so much growing up because of my siblings. And I understand this isn’t their fault, but it’s not mine either. They aren’t my kids.\\n\\nMy mom and I have an okay relationship but we just can’t talk about anything. No matter what the issue is, she’s right and I’m wrong. I’ve brought up my concerns in the past but it always ends up with me being called selfish. My mom has told me that since I don’t wanna help, I’m free to “exile myself from the family”.\\n\\nI don’t have a problem with helping, my problem is that I’m pretty much the second mother for my family at 21 and I don’t want to be, I don’t believe this is fair. They aren’t my kids and I didn’t choose to have them. I can’t work as many hours because of my family obligations, I can’t do things with friends because of my family obligations, I feel like I can’t be an independent adult because of my family.\\n\\nI really need advice. After I graduate I was going to get a full time job and save up money (by continuing to live with my aunt) and get my own place and go from there. But if I tell my mom that, she’ll just freak out and tell me why that’s a bad idea. Is it my responsibility to help out my family while also sacrificing my own sanity and happiness? I’m worried that if I tell my mom all of this, she’ll completely cut me off. Not in the monetary way since she doesn’t pay for anything, but in the family support sense. \\n\\nI realize sacrifice is a part of family, but how much is too much???'),\n",

I’ll keep the story as short as possible.  \\n\\nI’m married to a wonderful guy and we have an 8 year old daughter.  We both work outside the home, but I’m the breadwinner of the household. As he is in a mostly freelance business.  We’re both fine with this... it is what it is and typical for our professions.  Not super relevant, but provides a bit of perspective to our story. \\n\\nRecently, my father- in-law has fallen ill.  He has had heart issues for a while and is now in advanced heart failure.  He has recently had a LVAD surgery to extend his life as much as possible. ( for those of you not familiar, an LVAD is basically a pump typically given to those awaiting a heart transplant.  My FIL isn’t a candidate for a transplant, so this is the best they can do.)\\n\\nMy MIL also has some heart issues...she had a heart attack last fall but has since bern given a clean bill of health.  She also no longer drives.  (She can, just isn’t comfortable with it.). My in-laws are still married and live close to us.  My bro and sis in law live out of state, so most of the help my in laws need around the house falls on my husband. \\n\\nMy FIL has been in the hospital for 3 weeks after his LVAD surgery.  Since MIL doesn’t drive, my husband also drives her back and forth from the hospital.  Between work, family and the new responsibility of being his parents’ caretaker, my husband is absolutely exhausted.  \\n\\nIt’s also important to mention that my husband has a great relationship with his father.  It pains both of us to see him having these health issues.  The MIL is a slightly different story.  She’s difficult, co-dependent and passive aggressive.  It was manageable at one point, but gotten increasingly difficult as she’s gotten older.  She also refuses to leave/sell their house and move into an assisted living facility or to even downsize to a smaller place.  Staying in their house is the only option in her mind.\\n\\nJust today, my in-laws approached my husband with a plan for once my FIL gets released from the hospital...they will pay him to be their caretaker.  Which is fine in and of itself, but he would have to cut his projects/hours to do so.  The money they proposed isn’t bad...comparable to his freelance jobs, actually.  But the money isn’t the issue.  Im concerned with the emotional toll it would take on my husband.  He’s not professionally qualified to be a caretaker for a sick person., so Its not in my in- laws best interest either. Im also concerned that boundaries won’t be respected by his mother.  \\n\\nAs you can tell, I am very against this idea.  Mostly because of the reasons listed above, but for other reasons. \\n \\nI have voiced my concerns to my husband.  He understands but he thinks there might not be an option.  Am I a jerk for thinking this is a bad idea?  Has anyone else been in this situation and has advice on how to move forward?  I realize I might just need to let this play out and there’s not a lot I can do, but any advice is greatly appreciated!'),\n",

At the same time, though, her friends keep texting  me saying that she’s lying and that I’m a horrible person. At this point I start to think that my friend is just being nice and that she really just hates me, after all, this wouldn’t be the first time. Another day goes by and I tell my friend that her friends are harassing me with texts telling me to never talk to her again and she basically told me “they didn’t mean it.” At this point they have taken my already low self esteem and ran it into the ground, I’ve been missing activities I’ve been looking forward to because I’m scared that her friends will be there. When I tell my friend this and tell her that this isn’t ok, she just said there’s nothing I can do. The next day things get even worse, my friend and I agree that we shouldn’t talk to each other for the rest of the year and that “maybe we can text over the summer.” I thought that this would finally put an end to this but it didn’t.

My mom sold her and wanted a smaller, cuter puppy, and she bought one and is refusing to tell me where my old dog is. So, I’ve been looking for her everywhere. So far, I’ve tried to extract info from everyone around me, contacted most vets in my country (with more on the list to call), filed my dog as missing with her chip number and some details, and I’ve still got more to do. \\n\\n\\nOf course, I still have this new puppy to take care of, almost exclusively by myself. Just like I did with my old dog, since my family had nothing to do with raising it. Though, they do want to play with this cute lil pup sometimes, something they never did with our old dog.\\n\\nAnyways, now that I know how absolutely repulsive family &amp; moms behavior is towards our animals, I decided to take things into my own hands in a couple of ways. One of them was to finally neuter and register our three year old cat, and take my dog to the vet to have him registered to my name. I went on r/AmITheAsshole to see if I would be wrong in doing this behind their backs, and reddit said I wouldn’t be, so I went through with it. It did not go smoothly at all.\\n\\nSparing the details, since it’s 12am and I’m tired as hell after today, my mom hit me, once, and tried to pull my cat off me because she saw me  going to put him into the car. The dog was already in the car at this point. She yelled at me and told my maid to take the cat away. My maid, being on my side but not wanting trouble from mom, took the cat (without the crate) and went inside. I followed, and my mom followed me. She was continually yelling at me while I was looking for my cat, and threatened to hit me for disobeying her. I looked at her and said I’ll call the police if she gets physical on me, because I will absolutely not accept physical abuse of any form from her. So that was when she said “Go ahead and call the police!” and did a small hit on my shoulder. I told her to quit being a child, and kept looking for the cat. My mom was trying to pull the crate from my hands, but I simply held her hand and pulled it away one by one each time. I ended up finding the cat and putting it in a box. Though, because of how she was tailing me, I couldn’t close the crate door and so I had to hold it vertically like a basket and not allowing the cat to jump out. Once I had the cat like this, my mom blocked the doorway outside. I put my back against her and slid past her, barely fitting and she didn’t out up much resistance. I began walking to the car, so then she called me mentally insane and didn’t follow me. I was able to leave.\\n\\nThe cat is gettung neutered now, still at the vet (decided to leave him there)and the dog was registered but not neutered since he’s too young (which I expected).  So that’s how it went. Came back home, mom wouldn’t look at me, as usual.\\n\\n\\nSo, during all that yelling while I was trying to find my cat,  she said a lot of things that were extremely worrying. How she’d do to my cat and dog like she did to my old Akita, how she’d resell the new puppy. For about two hours now, I’ve been looking for dog/cat collars online that have GPS tracking and won’t unlock unless accessed by me, so that I would have my pets locations at all times and my mom wouldn’t be able to remove them. If she sold them, locating them would be easy this way. I wanna know how I can do that, if any of you can tell me...and uhm, I guess this really is an abusive family. \\n\\n\\nHonestly, the story is pretty warped up there. A lot of details were spared because I am seriously not bothered to type them at the moment, I apologize. Though, it gets accross the main events and how my mom acted, which is all that really matters. I know that I didn’t ask for any specific advice, but honestly please fill me in with any info that might help me. Any sort of wisdom, or perhaps a method to not allow my mother to steal away my cat and new dog.

       "  \"So, this is going to be a long story, but there is a TL;DR at the end. Anyway, here goes I guess. So I've always been close with my mom. When I was 12, she moved in with her boyfriend who had four boys, and I already have a brother, so it was 6 boys, me and my mom. Naturally, I just got close to her because she was the only other female that I had in a chaotic situation. I told her literally everything. When I lost my virginity when I was 17, I told her (more on this later). Point is, we were really close through my preteen and teen years.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, I guess I should add that I've pretty much always had problems with mental health. I have PMDD, which is a pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder, which means that I basically have PMS on crack. Ever since I had a period, I've had wild mood swings. Every single period, every single month, I'd have suicidal thoughts and be stuck in bed all day. The reason why I mention this is that it took *over 5 years to get on birth control.* I suffered through this for over 5 years, by myself. You might be asking-- why is this relevant to your mom's boundary issue?  Well, she pretends like she is there for me, so it's like I owe her something. But she isn't. She let me suffer on my own and  left me to deal with my own emotions. I asked for years, she watched me suffer, but didn't help. A few years later, at 19, I ask about anti-depressants because I was just feeling anxious and numb. I got on Zoloft and am feeling like a normal human being for the first time since I was 10. She has never been any help through any of my mental health struggles. I asked to go to therapy, but this was all over-shadowed by health issues that my family had.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThr main health problem to add is that my brother (M16) was diagnosed with brain cancer at 14. Mom thinks that this is the trigger for all of mental health issues (hint, it isn't). Obviously, it adds to everything, but I have a different experience than they do. She doesn't care to learn about my experience. Every time I try to have a serious conversation with her, she is on her phone, scrolling through Facebook. It just feels that she doesn't care about me, my thoughts, or my emotions. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHence, why I chose to live with my dad. They live in the same neighborhood. Literally 5 minutes away from each other. Now she is bitter because I'm not living there (oh, it was half time before. One week at each house). I waited to move in with my Dad until I was 19 (after my first year of college) because I knew it would've been a shitshow in high school. My brother, of course, wants to do it too because he likes to spend time with his sister. She blames me for that, so I try to tell my brother that it is important to stay at Mom's because he is not 18 yet. She just makes me feel so guilty for making a decision that I have the authority to make. Oh, and she also gets mad when I say my college town is home. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI hate coming back home because she is just so suffocating. She demands to know things about my love life that I am not comfortable sharing with her. That's really my biggest problem. I went out on a casual date on Tuesday, and she is pestering me about another date. She asks if I've kissed/had sex/etc. with my dates. I told her that it wasn't her business and she got offended. She said that I was her business. I don't want to feel like the asshole, but I also know that I need my private space and my boundaries, and it feels like she is crossing them.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnother thing she does is demand that I help her with chores around the house. I will come to visit, often after work, and she will make me go do *her* laundry, even though she didn't work the whole day and was watching TV. I don't mind doing things for her, but at this point, I do so much for her that isn't being reciprocated emotionally or physically. Many kids come home from college and their mom does laundry and helps them with their stuff, but I end up doing everything for her, in addition to my chores and errands. I feed myself most of the time. I pay for (most) of my own stuff. I pay for ALL of my schooling. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, I don't really know what to do at this point. She has been pushing my boundaries and really frustrating me. If anyone has dealt with any of these boundary issues from parental figures after coming home from college, please let me know. Thank you. \\n\\nTL;DR: Mom is pushing my boundaries with my love life, my home life, and my emotions, and I need advice on how to get her to understand that I need private space and respect.\"),\n",

I’m only 24 and I don’t really have any experience dealing with banks and certainly don’t have experience dealing with something like this. \\n\\nTo begin, my grandmother, who is literally the sweetest most kind hearted woman in the world, appears to be in a serious situation right now. She has been talking to this person online for the last 6 months apparently. It started out on Facebook, a man who is going by the name “James Henninger” added her as a friend and  struck up a conversation with her. Before long it moves from Facebook to texting her phone and then to google hangouts (which I’ve heard is notorious for being used by scammers). \\n\\nShe has apparently been sending him money here and there, started out as just sending amazon gift cards to him at some address in New York. The guy told her that he is stationed in Syria and gave her a whole sob story about how his platoon was bombed and he lost all of his personal belongings and had no way to access his money. He asked her to open up a bank account with SunTrust and send him money through that. He also had a box of checks sent to her home. I don’t know every detail because she is obviously not being 100% transparent with us about it because she is embarrassed that she has fallen for this. I’m not sure if he has access to the account or what, but I’m assuming he does since he is getting the money somehow. Like I said she isn’t being completely honest with us about the whole thing so I can’t give as many details as I would like. \\n\\nAnyway, my mother got a call yesterday from a man who was trying to get in touch with my grandmother. He said he was with the corporate security department of Regions Bank (which is apparently the parent bank of SunTrust I think? I’m not completely sure) saying that he needed to speak to her about checks that had been deposited that were not hers. She called him back and he told her that one of their clients has had $57000 taken out of his account (which was the account that checks had been deposited into, as well as her main bank and he named both SunTrust and her main bank). So apparently this scammer has gotten ahold of this other mans account and is using it to funnel money through to himself. At least that’s what I’m getting from what he said, like I said I’m not 100% sure because I didn’t talk to the guy myself. \\n\\nLong story short my grandmother may be in some serious trouble. I don’t know if this guy has her social security number or not but I do know that she has given out a TON of personal information to him. He knows every member of our immediate family by name and what we do for a living. He knows her address and what her daily routine is. He obviously has access to her SunTrust account and is using her as a scapegoat to filter money from another mans account to his, if that makes any sense. \\n\\nOnce we found out about this, we told her not to let the guy know that we know it is a scam. But for some reason that I cannot understand, she immediately texted him and told him that we all knew about him and we knew he was trying to con her. She asked him if it was a scam (smh) and that he has still been talking to her, I’m sure just to try and find out what we know. \\n\\nI know this is probably hard to understand, I am very scatterbrained right now this whole thing has my head spinning and my heart racing because I am just so mad and so worried for her. She doesn’t have a lot of money and to think that some guy is trying to take advantage of her has me raging mad right now. \\n\\nPlease if there is anybody who sees this and knows what kind of action we can take, let me know. Obviously we are going to take her to close all of her bank accounts on July 5 when banks open back up. Is there anybody who knows how to find this guy or get his IP based off of his google account that he is using? \\n\\nAgain i apologize for this post being all over the place. My mind is a mess right now and I have major ADD so just typing all of this out in a way that is halfway coherent has been tough. If anybody out there can help or knows what we should do, please respond or feel free to DM me. Thanks in advance.'),\n",

She believed him. \\n\\nMarch 2012- my mental health has reached rock bottom and I spent two weeks in a mental hospital for attempted suicide and eating disorder (I was 100lbs and my dad called me fat, we didn’t have a good relationship) I didn’t tell anyone the real reason behind it all...\\n\\n2015- I became very suspicious again and gave into curiosity and started going through my dads phone and ipad. He had gotten a separate phone from his company supplied business one because he believed they were tracking him and listening in on his calls or some crap. My findings over the next two years- accounts for sites for essentially rich old men, Craigslist, back page, you name it. Nude pictures of woman. Conversations with woman thanking him for paying their mortgages and other things. Appointments at special ‘massage parlours’ (complete with a recording of his experience). Proof of a full on relationship with another woman who f*cking had cancer,and lived in the city where he constantly was for work, and proof that he had spent around $20,000 on her various expenses.  \\n\\n2017- My mother got suspicious again and I finally came clean to her. I showed her pictures I had taken of my findings on his devices. She was utterly devastated. I will never forget the look on her face that night.... when he came home that night she confronted him with all the evidence I had given her. He didn’t say anything, he just cried. \\n\\nAbout 10 days later he moved out of the house and into an apartment. \\n\\nNow here’s where the real f-d up crap starts to happen. \\n\\nMy mother kept in contact with him. He’d come to the house to come and walk the dog and they would talk. They agreed he would start seeing a councillor and then they would go to one together to see if they could work it out. My mother told me she would give it a year to see if it could be fixed or not. The one year was up June 2018, she decided that she needed another year. Since my fathers funds were no longer tied up in his extra curricular activities he finally put the money into renovating our kitchen and bathrooms (he’s always been the type to think that money can buy love, ha). He and my mom started going on ‘dates’ again and were starting to spend quite a bit of time together again and were going to couples counselling, as well as their own individual councillors.   \\n\\nNow I should note from the night I told my mom about what a monster he was I have refused to speak to him. He paid for my mom and I to go the Jamaica for her birthday and she forced me to write him a thank you card. I’ve also had to write a thank you card for him giving me $3000 at Christmas. My older brother has kept in contact with him, even though it’s strained he feels obligated to since dad has paid for his 10years of university and expenses. \\n\\nMy brother is going to France for three months as part of a university research exchange. My mom is going to go visit him and the original plan was for her to go with my brothers girlfriends mom. That’s changed. My mom is about to go (nothings been booked yet)  to France with her piece of Shit husband and I believe that means there going to get back together and he’ll move back into the house in June. \\n\\nI can’t even begin to describe how much this devastates me. My mom and I are super close and I honestly love her more than anything in the world. But I don’t love her enough to be able to support her decision to get back together with him. This man ruined my life. The mental f*cked up-ness he has caused me is out of this world, and my mom knows this. If they get back together my relationship with my mom will never be even close to the same again. For starters I can’t even begin to imagine the toll this is going to take on my mental health... and I will never go back to my mothers house, my home, ever again as long as that man is there. \\n\\nI have no idea why my mom has even gave him a second thought from day one, but I believe the thought of loneliness scares her... even though before she ever found out about his wrong doings their marriage really wasn’t the best. He always has, and even to this day, belittles her and talks down to her like she’s a stupid child. My mom has started to stand up for her self a bit in the past year but over all still doesn’t really have much of a back bone to him or the situation at all. \\n\\nI go back home in two weeks and it is pretty much my last shot to essentially make my mother choose between me and him.... \\n\\nSo internet strangers, what do you think I should do....\\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? \\n\\n(Sorry for such a long post) '),\n",

And I just want to apologize in advance if this is really long, and if I don't make much sense or misspell a lot in this post. it's late, and I've been up all night crying and worrying about my girlfriend. I really woud appreciate more than anything any advice on how me and my girlfriend can cope with the overwhelming anxiety and stress we're both going through right now. \\n\\nAs the title says, my girlfriend, as of last week was told she has a brain tumor by her eye doctor a few hours after her GP told her he suspects she has some type of cancer. So she has to wait to get tests done. She's been in and out of the doctors, eye doctors, and ER for a few years now with no answers to what has been causing a blind spot in her eye, and tons of other symptoms. Until finally, about a month ago, after a trip to the emergency room, the doctors there found out she had a scotoma in her left eye (after being told for over a year straight by her eye doctor that nothing was wrong with her eye) this led to her eye doctor finding out the cause of her scotoma was a brain tumor, and the same day before she found this out, her GP told her she meets all the criteria of colon or another type of cancer, and has her scheduled to get blood tests done this Monday to find out more.\\n\\n Now she has to wait for a letter telling her the date of her appointments to go get more CT scans and tests done on her head, and ultrasounds done on her stomach. These letters with appointments have always taken at least 2 or 3 months to arrive.\\n\\nSo it's all a huge waiting game to find out answers now. My anxiety and stress levels as well as my girlfriends have been driving me and her absolutely insane. We've both been stressing so much over all of this and I've been losing so much sleep. It's all almost unbearable. We've always found ways to relax and calm down in the past, but this is something new that we've never had to experience before in our lives, and I personally just don't know how to handle it, or what to say, or do, and I just feel absolutely hopeless and helpless.\\n\\nIf anyone has any advice for me, and or especially for my girlfriend on how to get through this it would be appreciated more than absolutely anything. Thank you so much.\\n\\nTLDR: my girlfriend and I have serious anxiety problems. We found out last week she probably has brain cancer, or another type of cancer, and we won't know answers for a few months.

       " '8r5gsp': ('An old friend is being weird about a new friendship I’ve formed, and has started acting out because of it. Advice??',\n",
       "  'So I have this friend, let’s call her Jane. We started working together back in November. We became pretty decent friends, mainly because she had a falling out with her entire friend group and afterwards gravitated to me after that happened. \\n\\nA little backstory with Jane - There have been three separate instances in which I had a pretty significant falling out with someone, and she remained friends with these people. Now, I’m definitely not going to tell her who she can and can’t be friends with, or force her to choose sides, but she would continuously talk about her relationships with these people to my face even after I asked her to stop because I had no desire to hear about it. In doing so, she essentially proved to me how high I rank on her totem pole of friends - that’s fine, but I made the conscious decision to keep Jane at arm’s length because I didn’t feel comfortable allowing her into my personal life knowing she remained friendly with people who were not friendly to me. \\n\\nAnyways, so back in April I left the place where we worked together (for unrelated reasons). However, one of my girlfriends that still worked there was there one night, so I stopped in to say hey. In doing so, I met Tiffany*. So Tiffany was hired after I left, but she and I really hit it off. The three of us ended up talking for over an hour (no customers in the store) and Tiffany and I exchanged phone numbers. Afterwards, Tiffany and I became practically inseparable. We have hung out every single day, I’ve become great friends with her girlfriend, they’ve both become great friends with my boyfriend, we have a really nice group dynamic and sincerely enjoy each other’s company. \\n\\nTiffany reached out to me shortly after us becoming friends to express some concerns about Jane. She said she was unsure if Jane wanted the two of us to be friends. She said Jane had started making comments at work, such as “well you just don’t know OP like I do” or “you and OP aren’t as close and i am with OP” and when tiffany mentioned something I had told her, Jane stated “i already know that, me and OP talk all day every day we’re BEST friends” - this was an awkward development because as I’ve said, I have been keeping Jane at arm’s length and we surely don’t talk all day every day. I hadn’t even seen her in weeks when this conversation took place. \\n\\nAfter Tiffany and I spoke about this, I did notice Jane was acting odd when I would mention Tiffany, and then Tiffany told me that Jane had stared speaking negatively about me at work (completely out of the blue). Saying how I shouldn’t be trusted and how she wonders if I’m “fake.” This was pretty hurtful because I’ve never gone out of my way to be rude to Jane, even after everything happened with the three previously mentioned individuals.  When Tiffany and I first talked about it, we even made an effort to include her in our activities and invite her to go with us, in which she either repeatedly declined or if she did join, would make bare minimum conversation and stay on her phone all night. \\n\\nTiffany has grown increasingly aggravated with Jane as well, because she’s constantly degrading me and Tiffany doesn’t like that Jane knows we are friends and still says the things she says. There have been two instances where Tiffany told her to stop, and yet it continues. \\n\\nNow I’m coming back to the job where Jane and Tiffany still work, and I don’t know how to handle the shift in friendships. I love Tiffany and I would not risk my friendship with her just to appease Jane, especially after Jane proved time and time again she wouldn’t do that for me. But I also don’t want to say anything to Jane about it and create more drama, even though with the way she’s been acting lately I feel like I have no choice. I’m about to be surrounded by both of them together much more frequently and I’m at my wit’s end. And advice??'),\n",

I did fail geometry in 10th grade because I got lazy, but I paid for the class in my senior year to retake it so that I would graduate with everyone else, which I think makes up for it in my opinion. I graduated when I was 17 and 1/2 years old and immediately started college. This is when my parents said they would start charging me rent and all the other things I listed above. For some reason they also think me paying it isnt enough so they also want me to work a full time job to save money on top of going full time to college. The first semester was hard but I pushed through and gave it my all and then this last semester which just passed drained me and I barely passed and am considering dropping out. I have told my parents how I feel but they said they don\\'t care because it should be easy. This doesn\\'t make sense to me because they didn\\'t get their degree till they were in their mid 30\\'s, and by my age they had kids of their own. Every time I bring it up they just brush it off, I honestly don\\'t want to quit college, but at the same time I would like some support from them. It may be childish of me but after the past two semesters I don\\'t think if I move out ill be able to handle working and college all alone in the world. I just want my parents to recognize and appreciate that I\\'m doing good compared to what they were at my age. I know there are a lot of people who are working a lot harder than me and not breaking down but this is how I honestly feel. I also hope this post doesn\\'t comes off as whiny because that isn\\'t the message I\\'m trying to give off. Me and my family are good friends at best (as in relationship wise) I feel like I\\'ve approached the conversation of trying to get them to cut me some slack in so many ways but nothing gets through to them. Any suggestions would help.'),\n",

I would have long ago if I didn’t care about him so much.\\n\\nBefore someone jumps in to comment that maybe he just enjoys them, I’m going to paint a picture of his current life for you:\\n\\nHe currently has no job. He is adamant that his goal in life is to become a popular twitch streamer and make a living from it. He even said something about staying on unemployment while pursuing twitch full time instead of getting a job (jokingly, but I think he was testing the waters with me). He plays video games for 9+ hours a day, every day. Even when he’s not streaming. He leaves bowls of food sitting on his desk, throws trash all over the floor and doesn’t really clean anything unless I tell him to before I come over. We can play video games for two hours straight and when I go over to his place he asks if I want to play games. Whenever he isn’t playing games he is constantly on his phone watching videos from YouTube “celebrities” who he idolizes because he thinks he can be them one day.\\n\\nDon’t get me wrong, I’ve been supportive. I’ve helped get his twitch channel to where it is now (500 followers after over a year of full time streaming, so not amazing. Concurrent viewership is like 2-4 people and has pretty much been at a standstill for a while now). But I’m honestly sick of him prioritizing fake, meaningless shit over his own health and life, and also me. \\n\\nIs there someway that I can convince him to take it down a notch?? I don’t want to break up with him because I do love him but I’m honestly ready to if he can’t grow up and realize he has no job, no car, no skills, and no other interests outside of games. I don’t see how anyone can spend ALL DAY playing a game when you’re almost 30 and can’t even pay for your own food most of the time! He makes a little money from twitch, maybe like $50 a month. Instead of saving up for a car so he can actually hold a job he spent it all on weapon skins for a game. \\n\\nWhat should I do reddit? \\n\\n'),\n",

I was the best at my job at my old location, but I transferred due to a move about 4 months ago. My new boss just did not like me from the very beginning. She would constantly make fun of my teeth to the other managers when she thought I couldn\\'t hear. I have white, clean teeth, but they\\'re a bit crowded and crooked in some places. She ended up demoting me from a hostess to a bus girl because I just don\\'t have \"the look\". I take very good care of myself, and I even do modeling on occasion. I\\'m not at all an ugly girl, but her comments and comparisons to my peers really wore down on me. I felt very singled out and let down by my company failing to protect me. I continued to stay at the job, because I didn\\'t have another one lined up yet. I started to look, though.\\n\\nMy coworkers noticed that the boss did this to me, and some of them stuck up for me. A couple of them even wrote her a formal letter, stating \"SpageddyLee does her job very well, and we enjoy working alongside her as a hostess.\" Their hearts were in the right place, but I think it just made her more mad. She then told me that I would probably never move out of the bus boy position as long as I worked there. \\n\\nMy boyfriend is the most supportive man in the whole world. He noticed that the job began to affect me outside of work. I stopped being able to eat, which caused me to lose a lot of weight. I was already less than 120 lbs, so this was not at all a welcome change. I looked sick, I was angry and sad all the time, and I developed major body image issues. I started to cry HOURS before I was scheduled, and would cry for HOURS after getting home. My boss also fired the other busser, making it impossible for me to EVER call out a shift, due to not even having another person trained to do my job working there. (This is important). He ended up telling me, \"If this job ever makes you want to end your life, I want you to tell me, and then never talk to those people again.\"\\n\\nAlthough I continued to look for jobs, I wasn\\'t really getting any offers. I live in a really bad area for jobs, Whatever, I thought, I\\'ll just have to deal with living unhappily until I can get out. I stayed with my bully of a boss, who continued to add more and more work to my workload. One day, I showed up for a shift on a day we were really slow. Two of my managers were sitting up at the front desk. They looked me straight in the eyes and told me to go home, because we were slow. I had multiple witnesses to this. The next day, I come in and I have a Final Written Warning for a No call/no show, written up by the manager who TOLD ME TO LEAVE! I couldn\\'t contest it, it was my word against the manager\\'s word, who insisted I never showed up, even though she\\'s the one who told me to leave, and both hosts and one bartender saw this happen and stood up for me. I ended up having to take the final written.\\n\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen my boyfriend so angry. He\\'s a manager at a different-but-similar company, and he told me that he had never seen another manager do something so blatantly mean and two-faced. He urged me to quit. He told me it isn\\'t worth the pain it\\'s causing me, and that he worries all the time about my mental health. I have severe anxiety and depression. I knew he was right, but I still couldn\\'t leave.\\n\\nWe found out we were pregnant almost immediately after this. I was so excited. Life was looking up for me. The job still made me want to die, but I had that baby to look forward to, so I went to work every day and thought about that, instead of my evil bosses and unfair workload.\\n\\nLater on, present day, last week. I\\'m about 12 weeks along. I started to spot before my shift. Panicked, I called my boss and tried to call out. She knew I was pregnant, and possibly miscarrying, but wouldn\\'t let me take the day off anyway. I had only ever called off one other time working for this company, over a year prior. Reluctantly, I had to go in, anyway. I started to bleed very heavily about halfway through my shift. I mean, very very heavily. I\\'ve never seen anything like it. It was running off my legs, I\\'m SURE the guests could tell. I was very visibly upset, of course. I was losing a baby I wanted very much, and I was so embarrassed that my boss would NOT let me leave. We weren\\'t even very busy, she just wanted to be cruel. After trying to clean myself up in the bathroom for the 4th time in 45 minutes, I decided I wasn\\'t going to be treated like this any more. I called my boyfriend to come get me, and I went home. I blocked every number related to the job in my phone. I went home, and sobbed uncontrollably for days.\\n\\nComing out of this, I don\\'t know how to proceed. I\\'m incredibly depressed, both by losing my baby, and job-hunting, knowing my chances for any job now are bleak. I know it\\'s THE MOST irresponsible thing to do to quit like that, but I felt like I had no other option. They were abusing me. They did not care about me as a person, and I do not regret it. I\\'m only worried about what my boss is going to say to any new employers that contact her, because she isn\\'t afraid to give a nasty reference, for even pettier things. This was only my second job, so I can\\'t just not use it and have a 2 year gap on my record. What should I say at an interview about why I left my job? I know it isn\\'t right to ever bad-mouth a company, but they seriously treated me bad and that made my decision to leave. Should I tell the truth?'),\n",

I live and work in Sweden for the local authority/municipality as a cleaner in our hospital, there are several branches for the municipality but I’ve worked for the “cleaner” one for about three months now.\\n\\nThe other day I got a doctors appointment, at 1pm on a Friday which is scheduled as work time, I asked for time off five days in advance and one of my bosses said she’d had to discuss with the other bosses if it was okay. I later got an OK but was advised to keep appointments on my private time. Is this correct? Am I not allowed to see a doctor and ask for time off? \\n\\nAnother thing that has happened is about my 21 year old colleague, she got sexually harassed by another employee, male 23. And told our boss, who set up a meeting with him and her even though she specifically said she did not want to sit in the same room as him. They also allowed him to bring a friend as he felt he was faulty accused, what the hell? My colleague was extremely uncomfortable but went to the meeting where she was met with disbelief and a comment from our boss “maybe you didn’t tell him enough that you weren’t interested and maybe part of this is your fault too, maybe you’re too inviting”. The male quit shortly after this so it was never addressed again.\\n\\nEveryone that works here, except a few full time cleaners, is employed by the hour, this is good since I am a part-time student and we can chose our own schedules and work as much as we want. I help out as much as I can at work but they still shame you if you can’t work when they want you to, I’ve been asked to quit studying, to skip school a specific day because they need people and when I say no they get pissy. Our contract says we have to work at least two times during a span of two weeks, which I well enough am. I work four-five days a week and sometimes weekends.\\n\\nThis is just a few things that have happened during the short time I’ve worked here, but I feel like this isn’t right. Is there anything I can or should do about this? I’ve heard of people getting fired for speaking their minds as the higher ups seem to be friends with some of our bosses and managers. I’m told that’s why no one has done our said anything. Am I overreacting or is something not right here?\\n\\nTL;DR: I feel mistreated at work and don’t know what to do about it. '),\n",

       "  \"Some backstory first for further understanding of the situation:\\n\\nI'm a 20 year old male, my gf is soon to be 21. We found out about the pregnancy in May, and decided that we want to keep the baby. Both of us are extremely happy about that, and we are looking very forward to it. My mother's side of the family is very supportive, and very happy for us. So is my girlfriend's entire family, and it's been a huge help.\\n\\nI'll try my best to keep this short, but I kind of need to vent a little bit about it as well I guess.. So please bear with me.\\n\\nFirst off, I lived with my mother until I was 13, when I moved to my dad because I was a bit of a difficult teenager at the time. My mother though, has always been extremely loving, a great mother, and treated me like an individual. She always listened to my concerns, fears, opinions and I was always taken seriously no matter my age. I love her very much.\\n\\nI told my dad about the pregnancy last. This is because I know him as a person, and I knew for sure he was not gonna be happy about it. I also recently found out after speaking to my girlfriend and her family about my situation at home growing up with my dad and my stepmom, that I was abused.\\n\\nThis is something that has been eye opening for me, as I always thought the way I was treated was normal. But I've always been verbally abused, getting yelled at all the time for nothing, being treated like I'm just a child all the time, even as an adult now. Decisions were taken for me, I was told, whatever I did, that it wasn't good enough, that I wasn't good enough and can't support myself at all doing anything myself. My father physically hit me twice when I was younger, and I was led to believe it was normal, being guilt tripped about ruining the family when I eventually told my teacher about it and my dad found out. Nothing came of it.\\n\\nSo, in short, I've lived in fear of my dad for years.  Never daring to stand up to him out of fear of what might happen, and it ruined my own self esteem. I moved in with my girlfriend a year ago, and it's been fantastic for me mentally.\\n\\nSo yeah, let me get to the point. I told my dad about it, he got furious as expected, yelling, telling me I fucked myself over. But after lots of supporting words from her family and my mother and grandparents on that side, I was confident this was the last straw, as I'm not letting anyone try to tell us what to do, especially regarding our child.\\n\\nI remained calm the entire time I was speaking to him, telling him that I've been afraid of him for a long time, and that it's affected me a lot mentally how they treated me, verbally and physically. And he just called it bullshit. \\n\\nSo I told him if you're gonna be like this, block my fucking number cause I'm done being told what to do. He called me a coward, and that I have one day to apologise for everything I said. And like hell I'm doing that, I think he should be the one apologising. So I blocked him, my stepmother, and I have no plans on contacting them again.\\n\\nBut I have two little brothers, aged 11 and 8. The oldest brother is depressed and suicidal, and he's just 11. I know a lot of it is because of the situation at home. And I feel so damn guilty about leaving them. I want to contact them somehow. I have my brothers snapchat, but I know what I say is gonna reach my dad and stepmom anyways. I also have no clue how to explain any of this to them.\\n\\nI'm sorry for the long text. Any advice would be deeply appreciated as I'm concerned about them, and I don't want to lose them for good, even if I have no plans on contacting my dad there.

He doesn't really admit to it but we know that he's 100% on it. He regularly loses his job and disappears over weekends, making it difficult to contact him. When he eventually comes home he just crashes for hours (15 to 20+). My mum loves him dearly. He used to be a good kid but now hes just a complete and utter selfish piece of shit. \\n\\nMy Father has lung cancer and was undergoing radiation treatment, but caught a fever after 2 weeks of daily radiation. The other night, he woke up from a nap late in the afternoon and could barely breathe so we rushed him to the hospital. He almost died that night because my mother and I were visiting my sister who just gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. He's staying in the ward at the moment, and he finds it hard to do any activities even if they're just mundane tasks, or his breathing suffers. \\n\\nHis health doesn't look very good from and I need advice on what I should do to help my family should he pass away, particularly regarding my mother. My sister is amazing, and always ready to lend a hand when she can. She will probably take my mother in if my Father passes, leaving my brother on the street, which is probably for the best. I suggested kicking him out of the house multiple times but my parents could never kick him out of the house, as they are very loving parents. I think my father will make it through this sickness, but even so, he'll still be left looking after my useless brother (lost his license).\\n\\nI live by myself 4 hours away by plane and I'm using my leave to visit them for 2 weeks. I want to know what I can do to help. What can I do about my brother? He's been abusing for years and my parents have tried their hardest to get him off the drugs but they're so easy to come by in my town he just gets back on it every time. His selfishness has put my family through so much stress the last couple years and I cant help but think I could've done more to help.\\n\\nHow do I wake my brother up?\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated.

I'm not in a relationship right now, so idk if it was anything to do with it but I don't think so.\\n\\nAnyway, when I have this thought it always makes me cry or really depressed for that moment. What is it? Well, time. Once in a while I think about time and life, how I'm afraid of the time going on. My parent's are in their late 50's I have 3 siblings in over their 30's. And I'm afraid idk I just think to myself how 10 years from now things could change and by change I mean my parent's could be gone, my siblings will grow older, and that scares me. I don't want time to keep going anymore, I don't want to remember how life was today or before. Right now I'd wish I was still a kid I would go back to being a 9 year old brat where I would be with my family. And tbh I'm not really a crybaby I rarely cry or take anything bad seriously. Getting hurt, bulling or dumb stuff like that was never an issue. \\n \\nWhen I was 10, 9 years ago, my brother was killed, my mom was devastated, I was clueless at the time, but when I saw it with my own eyes I cried for the first time and never did again until recently. My brother was 20 when he died. I honestly wished he was alive instead of me. He was rebelish, a deliquent, and violent, but after he got out of juvie he began taking life seriously, he changed, he just needed a couple more years before he could come back home since he was deported for a couple of years. Back to the main thing.\\n\\nI miss him, I miss the time when I was young, when I didn't think about life seriously, honestly being who I am I see myself as a waste of air, my life has been the best, honestly if someone else lived in my shoes they would say wow your life is fucked up. But I don't mind, I got tired of thinking to myself why is life bad for me, why did I get nothing, but I didn't get nothing, how I saw life back then was that, some people should at least get a couple things right. Other people I know got, A caring family, good health, money, education, intelligence,. Etc. Then I saw me, I got a family, that's it. I thought to myself, howcome that's all I got. He got a caring family and they are rich cause there parents studied, or they complain about how they got a 96 instead of a 97 in an assignment.

I would leave the library at 11 PM with a shaky body and dreamy mind. I haven't had the chance to relax on the weekends at all. After finishing school work, there are essays to write. After essays, there are my job. After my job, I call my parents and gf (I'm international). Sometimes, I would like to share how I am but most of the time, I am the listener. I listened to their venting and stories. I just could not find the voice to share my emotions. I have really good friends in high school.

I don't feel the urge to reach out, to send them a msg or just a simple how are you. I feel similar to a burden if I start complaining. I have all these emotions bottled up in me and I don't know how I can let it out. Nothing. Nada. There are just little voices in my head screaming suicide but I have been fighting it for a while. But I don't know how long I can keep it up with this. My life is slipping away from me and I don't know what to do. For the first time in my life, I feel hopeless.

       "  'So, for the friends I have as a 17yo male in high school: I have very few really good friends, I’ve never really had a large pool of friends to begin with. But I have a really toxic friend and I don’t know what to do about it. Among many things, he acts as if he cannot possibly be worse than me at anything, always putting me down. The easiest example to use is that we were talking about how our Christmas break went, and I mentioned that my cousin, who I’m fairly close to, is getting married. He instantly snapped back with a tone that said “well, that’s nothing,” and boasted about how many of his siblings were also engaged. The worst it has been was after we got back our ACT scores, which is kind of a big deal, and I got a 33 (out of 36) and he shrugged it off by saying I was just good at test taking. This genuinely pissed me off. He constantly does things like this, he gets especially bad when we play video games, and I win multiple times in a row. You can almost see the salt on his face in those moments.  The reason we really became friends is just because of mutual interests, no sort of sentiment what so ever.\\n\\nThe reason this is hard for me is that I go to a boarding school, and I see him every day we are there. I will admit, he is fine most of the time, but the toxicity is hard to deal with and the constant contact I have with him is not helping the situation. \\n\\nNow the second query, I find it really hard to make friends. I think I’ve figured out why, but I have no way to fix it in sight. I see people as potential friends, but I never do anything to help the relationship because I don’t want to be annoying or weird to the point of ruining it before it started. I just don’t know how to deal with this double edged blade. \\n\\nAnd to tie the two together, I think the reason I’m good friends with the first guy is because he isn’t a valuable friend, so I don’t see a risk of losing him because there isn’t much to lose.\\n\\nP.S.: Sorry for bad format, I’m on mobile.

However, in the past couple of months, I've gotten **really** close with another girl (E). We have an amazing rapport and I've never enjoyed being around any one person more than her.

My major (pretty locked in at this point) generally requires grad school and I have poor chances of getting in to one.\\n\\n**Trading:** I have been very successful trading over the past 6 weeks (after about 6 months of on and off study) with about 18 profitable and 2 unprofitable trades ON PAPER, making about 7% return. This is spending only about 45-60 minutes a day on this. I really enjoy this and have been spending a fraction of the time on it that I would were I to have enough money to trade for real.\\n\\n**Other:** School is a huge financial burden (I am living off family member's money). Due to some mental health circumstances requiring me to take a leave from school early on, my GPA is shit and I won't get into the grad schools that I want. I may also be able to receive the money which otherwise would have gone to paying for my education to pursue trading, which would give me great starting capital.\\n\\nI have a few dreams, and right now the most relevant is financial independence. I'm tired of being a financial burden on my family, and after overcoming some mental health issues including a stay in a psych hospital, I have finally been in a position to pursue the thing that I wanted to go to school for: finance and trading. And to see myself be successful at it on paper, it's invigorating like almost nothing else.\\n\\n**My plan:** So yeah. I could drop out and bartend, work night jobs while trading during the day and make probably $40-50k this year, of which I might invest about $20,000 into trading. **Based on my major and GPA, this is probably about as much as I'd make after graduation anyway.** At my current rate of return it would take just over a year to double an investment, so if I can continue perfecting my trading strategies and investing money from work, it might take about 2.5 years to pocket $100k of profits.\\n\\nI've already paid for this next quarter of school, so I will continue to test my trading ability, and if it flops or becomes less consistent, well I'll have my answer.\\n\\nSO, r/advice, do I drop out of school to pursue this dream?

We ended up becoming partners and things were kinda rocky at the start. She ended up earning my trust and proved all the rumors were false. Over the the past couple of months, we became best friends. She really earned my trust after recognizing how I was truly depressed and pointed it out to me. \\n\\nWe ended up being split up (according to the big wigs, its temporary) because I reclassified and need to go through training. One night we were texting because we couldn’t sleep. We started to flirt pretty hard and tried to give it a shot. She then ended up pulling back and said she needed to work on herself. Okay I understand, that relationship fucked her up pretty bad. Then a few weeks later we started flirting again, just to get pulled back again. Same reason. A few nights later, things got pretty explicit and it kinda stopped after that.\\n\\nWe still continue to talk because we’re besties and we finally began to hang outside of work. She was finally dating people so I thought I had a chance, but she kinda just blew it off. She ended up meeting a dude that set off so many red flags to me. Like it’s not a jealously thing, they are legit red flags. Dude is a felon out on probation for drug charges. He took awhile to bring this info too light. RF#1. Now he said that was a rough time in his life and he has corrected his ways.

Especially since she accidentally made a few mistakes in logs. \\n\\nRF#2 is He has (or had. Its such a complicated situation that’s still developing) a fiancee that he never mentioned at all. He claims that he was gonna bring it up, but she found out when the fiancee called her asking who she was and all this. Then she heard him in the background with a yell and then the line went dead (RF#3).\\n\\nRF#4 is now she’s been sucked into this hard because she’s head over heels about him and has ignored my advice to avoid the whole situation.

Seeing her get hurt just fucking kills me in so bad.\\n\\nI was talking a mutual friend of ours about it all and the friend agrees that her and I would be a great couple and I just need to tell her how I feel. So I did. She said we have way too many differences (only thing I can really think of is religion and politics) and she’s just not comfortable with escalating our friendship into a relationship. That sucked, but I’m just rolling with it because I love having her as a friend.

I’ve struggled with severe depression, social isolation, loneliness, anxiety etc since basically middle school. \\n\\nHad a child at age 19 with a very abusive boyfriend, he left when I told him and I didn’t speak to anyone except my mom for 13 entire months (pregnancy and newborn stage). Lived at home with parents who are very mean. I was desperate for socialization and companionship, so got back together with child’s father. He was still abusive/Cheating and we ended our relationship after a suicide attempt by me, and him punching me in the face several times soon after. \\nHe disappeared from our lives. \\n\\nMet a great guy this year in February 2018. He’s Indian, so parents that probably would’ve never approved of me. We discussed this in the beginning and wavered on our decision to date. He finally came to me and said he’d choose us and live his own life etc. Since then my son and I have basically lived with him, he encouraged me to get an amazing job, I’m really doing well for myself, my mental health is the best it’s been in years. He helps with my son, babysits, takes him to school, daycare knows him as “Dad”. I signed up for 4 college classes while working 40 hours a week as an accountant because he offered to help as much as physically possible. He calls himself my sons dad. Fast but I can honestly say we are the same person, and made for each other. \\n\\nSo the suicide. Totally, and completely out of character for him. He’s very mature, educated, has a great career and life outgoing type of man. He drank too much on Labor Day, left a note in his apartment saying “I’m sorry for anyone this hurts. Love you all goodbye” beside his cell phone. I came to spend the night with him and that’s when I found the note and his phone, but not him. I immediately called his brother, whom I’ve never met. He, in turn, called their parents, who showed up at his apartment where I was alone with my son, crying my eyes out. \\n\\nThis was the worst possible way I could’ve met them, but they said they were thankful I called. They got boyfriend to return home and he said he’d explain later. He went to their house Tuesday night and they forbid him from being with me. They said they’d make sure themselves and the entire extended family cut him off and never acknowledged him. \\n\\nBoyfriend took all of this very seriously, despite it being a known scare tactic of Indian parents, and usually false. He is saying his “mind is made up” and he’s choosing them because it’s “everyone he knows” and he thinks he will be such a disappointment. \\n\\nBut.... now I’m lost. My son has lost TWO fathers this year and he’s not a tiny baby. We were planning to buy a home in January, we have an expensive vacation planned for November. We were gonna give my son a family Christmas. Now I’m just... stuck at home. Completely isolated with my very mean, abusive, aggressive borderline personality mother. My mother turns my son against me and tells him that she’s his “mom” and that I’m no fun. No plans, no friends, no boyfriend, no help with my child that hates me, nothing. Dating is the furthest thing from my mind, and with 4 classes, work, and a child I have ZERO time to hardly even make friends online, much less real ones. \\n\\nIs there any way to talk to him about his parents? Any Indian people to chime in to help? How do I get out of this unscathed if I have to lose him? I feel like I was allowed happiness once in my entire life and it crumbled out from under me overnight. '),\n",

She was a sophomore at the time, and we had a pretty difficult class together at the time. I think we hit it off strong, there was a Halloween dance that was cheaper if you went with someone, and she seemed pretty bummed out that no one had invited her, so I did being nice, at the time I didn\\'t really think much of her. During the dance, which was the kind of event where you went and just hung out with friends at a table while the DJ did his thing, E spent the first hour or so with her one friend she found, and then sat alone for about ten minutes before I found her. I can\\'t remember what I was doing, probably taking pictures with people, I went as Donald Trump and got into a mock fight with a Hillary. After that, I found E, took her by the hand and over to the table with all of my friends, and the rest of the night was pretty great. It\\'s important to note that E is pretty introverted, and someone who seems kind of unsure in how she\\'d like to express herself. One day she might dress and act goth, the next she\\'s in bright colors and extremely outgoing. So, I think when I took her hand, I might have made a mistake, or flustered her, or something. In the beginning she barely talked to me, and the rest of the night we were almost inseparable. Nothing of major note other than hand holding, but I was pretty happy, considering I\\'m kinda beta.\\nAfter the party, and I\\'d say into the months following into December, we were constantly texting, and talking in school when we could. Nothing super important; just small talk or about things she enjoyed or heard about, I was just happy I had someone to talk to. It was probably around this time I started to ask her if she wanted to hang out outside of school, in which she was normally busy, aside from studying in the public library. I can\\'t remember when this next part happened, but sometime between Christmas and February, E told me that if I was catching feelings, that she wasn\\'t interested, and just wanted to be friends. At this point, I was pretty much obsessed with her, but played it off as if I hung out or offered to with everyone I knew, like a typical beta cuck.\\nMonths past, and I think I didn\\'t do much to help my case in class. I\\'m somewhat conservative, and the class was all girls aside from myself. Needless to say, there were some conflicting opinions, and I stupidly would voice what I had to say whether it made people mad or not. I\\'ve always told people what I\\'ve thought if they ask, I hate being fake. it also happens that I really suck at arguments, since I don\\'t drop things until either they or I apologize or at least recognize the other persons standing and let them know about it. I probably pushed some things to far, and it seemed like E didn\\'t even want to be my friend anymore after a while. I graduated, summer pasted, and I\\'m now in my second semester of college. E recently got into a relationship, and then dipped out of it after who knows what, but considering I know both E and the ex, it was probably because they were too awkward to hold a conversation. I\\'ve held my feelings for E all this time, and I saw her today in the gas station while since I\\'m home on Easter break. I was thinking about the Lab report I have, and forgot to say hi.

I’ve been looking into other options that relate to my other interests, like esthetician school, but it feels shitty to think that I would have spent the last four years in school for nothing. I’m someone who needs structure and always wants to have everything planned out, so the not knowing is eating me up, and I’m starting to feel like I’m failing at being a productive adult. I have a lot of anxiety and have a fear of failure, and I find hard to motivate myself to even explore my options because it all becomes so overwhelming. I plan on talking to my professors and possibly the career coach on campus, so I’m hoping that can provide some guidance. In the meantime, I’d love some advice. '),\n",

       "  'Here’s the longer story (but the TL;DR is at the end): Ex (M22) and I (F21) were together for 1.5 years and engaged for 7 months, when he unexpectedly wanted to postpone the wedding. He had some good reasons (finances, job security, etc), but I think he ultimately just wanted out. Eventually through a month of counseling, we decided to end things and it was so painful, and definitely not what I wanted. It hurt like hell. But looking back, and after doing some self reflection, I realized we both had issues, and we very young and naive. I actually took a lot of the blame for things, realizing that I wasn’t perfect. \\n\\nFast forward a year and a half of awkward encounters and minimal contact, we actually ended up getting back together. It started out good especially because we both had grown from our immature past. But slowly I saw that I think he was honestly just lonely and horny, and wanted someone to be with. I really cared about him and wanted the best for him. He was going through a depressive state and some issues at work, and I was there whenever he needed to vent or talk about things. I didn’t mind being there for him, but the minute I wanted or needed him to be there for me he wasn’t. And he was just passive... wouldn’t start communication, wouldn’t initiative spending time together. I gave him grace because of his depression (knowing personally how hard that is) but it was hard to know whether or not he wanted to be together.\\n\\nEventually, he ended up breaking things off AGAIN. But here’s the reason why: he said it was because we didn’t share the same faith/religion (he was a Christian turning atheist, and I am Christian but NEVER pushed my beliefs on him), which I think was just a cop out. The more interesting thing is a week before he broke up with me, his brother broke up with his long time girlfriend.. reinforcing my belief that he was just lonely and horny, and wanted someone to be with. It was hard for me because I loved him... the initial love never went away. It’s hard to forgot someone you imagined spending forever with (and at one time planned to spend forever with). But I just felt used and played. \\n\\nTHIS IS WHERE I NEED THE ADVICE: \\nTwo months after our second breakup, he started dating this older girl who looks like me physically, apparently has a very similar personality (so my friends tell me), AND who is Christian. It really tore me apart, not so much that he was with someone else, but that someone I trusted so much could lie to me and use something so personal like my faith as a reason to break up. \\n\\nIn two weeks, there is a work reunion... and he’s bringing her. And I REALLY don’t want to meet her. I’m sure she’s a very nice girl, and I honestly would probably get along with her. But back when I first found out he was dating her, I went through a bad mental breakdown, full of comparison and depression. It was not good. I’ve grown so much in the last six months and I don’t want to go back to that place mentally, especially seeing him with her.\\n\\nAny advice? Anyone been through this before? I have to go because I’m coordinating the event (yeah, he sent his RSVP back to ME with his and her name on it.. talk about a coward). I honestly get a knot in my stomach thinking about seeing them together. It just hurts, you know? Any advice is welcomed. \\n\\nTL;DR: my ex and I have a very complicated history full of betrayal and a lot of emotion (broken engagement, got back together, lied, etc). He’s bringing his new girlfriend to a work reunion, and I just really don’t want to go but I have to. Any advice?'),\n",

His family is still very JW. \\n\\nFrom the beginning both side have been very open and honest. We are going to have a catholic ceremony at my church and his family was not going attend that part and just attend the reception. Yes, they were going to miss there son getting actually married but at least it was a compromise. I had set up a special time right after the ceremony to go take picture with them not at the church, I bought the mother a corsage, my fiancé and his mother had picked a tentative mother and son dance, I have set up the head table for his parents and my parents to sit with us.  \\n\\nThis whole time since December 2018 his family has been calling me and texting me asking me about the wedding and how everything was going, and I have been trying to keep them involved in everything as much as I can since they live about 4 hours away from us.

My first reaction is I want to speak up, I want to not be disrespectful but stick up for myself and at least tell the mom something like “ this is the first of many events that we are going to both need to compromise because of religion, I want you to please reconsider not coming, the hurt it would bring me if you didn’t come that scar would not heal for a long time and it will do great damage to our relationship” \\n\\nBut now laying here in bed I am thinking do I even want them at the wedding, if they don’t even wanna be there do I want to beg them to be, do I wanna be vindictive and use this as an excuse to not have to compromise in the future, do I want this looming are they and aren’t they coming cloud now over my wedding?

Any attempt at communicating and encouraging to find a better job ends up in him shutting me down completely.\\n\\n\\nThe biggest issue right now is this stupid job.  Greg has two great degrees, graduated with high marks and was overall successful in his college run.  Problem is, he is a lazy m$#@f*cker.  Growing up his Dad did everything for him, clean, cook, do his homework...including writing Greg\\'s resume and finding him jobs when he lived at home (1 hour away from where we live together now).  Speed up to almost 2 years ago when Greg graduated, he didn\\'t start looking for employment until he began running out of money.  At that point he was desperate yet... never left the house to give out a resume?? I was supportive and tried to help by driving him if he wanted yet he never took up the offer.  To sum up, he wound up finding a minimum wage retail job.  The past year he has put his all into it and just 3 months ago was promoted to supervisor.  The first 6 months he liked his job, as all new retailers do and then quickly found out some of the terrors that can lurk in the long run at a poorly run store (aka customers and shitty coworkers).\\n\\n\\nProblem is now, he hates supervising.  For all too understanding reasons, the people he works with are not the brightest, he finds himself overworked, cannot find time to do his hobby (gym) and gets frustrated with his friends (and me) when we plan things on the weekend when he is scheduled to work and can\\'t join. On top of this, management STILL hasn\\'t changed his pay to a supervisory roll (apparently he\\'s getting it this week three months late).\\n\\n\\nWhat I need advice on is kind of in the aftermath but is still important.  Today I had enough.  I picked up Greg from work and not surprisingly, for the nth time in the past year he starts complaining about how terrible his day was.  I am in exams and it is taking a toll on me.  I can\\'t stand listen to him suffering, it hurts me to know he\\'s in a bad situation but angers me BECAUSE HE DOESN\\'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  He makes up excuses that he uses his days off to relax and doesn\\'t want to spend them looking for other jobs yet is miserable.\\n\\nI love him and want the best for him but I can\\'t stand him complaining to me like this anymore when he won\\'t do anything about it.  I told him this and he told me in a sarcastic tone \"Well it sucks that yooooou are suffering from my suffering. Poor you for having to hear about my day.\" Obviously that didn\\'t go over well.  I told him, yes I was suffering as a consequence of his shitty job and that he needed to quit it and find something better.  We drove in silence the rest of the night home.\\n\\nAnyways, I am in the middle of exams and was too frustrated to deal with that, so I dropped him off at home and went back to the library.  Any advice would be great on how to approach this aftermath when I get home would be great.\\n\\nTLDR: Super educated boyfriend works in a shitty retail job and complains about it all the time yet is too lazy to apply for anything legitimate.

After a few days I was assured by my client that the PI was consistently on location because he's been sending photos of the twins on a regular basis. *In hindsight that's pretty odd as the twins have done nothing worth noting or capturing since I arrived, so to keep sending pictures would be a pointless waste of everyone's time.*\\n\\nAlso, it's worth noting that my client never wanted to meet in person.\\n\\nAfter a week and a half, I asked my client to send me some photos the PI had sent him so that I could get to grips with his location, it was a bit embarrassing and a blow to the ego but my only option left to find this PI.\\n\\n**Where was his location?**\\n\\n**My car**\\n\\n**The PI had taken photos of the twins from inside my car, sitting in the drivers seat.** This guy's f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*ing with me, He knew I was there the first day I arrived, I know that because the progress of the building work in the background matches my first day there. I always leave my car for a portion of the day in this type of work (food, coffee, shit etc) not to mention the police tend to get called about “a suspicious man in a car” and blow things out the water, so to speak. He must have entered at those times, but this isn't even the worst part.\\n\\nRoll back two days before hand: One night, sick of sleeping in a car seat after realising I was getting nowhere, I stayed in a grotty old dump of a hotel that had reasonable view of the twins so I could safely presume the PI would be close by and I wouldn't miss anything. I only stayed one night, it was worse than sleeping in my car.\\n\\nAll the photos my client sent me were taken from my car. All except **the one from the window of my hotel room... With me in shot... While I'm shutting the door leaving.

I haven't slept all night so my judgement is even more clouded right now, either this is genuinely from the twins, or I'm being played further.\\n\\nEither way I'm cornered and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to continue as if nothing happened except I can't bring myself to leave the car. I need to make a decision soon.

I definitely had a crush on him, but our friendship was completely platonic. I really enjoyed talking with him. We had a ton of things in common (sense of humor, music, etc) and he really opened up and discussed a lot of personal things with me. We live somewhat in the same area (30-40 minutes away), so we decided to hang out one night at a party we were both going to. I was expecting to just hang out with him in a completely casual way, but he started making moves on me and we ended up making out. \\n\\nNow I\\'m mature  enough to know that a kiss doesn\\'t actually mean anything, but it still really got my hopes up with this guy. After that night, we continued to message regularly and he would occasionally send me flirty messages and say he wants to hang out again. This got me even more excited about this guy, even though we were still just friends. \\n\\nSlowly our conversations got shorter and shorter and now we rarely talk, if at all. It\\'s pretty clear now that he\\'s not interested in me at all, and probably never was. He\\'s pursuing other relationships, which is absolutely fine since he never had any obligation to me. It just sucks because I genuinely really liked him. \\n\\nI\\'m just very confused. I really don\\'t have a lot of experience with boys (he was my first kiss), so I\\'m finding it hard to understand why he would kiss me and act somewhat interested in me if he wasn\\'t. I\\'m really embarrassed now about how excited and happy I was over kissing him. I feel so used. He probably just wanted someone to make out with and he saw me as an easy target. \\n\\nNow it sucks because I can\\'t stop thinking about him. It\\'s so hard to let go of the idea of him that I imagined in my head. I keep thinking that maybe if I was prettier, skinnier, etc, that he might of actually liked me.

She is 15 years old (not a whole year less than me, just 8 months of difference), blonde with blue eyes, very european looking although mexican too, 5\\'1 and lesbian (or bi, I dont really remember, I only know she really like\\'s girls). \\n\\nThis all occurred this weekend at a camping trip with my training team. It wasnt a training camp trip though, we actually played some drinking games and partied last night, but this happened the first night.\\n\\nYou see, the first day we made some challenges to decide who was going to sleep with whom on what part of the camp. There was three teams and three spots far away from each other but to make the story short my team won (partially because of me) and we got the best spot. We had 2 tents, one for 2 people and the other one for 5. We where 5 on the team, 6 with the leader, so the leader slept on the small one and we on the big one.\\n\\nHere\\'s the thing, we where 2 guys and 3 girls, so it was mixed. We also didn\\'t went to sleep at the same time so we didn\\'t chose our places. This because me and the girl went to sleep together before anyone else.\\n\\nWith \"went to sleep together\" I dont mean we casually went to sleep at the same time, and with \"the girl\" I dont mean she was some random girl, she is a friend and she\\'s actually the only one I knew before getting on the training team since we go to the same school. We agreed to go to sleep because it was kinda late already (12:15am) and we where both sleepy. \\n\\nAt first we layed down a bit separated from each other and started talking about each other. We spent like an hour just laying down and talking until we finally decided to sleep. Of course since 3 other people where going to sleep on the same tent we couldn\\'t stay on our initial places, so they pushed us all the way to the right and we ended up all cramped. \\n\\nI only noticed this like an hour after when I woke up trying to accommodate myself since I was very uncomfortable and got even more trying to give space to my friend. The whole night was shitty. From a healthy sleeping standpoint. Out of the 7 hours I was on the tent I only could sleep 4. Let alone the others that slept 2 hours. \\n\\nBut this isnt the main point of the story, I aint writing an entire reddit post just because I slept 20 fucking cm of a \"female\". Im not that pathetic. \\nThe shit starts at the morning, when the other guys started leaving and we where left more space. \\n\\nIt was around 6-7am when everyone started waking up and leaving that we started getting closer together. We where both awake for sure because of the kind of moves we where pulling. First she put her head on my arm, then on my shoulder, then I on hers, etz. Long story short, we ended up cuddled on the same pillow with she hugging me in a big spoon-small spoon manner, except I was facing upwards. She was so close I could hear her breath almost in my ear. The other guys even joked around saying that we where pretty much about to kiss each other. \\n\\nThis was very warm and cute and overall felt pretty good since I have been very lonely for big part of my life. I have never had a girlfriend and I blame myself for being such a fucking retard in middle school and not socializing. I swear to god I was on the path of becoming a pathetic incel if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I always despised and looked down on them losers, even when I was a fucking loser that wasted so much opportunities to get actual friends and a gf. But Im not anymore, Ive changed. \\n\\nStill, I dont really know how to swallow this. As I said already, I barely have experience on close friendships and even less in romance. Although I want to really remark this. Even though she is extremely pretty, I swear to god she is one of the most beautiful people Ive seen in my life, I dont feel sexual attraction. I really like her, she has a gorgeous face, good body and attitude. But I dont desire her in a sexual manner. Maybe it is the fact that Im almost an entire foot taller than her, or that she hasnt got that much chest. She\\'s just not like the other girls I fantasize with. She is beautiful, not hot. \\n\\nI want her as a friend, a close friend. Someone that can rely on me and I on. But I dont really know much about all that friendship stuff. So I would really accept some advice on whats our current friendship status and how to get us closer together. Anyway, thanks for anything.'),\n",

I definitely hope not. i\\'m definitely embarrassed even posting things but this community has helped me in the past. First, a quick intro. I am a 25 year old white male from the midwest- born here and lived in the same State my entire life (though we moved around a few times).\\n\\nA few weeks ago, someone brought something to my attention that has been weighing on my mind a lot and I feel conflicted, confused, and even a bit angry. I basically just want some answers, and that\\'s why I\\'m here. We were at a sports bar watching the game. My best friend invited me to join a group of people who knew each other well, so naturally people took an interest in me as the \"new guy\". Everyone was chill, and they seemed to take an interest in me, asking about my favorite music, hobbies, interests.... \\n\\nAfter talking about myself to the general group during the beginning of the night, the conversation split into multiple little conversations around the table and I was mainly talking mainly to the dude sitting next to me.   It was very noisy anyway and hard to keep up with everything going on around me.\\n\\nWhen I told my new conversation partner how good the Black Panthers movie was,  he burst out laughing and told me that I seem \"completely fascinated by black culture\" and asked me why I don\\'t \"have any interest in things white people do.\" I was nervous at the time and didn\\'t really internalize this comment. I was shocked but just brushed it off with an awkward laugh and we moved on. \\n\\nOver the next few days what he said really started bothering me. Dont get me wrong, I understand in a way where he is coming from. My favorite musicians are Drake, Nelly, Jayz, Kanye, etc. Its not because of race, I just like chill music. I used to be a diehard Kevin Hart fan and went to his shows a couple times. I\\'m into playing ball and play a couple times a week. I had a Kevin Garnett poster in my dorm room in my freshman year. I\\'ve always taken an interest in social justice causes and went to a few campus protests before, but standing up to police brutality isn\\'t about race to me. Its about equality.  And yes, I was a huge Obama fan and even helped volunteer part-time for his re-election campaign in 2012. I grew up in a liberal family and his message of tolerance, respect, and unity moved a lot of people. I think he was one of the most inspirational political figures in years and that\\'s why I got involved in his campaign. It was never about black or white for me. \\n\\nSo on one hand, i\\'m resentful that he called me out for my preferences in movies, sports, comedy, music. Its not racial to me, and i like what i like. I think it wasn\\'t his business and he was really out of line in saying that. \\n\\nBut on the other hand, i have to be honest with you guys. I gave it a lot of thought after the guy said what he said and realize that struggle to find a single white entertainer, athlete, or public figure that I respect. And in a way, I have to accept that it is a little unusual. But maybe at the end of the day it doesn\\'t even matter, right?

       " 'd0b6qb': ('Was my youth group leader a predator?',\n",
       "  'Not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask but, I\\'m really curious for other peoples opinion. Also, I am a female. \\n\\nWhen I was a freshman in high school, my friend at the time invited me to a youth group she had recently joined. I then started attending around September. There were around 4-5 youth group leaders and the youth pastor, during the first few weeks of meeting them nothing seemed out of the ordinary. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until almost a month later when I noticed I was being treated differently from one of the male leaders, who I will call Bryan. I don\\'t know Bryan\\'s exact age but I know for sure he is in his late 40\\'s, maybe 50 now and he is married with a kid. (I\\'ve only met his wife a handful of times)\\n\\n It was during a Halloween event Bryan was in charge of, when I noticed he clung to me. Throughout the event he stood constantly beside me and only talked to me. There was a haunted house at the event my friend and I were in line for when Bryan came up to go in with us. Right before entering I was holding on to my friends arm, then Bryan asked if I could hold on to his arm, which I did. During that night we exchanged phone numbers, when I got home he texted me how happy it made him that I was there, next to that many emoji\\'s including hearts. I was 14 at the time this happen. This might not seem like a big deal and it might not be, but I remember feeling uncomfortable and even guilty that I was the only we he payed attention to that night.  \\n\\nThen during a Thanksgiving event that couldn\\'t make it to, he texted me to take pictures of his son there. I did but instead of saying thank you, he began texting me like a peer would. I believe he used his son as an excuse to talk to text me. I left the youth group for the rest of the year since I felt so uncomfortable being around him \\n\\nThen during my sophomore year of high school when I just turned 15 I started going again. It was like nothing changed. Bryan was always next to me talking to me and gave bear hugs every time he saw me and when I left. I must add, he never hugged anyone else at youth group besides me. I always got text\\'s from him asking if I would be at youth group. I remember a specific text from him saying \"Hey girl, will I be seeing you tonight\". I feel like him texting me was questionable, but the way he texted me was even more questionable. Bryan also announced the announcements in front of everyone before the sermon would start. While he was up there he always stared as if he was only talking to me. My friends caught on to this and began teasing me calling him my \"creeper\". With my friends catching on I began to see this as a game. \\n\\nThis went on until my Junior year of high school. Bryan constantly called me cute and invited me out to non-youth group related events (which I never went). I felt like his pet at youth group. He always took selfies with me and complemented me, again he never did that to anyone else but me. I was the first one he told when he said he was leaving youth group and would no longer be a leader. During that time he texted me things like how much he would miss me and how he loves me. \\n\\nThe last time I\\'ve seen Bryan I was 17, and a senior in High school. I only went to youth group for a short amount of my senior year and stopped going after October. During a high school football game I ran into Bryan, I hadn\\'t seen him since he left youth group. He gave me 2 hugs during the first three minutes of interacting with him. He asked if i wanted to go to the snack bar with him, I agreed to go. The whole time he complemented me on how good I looked. He then offered to buy me food, I asked for a Coke. When I thanked him he said \"your welcome, I want to buy you more things\" then hugged me. When I got home he texted me saying how great it was to see me and how he would like to continue seeing me with many heart emoji\\'s. I\\'ve seen him once after that at yet another Halloween event (which he wasn\\'t with youth group). He texted me to hangout with him at that Halloween church event and I did. It was very awkward and I knew something wasn\\'t right. Again he complemented and took selfies with me. Bryan talked to me as if there wasn\\'t an big age gap between us. After I left he as always texted me how nice it was to see me. I felt guilty and disturbed after. \\n\\nBryan still has my number but now chooses to message me through Snap chat. To this day he still texts me randomly and even comments on my selfies. Although, I haven\\'t had a conversation with him since the last time I\\'ve seen him. \\n\\nNow during the four years I interacted with him Bryan NEVER touched me. Bryan NEVER asked for anything sexual from me. Was Bryan just friendly or was he too friendly? I\\'m not sure if I\\'m just over thinking this. I knew something was off with Bryan but I allowed him to get close to me. I think maybe out of lack of attention I lead him on. I would brag to my friends how Bryan would text me and how he was nice to me. I feel embarrassed by this now and guilty how I went about this. My two friends knew everything that happen but we just joked around about it.  I am now 18 and think about this a lot. I never told anyone about this so I\\'m not sure about other peoples thoughts on this.  I\\'ve missed so many other details but this post is long enough. Am I over thinking this?'),\n",

I'm 5 foot tall and I went from 105 to 120lb, I gained 15 lb my freshman year (classic i know ) and now I'm a junior and still haven't been able to lose the weight. I was really skinny my whole life and able to eat a diet consisting mainly of chocolate, cereals and pizza and never gained a pound. Today those unhealthy eating habits have finally caught up with me at 20 years old. I now have really high cholesterol, and I barely get my period anymore due to my unhealthy lifestyle (I have PCOS). I know and have been told by my doctors numerous times that it would help me get my period back tremendously if I just ate healthier and worked out. I'm definitely not overweight but I feel as though my body is used to being skinnier than I am now. Everywhere I go I feel like people are judging how fat I am, or I feel like my friends are probably judging me for how much weight I've gained. I went from being someone who didn't even think about food at all other than when she was hungry to someone who obsessively thinks about food at all hours of the day and as a result I just eat much more. I try all these fad diets but give up after a few days because they're too hard and then just end up stuffing my face with food. Even when I try just counting calories I give up within 3 or 4 days and I really just don't know why. Since I'm really short and fairly small all the calorie calculators online tell me to eat less than 1000 calories a day if I would want to lose 2 lb a week. I just feel disgusting and self conscious and I just wish I could be skinny again just so I could feel normal again. I feel like I'm stuck in this body right now that I don't even recognize, like this body isn't me. I'm generally a pretty confident person but when it comes to my weight I'm just totally ashamed. I know I'm not that heavy, so please don't reply that I should be okay with my weight because I'm just not. I want to go back to being how I was and I just can't stop eating shit. So I just really wanted to know if theres anyone out there that was in a similar situation and has brought themselves to lose weight and how?

Her mouth was sealed shut but you could see her make the most miniscule efforts to try and eat. I wrapped a towel around her. I tried wetting her face. I held her near the heater to try and keep her warm. I even attempted CPR after she was dead, when I didn't accept it.

Without any further ado, let's get on with this.\\n\\nWhen I was a young boy, I was happy-go-lucky like most kids. My Dad's family made me really religious back then, and I hadn't a care in the world. Ever since I was little I always questioned the existence of humans, but it all didn't matter, I thought God made humans or something. When I got older I began to realize how much I didn't fit in with the other kids, I never understood why, but when I was around age 12 I found out the whole time I had ADHD (predominant inattentive). The older I got the more I contemplated, and eventually when I was around 13, I decided I was an Atheist, I found the possibility of a God creating all of existence was not possible (that's just me personally). Lately I realized that everything we do is ultimately pointless, we suffer, we rejoice, we die. The solar system, galaxy, and even the universe shall come to an end too. I have no friends, am recovering from social anxiety, I don't fit in, and I can't feel happiness anymore. I'd say no one outside my family gives a damn about me, but even some of my family members just decided they don't like me. I'm lazy, useless, and good for nothing. I don't work hard, and sure you could say I could contribute to science when I get older, but I can't even focus in school without the damn medication, the very thing that gives me extreme mood swings and amped up my anxiety. The only reason I live is because my mom wouldn't know what to do if I died. But to be honest, if all she had to worry about was my sister, her life would be a lot easier. I see the beautiful things in life, and I struggle to see the day that might flip my whole life around. But I am lonely, no one spends time with me. I want to be with people, but I can't even fit in.

This year the dates are clashing with the wedding. \\n\\nI know the obvious answer is to refuse and to attend the wedding but one of my concerns is that I am the only person from my department to be nominated so it's kind of a big deal that they even considered sending me (the owner of the company is super stingy so just the fact that he approved my name on the list is huge) which is why it's going to make me look ungrateful and maybe a little arrogant and/or disrespectful if I say no (and that too for a friend's wedding which doesn't seem like a solid excuse in the corporate world to forgo this opportunity).

So far since I started in late October 2018 I’ve gotten a total of 3 breaks, adding up to about 20 days home in total. I make pretty good money, to the point where I can kinda buy most of the things I really want and have the capacity to save up for the things I can’t buy. Even more, if I stay for a few years I have the opportunity to eventually be promoted to a superintendent, who makes $630 a day (including per diem.) that’s obviously pretty great pay, the job is VERY easy, I’m pretty good at it, I generally don’t mind a lot of the people there, and I get to work with my dad which is nice.\\n\\nI hate it though. I can’t stand being away from home for so long, I have no hobbies that can transfer over to other states as my main hobby is making music, and I can’t bring most of the things I have in my “studio” with me. I’ve never felt such a longing for just being able to come home at night and actually do something I enjoy. When I’m working we get up early, come home late, and go straight to bed, which IMO is actually the easiest way for me to cope with it since I don’t have to sit and think about how much of my life I’m already wasting away.

We’ve been through quite a few struggles in the past and felt like having our very own space (whilst still having enough space in between our living areas to be separate from each other) would be the ideal living situation for all of us. My plan was to:\\n\\n1.) Get my car paid off\\n\\n2.) Get the house paid off (it’s actually a 2-story pole building with an apartment on top and a studio on the bottom)\\n\\n3.)Get X amount of dollars in savings\\n\\n4.) Gather up all of the expensive music gear that I’ll probably ever need (I have a list, and that list comes to like $40,000 for now, but obviously it’s gonna be a “get something here-and-there thing throughout the time I’m employed here.)\\n\\nThat’ll probably take me like 3 or 4 years. After that the only bills I’d have would be my half of the property payment (unless I decide to pay my half off too) and my utilities/insurance/phone bill. After that, I guess I’d quit and find a normal job that pays less but lets me have time at home to life a normal life. I just feel like people look at me funny when I talk about leaving this place. They always say “you’re young and you’re not tied down and you can travel and stuff” and I understand where they’re coming from, but I want to live an actual life, not dedicate 20 years entirely to this thankless company.

I just find her annoying and I don’t think it’s bad, I just don’t think we’re compatible. \\n\\nWhen we first met and started dating everything was great. Our personalities seem to work well with each other. We got along instantly after meeting. We were interested in similar things. \\n\\nBut I feel like I should’ve tried being friends for a bit longer before we started dating. I think we’re just very different people who spend time with very different crowds. She’s a very “tumblr-y” person in her attitudes and interests and the way she speaks and how her sense of humour works and such. And none of those things are wrong, it’s just things that after a while gets on my nerves. Most of my friends are sarcastic, chill. I’m friends with a bunch of athletes and more extroverted party-going people. She’s friends with more internet-dwelling introverted people, theatre kids, kids with multi color hairs. sorry if I’m dwelling to much on stereotypes, but at least in our circles the stereotypes are very true. A lot of her friends do really fit the mold. And both her and I have tried to introduce each other to our own friends and while I’ve been able to get along with them perfectly fine and even consider some of them friends of my own, she just doesn’t get how to socialize with extroverted, very outgoing people. \\n\\nAnd again, there’s nothing wrong with any of that. Whatever interests and personality makes you happy, fucking go ahead for it. I have friends that are exactly like what I described, it’s just that I don’t mesh as closely with them as I mesh with others. \\n\\nAnd my girlfriend has become more and more like that. A year ago I started finding out that I might be bisexual. I told her and she was super supportive. A few months ago she told me that perhaps she was feeling the same way. I reacted just as supportive and we both know that we won’t cheat or feel frustrated by being in a hetero relationship while being bi. We communicate a lot about these things.\\n\\nBut anyways, she started dwelling more and more into LGBT tumblr pages and memes and stuff and frankly, the general attitude of the tumblr crowds and memes are very supportive and bubbly or super self deprecating. And she’s becoming more and more like that. It’s hard to describe what that general sassy queer tumblr attitude is like but if you’ve ever been on twitter or tumblr you know what I mean. \\n\\n\\nIn any case, if that’s your personality then That is fine! It’s just that it’s not my crowd and vibe and the more time goes on the more I think that maybe we would both be better off with partners that we were more compatible with. \\n\\nLike texting is a big thing for me. With my friends, male or female, I joke a lot. We all joke back and forth and we build jokes on top of jokes and keep going and and are sarcastic and have this general attitude that she doesn’t have. She will unknowingly often cut conversations by replying with simple one word replies because she doesn’t joke back a lot with her friends in the same way I do with my friends. Or her sense of humor is very “tumblr” or very “haha I’m Gen Z YEET” and it’s very unlike mine. \\n\\nI want to date my best friend and I just don’t think my girl and I are that anymore. And she’s seemingly really in love with me but I keep finding her personality more and more annoying. Ugh \\n\\n\\nAnyways, that’s my situation. I can elaborate more but that’s the gist of it'),\n",

Yesterday there was some family drama between my parents and my older brother,  and I was in the middle of it.  Just to keep a long story short, my brother threw a tantrum at all of us. To provide a little background he is 24 years old and I am 20. He does have a history of having ADHD, depression, anger, and possibly bipolar based of how he was acting last night. He also does have a drinking problem, as he does have a DUI on his record. So after he throws his tantrum - which was very intense, my parents and I all collectively agree that he needs to be kicked out of the house. As he is packing his stuff, he comes back at me trying to fight me and pushes me. I get up and tell him, \"I wish you the best\". I wanted him to leave the house there, but he refused to leave and would keep coming back at me. Eventually I decide to call the cops. I\\'m going to paraphrase here, but basically cops show up, talk to him in the garage, talk to me and my parents in our house. The cops really can\\'t do much, but they suggest to him that he leaves for the night, which we all wanted him to do that. But before he leaves, our parents want him to take a breathalyzer and so the cops ask him if he will take one. He refuses and leaves.\\n\\n\\\\&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAt exactly 2:30 in the morning I get this [text](https://imgur.com/a/4Vk17Wt) from him. About an hour later I hear someone walk through the back patio door from the basement and towards my room. Luckily my room is locked, but a loud FBI breach kind of knock is pounded upon my door. I immediately call 911. I try to grab some sort of thing that I could use to defend myself just in case he happens to enter. I make sure I place camera facing the door to capture anything that could happen. He is yelling at me through the door for about 5 minutes calling me a bitch, saying he is going to sue me for false accusations, and destroy my car. He keeps urging me to open the door, but I refuse. I would later find out through the cops that he had a BAC of about .214 and possibly on some hard drugs, like amphetamines. Once the cops show up they start off talking lightly, but he keeps pushing it, by getting into my Dad\\'s face. He is handcuffed and taken into a police vehicle, where he is given his BAC, that he tries not to take. There isn\\'t really anything he can be arrested for, so the cops make him call an Uber and leave our house. The cops(who were great and very professional) give us a pamphlet on a restraining order. My brother doesn\\'t take so kindly to that. All while everything was happening, he is specifically targeting me, threatening me saying that he is going to show up at my place of work and to not go out tomorrow. After his Uber takes him away, he sends this [text](https://i.imgur.com/wwezbSo.jpg) to my mom,dad, and I in a group chat. So that is the last I heard of him. Right now I don\\'t know exactly where he is, but I do have a little bit of fear that he may come after me. He did leave his car at our house as well. I just feel like he is too unpredictable. My Dad is handling that restraining order process, but I\\'m not too familiar with how that all works. I would appreciate any advice from anyone on how to go through this.\\n\\n**Part 2** \\n\\nBased off the events that happened last night, I can say with 100% certainty that mental illness and addiction played a role in my older brother\\'s behavior. I know that a situation like this can destroy a family, and it absolutely will leave a scar on ours. But I want to be able to shine some light and possibly make something good out of this. I want to be able to spread the word on mental illness and addiction in my community. I\\'m a big fan of boxing and so I saw the [Interview](https://youtu.be/XrM6WqYEj9Y?t=188) between Tyson Fury and Joe Rogan, where he talks about his depression and mental illness, and how he is trying to spread the word for people who might be in a similar situation. This is very inspiring to me and I feel like I can do something similar. I am in my second year of college and I live in a city of about 170,000 so it\\'s not very big at all. A lot of people know each other around here, and some people have a big social media influence. I don\\'t use social media much at all or have many followers, but if that is what I need to use to get the message around, then I will. \\n\\n  \\nI want to be able to encourage people to seek help if they have mental illness or addiction to drugs or alcohol. For anyone that suffers from mental health problems the worst thing that a person can do is take drugs and alcohol. But that is the most common approach with dealing with it. And I\\'ve seen how it can destroy families and friendships. I had a best friend from the time I was in kindergarten who ended up getting mixed up with drugs and bad friends. By the time he was 17 he had a DUI and he barely graduated high school. I want people to know that there is a blueprint and a healthier way to deal with these things. \\n\\nMost importantly I want to be able to be a role model -  that my older brother never was-  for my little brother, who is 16 and in high school. I want to encourage him and the people his age not to go around and get caught up thinking that they need to be doing what everyone else is doing. Because we live in a culture that is glamorizes partying, drinking, and drugs that young people will see all over social media. I don\\'t believe that is a healthy way to live. I want to encourage these young kids and people of all ages to become leaders and people that leave a good example. And I also want to learn alongside them. So I would also appreciate any advice on how to approach this goal that I have. \\n\\nIf you made it to the end of this post I thank you very much for taking the time to read this. I have faith that I can do everything in my power to make some sort of difference. '),\n",

       "  'This will absolutely be long-winded. I am incapable of keeping things brief.  \\n  \\nI have suffered from depression for a while. It started my sophomore year of high school, and was already festering when I entered college.  \\nFreshman year of college, my alcoholic emotionally abusive father passed away unexpectedly, and it hit me very hard. I had believed his death wouldn\\'t affect me too much, but that was because I was young, naive, and (as always) trying to protect myself.  \\nAround a year ago I woke up with a feeling of dread and absolute misery. The weight of depression was tangible, and I called off work because I knew that I couldn\\'t make it through the shift without breaking down. Instead I drove to my girlfriend and my apartment and tried to hang myself.  \\nOur cat came over at once and began to meow loudly while he wrapped himself around my legs. I stopped and brought him to bed and just cried. I still to this day worry that I only did it to convince myself that I was truly sad.  \\nMy girlfriend rushed home as soon as I called her. She was not angry at me for getting fired (the bosses decided I had missed too much training due to my girlfriend and I just getting back from out of state for her grandfathers unexpected funeral). She was not disappointed in me. She just wanted to take care of me.  \\nShe told me take my time finding my next job because she didn\\'t want me to feel pressured, and her job paid well enough to support us both.  \\nI allowed my depression to swallow me whole, and I proceeded to go unemployed for 6 months. I was always searching, but I let my fear and self-pity keep me in bed for the vast majority of the time. I didnt know what I was supposed to do.  \\nShe had always expressed interest in moving across the country to live closer to her parents and grandmother. Around 4 months of unemployment, I agreed. I think I was hoping to help her to have a better support system in case I had another potentially more fatal breakdown.  \\nSo we moved across the country. And, as I\\'m sure none of you will be surprised by, depression came along for the ride.  \\nSince then, I proposed to my girlfriend. It took a very long time for me to make the decision. Our relationship has gone through some fairly severe ups and downs. For a long time, I convinced myself that I didnt want to marry her because we had too many negative memories between us.  \\nThen I started to realize, I was just afraid, as I always am. She is not perfect, but she is perfect for me. She cares so deeply for me, and her endless, determined love for me is larger and better than every negative thing in my life, internally and externally combined.  \\nBut I have been and continue to be afraid that I am cursed. Destined to stew in my own despair and self-pity forever. I dont want to drag her down with me.  \\nBut she convinced me that we could make it through together. And when I think about the rest of my life being with her, it suddenly isnt so bad.  \\nI want to get better for her, and be a good husband and eventually a good father; I just dont know how.  \\nI have been job hopping since college at different businesses that I am miserable at. Places that treat me like crap, or bore me to death.  \\nEvery time I look at job opportunities, my heart tells me that I am supposed to be a performer. It is my passion, and it is the only \"career\" that I am actually happy doing.  \\nBut I can\\'t trust my emotions or my gut feelings, because depression has left me feeling numb for a while now. When I\\'m not with my fiancé, most of my emotions are mentally concocted based on what I believe I should be feeling. I only feel comfortable to be myself when I\\'m with her.  \\nI am going to be her husband soon, and I dont have any idea if I\\'m going to be pursuing performance art, working at a 9-5 job just so she can have stability, or if I am determined to job hob for the rest of my life. Not knowing is excusable (who really knows what the future holds), but it is my fear of failing or making the wrong choice that is preventing me from going forward with anything concrete.  \\nMy fiancé has allowed me to take time to focus on being an actor but every time I try, I am incapable of fully dedicating myself, lest I risk discovering I\\'m not good enough.  \\nI am currently on depression medicine as well as thyroid medication. I try to take it consistently, but I miss taking them at least once a month.  \\nI have OCD, dermatillomania, anxiety, and often mood swings (but not bipolar). I often go months without brushing my teeth or showering. For some reason, I do not smell bad, but my teeth are starting to show signs of neglect, and it\\'s also just disgusting.  \\nI occasionally will think about doing them, but I never can find the energy. I do not feel a sense of accomplishment after taking a shower.  \\nBut, more often than not, I wont think about showering or my teeth, or my medicine, etc, for days. I\\'m just on autopilot, focusing all of my energy on making sure I go to work and dont get fired.  \\nI have seen multiple therapists before. But I have never stuck it out with one. I am so afraid of opening up to someone week after week, and hearing their advice.  \\nI wont let myself succeed. It\\'s too scary to try, so I throw a wrench into the system before I can risk failing and the waves of self-loathing that will follow.  \\nThe job I am at now is awful, but the insurance is incredible. I am trying to stick it out so I can go see a decent psychiatrist and have my medication reevaluated.  \\nI occasionally look for acting jobs, but I haven\\'t brought my best to an audition since college.  \\nI don\\'t know why I\\'m posting my life story on here. I\\'ve been very sick this week, but still had to work 40+ hours at my very physical job. Today is my Friday, so maybe this is just my release now that I finally dont have to return to work tomorrow.  \\nI dont expect anyone to have the magical answer for me. No simple solution exists that will make it all better.  \\nBut I hope people with similar experiences can give me some advice. Any advice.  \\nI am trying to get on a diet to help me lose weight (I have always been overweight), I am working constantly so I\\'m at least helping to provide for my fiancé, I am constantly analyzing my decisions and actions to see if I could improve or at least apologize when i am wrong. I have gotten a dog because I thought having a best friend that will motivate me to get outside every day would help me get better. I am trying to exercise more, eat less fast food, and not make suicide jokes.  \\nBut I also am just quitting smoking again, smoking pot 4+ times a week, sleeping in until my 1 PM shifts start, picking, not bathing, and not excelling at my job because I\\'m constantly zoned out during every shift.  \\nIn the back of my mind, I think I unfortunately still believe that there is a fix all. Moving across the country, marrying my soul mate, getting a cat, getting a dog, using marijuana, changing medicine. I keep hoping that I\\'ll just find the cure that makes me all better. But the thing that really scares me is that even with every one of those things in my life, depression is still crushing me. I feel like I\\'m running out of ideas on how to fight back. And it\\'s been so long since I\\'ve been without depression, I don\\'t really know who I am without it. It\\'s oozed into the foundation of my personality. When I occassionally have a big mood swing and I suddenly don\\'t feel depressed at all anymore (usually this happens once every 3 months, for an hour or two), I\\'m just insanely energetic and incredibly annoying just as I was in high school before depression was part of how I defined myself.  \\nRight now I\\'m focused on two main points: not letting the multitude of voices in my head take such a toll on me, and seeking help. I dont think I\\'ll be able to handle the former without first completing the latter.  \\nI am struggling to stay at my job long enough for the insurance to kick in, though. I am absolutely miserable there. But I feel like I have to go to a more expensive psychiatrist because I worry that if I go to a cheap one, they wont be able to assist me as well.  \\nI don\\'t want to be this way anymore. I want to be happy, successful, a great husband, and eventually a great father.  \\nI thought leaning on my fiancé was the solution for so long, but I eventually realized that she wasnt lifting me up from my depression, but I was dragging her down into it with me. I dont know how she wouldn\\'t, being with me 24/7 and me being constantly unhappy and talking about this.  \\nI still worry that I\\'m just lazy. My family has always told me that I\\'ve had a problem with laziness, similar to my late father. I dont know anyone else that is like me, so I cant help but think that maybe the majority of my depression is just enjoying sleeping for 14 hours at a time.  \\nI dont know if anyone will read any of this, let alone all 30 chapters. I cant seem to make/maintain any friendships outside of my fiancé, and I dont really have anyone to talk to about this. I hate bringing people down with my own shit, and I never people to see how self-pitying, repetitive, and scared I am.  \\nIf I feel like I am supposed to be a performer and everything within me tells me that it\\'s my destiny, do I follow it? Is it ridiculous? Should it be more of a hobby?  \\nAre there solutions that I have been missing and should be trying?  \\nAm I just a piece of shit and I need to just stop letting myself stew?  \\nIt\\'s okay if this doesnt get any attention. I\\'ll probably delete it (and this throwaway account) in the morning in embarrassment.  \\nI just dont know what to do. I feel like I\\'m trying so hard. I am trying to make steps in the right direction. But every time I look at my fiancé and see how much of a drain on her I am, I often wish that my cat hadn\\'t intervened. It would have been a horrible thing to do to my family, friends, and her. But I\\'m a coward, and having them watch me just stagnate and rot while I fail over and over and over again is too much.  \\nP.S. I\\'m not going to kill myself. I am sad, but my cat, my puppy, and my fiancé are already more than enough reason to keep trying. And that\\'s only a microscopic portion of the amazing things in my life I have to be appreciative for. I have a lot of good in my life, which makes it hurt that much more that I still am the way I am.  \\nOkay, if you actually read this whole thing, kudos. Why did you do it? Go get help for your masochism.  \\nGood night.  \\n  \\nTL;DR: I\\'m sad and I dont want to be.'),\n",

I wasn’t really friends with either of them until this school year when I started hanging out with their friend group. It’s a group of 6 girls and me and we are all sophomores in high school. At the beginning of the year none of them really did anything illegal or risky, but this year most of them started trying out stuff like vaping and drinking. I had already done those things so I didn’t think much of it. All of us in the group are ok with occasionally getting high or drunk as long as we’re being safe and careful. I know weed and alcohol are bad for teenagers but infrequent, safe use doesn’t have a bad impact from my experiences. Sarah and Carly are not very smart and a little boy crazy, so they don’t realize how dangerous these things can be. \\n\\nOver the past 5 weeks they have been going downhill FAST because they started spending time with this girl named Megan. Megan vapes at school, does lots of drugs, and steals shit from stores all the time. S &amp; C have been posting stories getting drunk with her almost every weekend, and they went to the mall with her and stole lots of clothes. Over spring break they got drunk 6 times in a week. They also started spending time with these senior boys, and I think they are influencing them too.\\n\\nThe rest of the group was talking and we were really worried about them, but also angry because they basically abandoned us for Megan. One of us tried to reach out to Carly by sending a text about how worried she was, but Carly kinda brushed it off. \\n\\nWe were going to just let them do their thing and hope they learn from their mistakes but after what I heard today I feel like I should do something. Sarah was drunk at a party a few days ago and she woke up to some guy fingering her. She told us in class and we asked if it was consensual she said “I didn’t say no.” What she way saying made it seem fine to her but I could just see the guilt and sadness in her eyes. We also found out they stole stuff again and one of them got caught by the employees, even though they all had stuff and could have gotten in huge trouble.\\n\\nI honestly don’t know what to do. From what I’ve said they probably seem like horrible people, but they used to be super nice girls.

They give each apartment one air conditioner and choose which window it goes in; ours is in our bedroom.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLast year, I moved into the apartment in the late summer when my boyfriend and I moved in together.  He had already been living there.  I noticed a funny smell when the air conditioner was on, and so I looked at the plastic vent blades and saw what I thought was some mold.  I notified the apartment manager, and she sent a maintenance person who looked at it and told me it was dirt.  I have a picture of his report saying it was dirt as well as pictures of the air conditioner.  Not long after, they removed the air conditioner, so I didn't bother worrying about it anymore until last week when they put another one in for the summer.

This is also going to be long because these events have all happened over a decade plus.\\n\\nI met my girlfriend Chloe in 2008 through her boyfriend at the time, James. I bonded with James over shared interests and similarities in our upbringing. We were both really into gaming and climbing, we both grew up Mormon and later left the church, etc.\\n\\nI really liked James. We played video games or climbed together twice a week, checked in through text daily, and he introduced me to his friendship group, including Chloe. I\\'d just moved to town and I didn\\'t have any other friends or family I was still in touch with so it meant a lot to me. The thing about leaving the church is that you\\'re sometimes cut off by your family and friends who are still in the church and that was the case with me, so you tend to form pretty close connections with other ex-members as a result.\\n\\nAnyway, when I initially met Chloe, I didn\\'t think much of her. I just saw her as my best friends girlfriend and nothing more. She was really friendly, but so was everyone else in the group, a lot of them being ex-mormon. Chloe wasn\\'t.\\n\\nAround a year after meeting James, he showed up at my place in the middle of the night wasted, with no shoes or socks on, and a big scratch across his face. I know I\\'m talking a lot about the church but it\\'s relevant; when you leave you suddenly have a lot of freedom to experiment and it isn\\'t uncommon for ex members to develop drug or drink habits out of binging to make up for lost time or to rebel or whatever. James was absolutely not that kind of guy. He\\'d drink a beer or two when we were hanging out but he was the kind of guy who\\'d sit you down for a talk about moderation if you seemed like you were going down a dangerous path with substances. Not to be interfering but just to see if you were okay- he was just that kind of guy. He cared, and he was cautious. He always said alcohol made him sick anyway.\\n\\nSo to see him slurring his words, hardly able to stand up, looking like he\\'d been in a fight was really unusual and really out of character. I helped him inside and he told me he\\'d left Chloe\\'s place because she\\'d been acting weird. I said he could sleep on my sofa, but before he could get settled, Chloe showed up. She was calm and sober, and she asked to come inside. I didn\\'t think anything of it, so I let her in. The second she got inside she sprinted across the room and jumped over the sofa to land on James and she just started hammering her fists down against his chest. It was 0 to 100, she was calm and polite one minute, and completely feral the second she caught sight of him. I pulled her away and threatened to call the cops, and she instantly calmed down again, apologised, and left. It was surreal.\\n\\nJames said he was fine and after talking a little, we just went to sleep because he wasn\\'t that coherent anyway. The next morning I really struggled to wake him up. He was extremely disorientated and didn\\'t remember anything at all about the night before. I know we had a conversation about how much he\\'d had to drink and he said he\\'d only had one beer. I know I didn\\'t believe him and we had a conversation about that. I\\'m pretty sure we talked about moderation and coming to talk to friends instead of turning to substances if we\\'re struggling etc. But I know he insisted it was just one beer and I know how much I doubted that.\\n\\nWe also talked about Chloe and her assaulting him, but he told me that it wasn\\'t what it looked like and he\\'d done something awful. I asked what he\\'d done but he didn\\'t want to talk about it. He just insisted that he\\'d done something awful and she was justified in attacking him. I didn\\'t necessarily agree, but I didn\\'t push the issue. I wish I had.\\n\\nEverything went back to normal after that, but Chloe became pretty cold towards me which made things uncomfortable. I still saw James, but I noticed he was more subdued in those last few months. At the end of 2010, I moved across the country. I\\'d been in an LDR for a while and wanted to be closer to my partner. I stayed in touch with James for a while mostly through social media but it wasn\\'t as big as it was now. We text occasionally too, on birthdays and holidays, but eventually his texts stopped coming. I do remember feeling bad about it but it was just one of those things. Not every friendship from your teens-early twenties survives. I stayed in touch with two people from that town but no one mentioned James to me and I just assumed he\\'d gone on to do his own thing when his social media profile went inactive.\\n\\nIn late 2015/early 2016 I moved back to town when my relationship ended. Literally within my first week I ran into Chloe. She was a completely different person and she didn\\'t seem cold towards me at all, she was really happy to see me, and honestly by then I\\'d forgotten most of the weird stuff. I asked if she was still with James and she told me he\\'d moved back to his parents year ago. We swapped numbers and arranged to meet up for a drink.\\n\\nShortly after, I caught up with my friends from the old group Chloe, James, and I had belonged to. I mentioned that I was going out for drinks with Chloe soon, and they were all shocked she was still in town. They\\'d not seen her for years, and assumed she\\'d left with James. They told me that one day James just upped and left. His apartment was empty and he\\'d just ghosted them all. No one had heard from him since, but someone had heard he\\'d gone back to his parents, and someone else had heard he\\'d moved to Europe to teach English as a foreign language or some shit. I thought it was weird, but not unbelievable.\\n\\nWhen I went out for drinks with Chloe, I asked why she\\'d ghosted everyone, and she said they\\'d never been her friends, they were James, and when he went home, people just stopped inviting her places. She said if they didn\\'t make the effort, she wasn\\'t going to either. It sounded fair enough to me. Shortly after that, we ended up getting into a relationship. One on one it turns out we\\'ve got a lot in common and have the same sort of edgy sense of humour, music taste, etc. It\\'s actually insane that I didn\\'t notice how much we had in common before and I\\'ve been really happy with her since.\\n\\nWe moved to a new state this year and we\\'re building a life together. We\\'ve got a dog and we\\'ve been talking about marriage, kids, the whole package. Until recently, I\\'ve honestly been seeing myself with this girl for the rest of my life.\\n\\nBut here\\'s my problem. Chloe has always made sort of uncomfortable jokes. She\\'s the type of girl to jokingly say stuff like *I\\'ve killed before, you shouldn\\'t test me!* and other obvious jokes, usually about taking no shit from men, etc. If she sees a story about a girl being cheated on for example it\\'s always *I\\'d cut his dick off haha!*\\n\\nI don\\'t like that kind of tumblr girl humour, but it\\'s her life, she\\'s always seemed like she\\'s kidding. Sometimes the jokes are directed at me, like recently I\\'ve started getting into following cooking recipes on YouTube. She\\'s usually the cook in our house but I\\'m making more of an effort. She came home to find me cooking recently and joked that she was going to have to find a new way to poison me now.\\n\\nThe only time she\\'s ever seemed serious was when I mentioned that an online friend had invited me to a pride month event. She lost her shit and accused me of sleeping with my male friend. I\\'m bisexual but we\\'re online friend and we\\'ve only met in person twice- she was there both times- and regardless I wouldn\\'t cheat. During this argument she said she was going to kill him if he ever came near our home again.\\n\\nOther than that, nothing major. But two nights ago, her sister spent the night. I gave them some space to have a bit of a girls night, and ended up playing some games, talked to online friends, etc. At one point, I headed to the kitchen to get a drink and passed the living room. I stuck my head in to say hello and see if they needed anything or whatever.\\n\\nChloe\\'s sister joked that they\\'d just been about to send out a search party for me. Chloe then said \"God, not even James got a search party when I was through with him. All he got was an unmarked grave.\"\\n\\nHer sister looked a bit uncomfortable but laughed anyway. I left them to it, but the comment kind of made me think twice. She laughed afterwards, she\\'d been drinking, and she makes edgy jokes all the time, so I tried to convince myself that was it, but I couldn\\'t help but wonder. So, I looked him up again. There are no new profiles, just the old profile I\\'m still friends with. He last updated in 2011, and it was to change his profile picture from one of him and Chloe to one of just him, so I\\'m assuming it was around their break up.\\n\\nI also reached out to our mutual friends again, and all confirmed that they hadn\\'t heard anything, that James just ghosted them one day around 2011 and hasn\\'t been in touch since. One guy said he\\'d had plans with James the week he seemed to disappear, and he just never showed up. No cancellation or anything. Completely out of character; James was reliable as sin. Another friend directed me to his Mother\\'s Facebook. She has a few public posts. One post at Christmas 2015 was a throwback photo of James with his sisters captioned *we\\'re incomplete until he comes home!* Followed by her friends commenting to reassure her that James is probably fine, he\\'ll come around etc. It could just be a typical ex-mormon becomes estranged from family situation, but most of us stay in touch or at least check in. There haven\\'t been any posts about James since. I scrolled way down, and prior to 2011 there was a status saying she\\'d had a call with \"her boy\" in 2009 that made her happy, and I think James was the only boy, so it looks like he did make some contact. I found his sisters profiles too, and there\\'s nothing about James, but one has a cover photo of some quote about the bond between siblings and the other commented \"*J :( x\"* which maybe I\\'m reading into too much. I searched on every platform and couldn\\'t find a mention of him aside from profiles and posts pre-2011; his surname is really unique so you\\'d think there\\'d be something.\\n\\nSo yesterday once her sister left, I told Chloe I was thinking of contacting James family to see if they\\'d heard from him. She got instantly defensive and asked why. I told her he was my best friend at one point and something didn\\'t feel right about him disappearing without anyone hearing from him. She said she\\'d heard from him and he went back to his parents. I told her I\\'d seen his Moms Facebook and it didn\\'t look like he\\'d gone home. She started to get upset, so I tried to calmly explain why I thought the situation was worth looking into but the more I talked the more distressed she seemed. She was torn between being tearful and being angry and when I said I was going to contact his Mom again she snapped and grabbed my shirt to back me into the wall. She\\'s usually really calm but I honestly didn\\'t recognise her. She looked like a different person. She told me that I didn\\'t know what I was digging up and I\\'d regret it if I kept looking. I asked her to let go of me and step back, which she did.\\n\\nI asked her to explain what had gone on between her and James. She said that shortly after I moved away, the relationship broke down after she realised James wasn\\'t the person she thought he was. She said he\\'d done some bad things and she gave him an ultimatum that was essentially disappear, or she\\'d tell everyone what he\\'d done. I asked what he\\'d done but she refused to tell me.\\n\\nEvery time I push the issue, she gets upset. I slept on the sofa last night at her request and she\\'s barely spoken to me today. I don\\'t know what to do. James has never seemed like a bad guy to me. He was always supportive and genuine, the kind of guy you instantly warmed to. Chloe\\'s the same, she\\'s a warm person you just can\\'t help but love, and she\\'s only ever lost her temper once when she attacked James. Part of me thinks he must have done something to provoke that kind of behaviour in her. I know you shouldn\\'t blame a victim for being attacked but knowing her I know it\\'s out of character. And he told me that night he\\'d done something awful.\\n\\nObviously, my mind has gone to the most extreme place and I\\'m worried James has come to some harm. Her joke the other night and her reaction to my research as a result of her joke just don\\'t seem rational in the slightest. I\\'d like to contact his family and try to locate him to be sure he\\'s safe, but Chloe has told me she doesn\\'t want me to do so because the way things ended greatly upset her and she now hates James.\\n\\nWhat do you think? Am I overreacting? Should I look into his disappearance or respect my girlfriend\\'s wishes? And how can I smooth things over if I am pushing at something painful for her? She seems genuinely upset with me.\\n\\nTL;DR - I met Chloe and James when they were a couple. I moved away and lost touch with both of them. When I moved back, I started dating Chloe. We\\'ve been together nearly three years. My girlfriend jokes about murder a lot. She recently joked about murdering James specifically. I looked into his disappearance and realised he hasn\\'t been heard from by anyone at all in eight years. My girlfriend says she made him leave because he did something bad and doesn\\'t want me to look for him. I\\'m worried she hurt him. Am I overreacting? What should I do?'),\n",

One night I was asleep and awoke to some noise coming into my room. It was the sound of one of my female flat mates that also lived on the top floor. She had just got home from a drunken night out. She was completely all over the place. She was whispering for me to wake up. I was still half asleep and expected her just to leave. Next thing I know I realised my blanket had been removed from on top of me. \\n\\nShe had grabbed my penis and was attempting to give me a blow job. I pushed her away. She kept coming back and grabbing at my penis. She was quite forceful and aggressive and kept begging me to please let her suck me of. \\n\\nI was really grossed out by the situation. And by the fact that this girl always tried to give off an air of superiority of moral ethics over everyone else. And yet here she was trying to force herself on me sexually. I managed to get her off and out of my room. At which point a few minutes later I could hear her snoring loudly in her room which was across the hall. She snores extremely loudly. \\n\\nI never really thought about it much after. It was never mentioned. I was so embarrassed by what had happened. And I never knew whether she was too drunk to remember. Years have passed. We lost touch. She was very toxic and I distanced myself. Only to then discover she is now a leading female empowerment activist for refugees and minorities. And gives talks on all of this. It makes me sick to think of what she did to me. And here she is now talking out against the exact type of things she is guilty of trying to do herself. \\n\\nIf a guy had done this to a girl at uni they would have been kicked out most likely. I can’t help but think if I had said anything no one would have believed me especially as it was a number of years ago now. But seeing her now trying to come across as this saviour of morality makes me feel nauseas. I feel frustrated that I still find it difficult to move on and just forget about it. I know if I ever confronted her maybe for some weird kind of closure or something, she would just deny it. \\n\\nI’m not sure how to feel about this and i think that’s why I’m writing.

However, I had to switch to homeschooling (and doing all my classes online) in the middle of high school. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but I hate my home and personal life. I live in my aunt and uncle's house because my mom had nowhere to go after she divorced my step-dad about five years ago.

       "  'What do you do when there are parts of your life you can\\'t change no matter how hard you try, or parts of your life you can\\'t change at all?\\n\\nTo start off, I\\'m a 23 year old female. I\\'m not a special person by any means, I don\\'t believe anyone is, however I have been through experiences and come from a background that had shaped who I am today.  \\n\\nI almost feel like giving up because absolutely nothing in my life has come easily. Every piece of my identity and every thing I have strived for has only caused me pain, suffering, and heartbreak. To begin:\\n\\n-  I come from a conservative religious background. My family is of this nature. I went through a great deal of difficulty and pain leaving my religion and having my family figure out about it. It was one of the hardest things I had to figure out and deal with in my life. It is made worse by the fact that I feel the 20 years of my life before that brainwashed by my former religion were a complete waste. This isn\\'t to mention the recurring mental issues I believe I still have as a result of it. \\n\\nI cannot come out as having left my former religion to my closest childhood friends because I will lose them if I reveal who I really am. I have to keep up appearances in my society and will never be able to freely speak out against what I believe to be an oppressive belief system, especially for women, if I want to keep my family and friends. This has resulted in me continually feeling suffocated, unable to express my true thoughts, and has given me a multitude of mental issues. What is one to do about this? \\n\\n- I come from a perpetually occupied country that is in a continuous state of war. It has no infrastructure, no money, no economy, nothing. I will never be able to return to it normally or travel through it freely, since there are numerous restrictions on those of my background to even enter the country. I have numerous relatives in jail and who have been killed because of these conditions. When I was a child I saw things a child should not ever see. How can I get over this? How can I get over never being able to live in my country or seeing it free? How can I change something that won\\'t ever change? \\n\\n- The consequences of leaving my religion left me in a constant state of paranoia, depression, and anxiety throughout my last two years of college, so much so that I feel these years were wasted for me since I did not truly enjoy myself or live my life. I isolated myself to focus on my studies much of the time only to be able to finally graduate and gain my independence. I gained it and some success. I would say this is the most positive outcome that has come about from the past 3 years of my life. \\n\\n-  My dating and relationship life has never been a success. Even with some friendships also. Despite the fact that I am described as sociable, attractive, fun and successful by my dates and otherwise, none of it has never worked out for me. I made a bad decision getting involved with a certain man once, it was a 2 year thing, but it was never a real relationship and he treated me so badly. I never anticipated what was to happen with the 2 men I seriously dated after him: they were kind and decent men, but I didn\\'t expect things to end the way they did at all. I\\'ve never gotten past 4 months in dating a man. All I get is men constantly hitting on me when I go out, so I can hardly go out alone anymore as it makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. Men have harassed me to the point of depression, since I feel I will never come across a man that will take me seriously like a human being. The times I have, it always ended abruptly for reasons outside of my control. Perhaps it\\'s due to my numerous \"issues\", but I can\\'t change those about me. \\n\\nOverall, this is the gist and shortest summary I could write up of all I have experienced and am going through. I have no idea where to begin addressing them. I have too many hang ups and issues. While my experiences have made me stronger in many ways, some days I get extremely depressed and feel I cannot go on anymore. Nothing in my life has ever come easy. I have so much pain inside of me from all these issues combined. These are the things that I think of when alone that seriously cause me depression. The only thing that alleviates them is pursuing a few hobbies that act as a distraction, and going out and interacting with friends and others, but I live in an unfriendly city that isn\\'t that open to strangers speaking to you. I don\\'t fit into one box and feel I can\\'t relate to many others I meet much of the time no matter how hard I try. I feel I don\\'t belong in this society no matter how hard I have tried to adapt. I feel torn between this new culture I am in and my original one which ha resulted in multiple identity issues for me. \\n\\nWhat is one to do about all this? '),\n",

Now, he's withdrawal rather than reserved, answering in grunts and generally being unresponsive. He seems disinterested in school work, has completely stopped doing art and spends all of his free time on the computer. He's also become lazy, sulking when he has to help around the house (much like our father), and has become quite rude; going as far as to spout racist and homophobic stuff. At first we thought it was hormones, then because he was bullied at school, but he's only getting worse. We come from a loving and supportive family: my parents have always supported our hobbies, passions and any side project us kids come across. They've showered us with love, time and attention. Our mother is one of the kindest people I know, and helped my brother through his GCSEs so much that she was basically doing the exam herself. He's so different now and I'm really worried for him. He seems to think he'll get whatever he wants without the work. My brother and I are constantly butting heads because of how rude he has become.

Recently in the past day she's repeatedly talked about killing herself and how she would love to end her life -- this isnt the first time she's talked to me about it but i feel like it's more serious this time. She's depressed mainly because she doesn't think she can achieve what she wants to achieve in life (successful career in America, being beautiful, etc.) because uni is expensive, etc. I have offered my help (financial, emotional, etc) and assured her she can do it and I will support her, and that she's beautiful, etc. But I can't convince her, she won't believe me, and she often refuses my (financial) help even though I make well over 6 figures. Her family is terrible and constantly put her down. In the past, she cut herself and almost killed herself, so her family got a therapist she visited once a month.  If she were in America I would get her counseling right now, but she's Japanese. I don't have her address or family contact info. I don't know how to help her. We met in Japan 2 months ago, after I left Japan we've been communicating via text and phone calls. What can I do?\"),\n",

       "  'This girl I liked for years called Lucy always treats me like a side piece.  \\n\\nBackstory is that I liked her for like 5 years. I told her 5 years ago I liked her and she rejected me but we were always close friends then last year we went to bed together out of the blue we were both drunk and we stayed up talking where I said that I liked her for years and she told me afterwards it was a one time thing\\n\\nIt was painful to go through cause I came from a ‘angry’ family if you get my drift and so this was the first time I ever properly felt real love which for those of you who don’t know is like discovering a new emotion. Very painful to get over as Lucy knew about the stuff with my family and when I told her I was struggling to get over her she told me that it was the emotion that I was struggling with and not her (which wasn’t true) and I guess that I felt like she didn’t want to ever deal with it again. I felt tossed aside as I would go home and have this emotion that I couldn’t handle. \\n\\nTook me a while to get over it but then on my 19th birthday she kissed me in a friends house and then she took me to a bedroom and closed the door saying goodnight which was confusing as I felt like she put me to bed. \\n\\nI learnt from my previous mistake and told her that we should stop talking as I needed to focus on university exams, she accepted it and acted like she didn’t give a shit. One week later I get a text from Lucy asking if was going to kill my self. At this point I’m extremely confused and ask why she thought that. She says that she learnt in her psych major that people distance themselves before attempting suicide (at this point I’m getting close to the end of my fuse as I have had mental health issues like PTSD depression, in the past but i got a handle on them after my sister told me to man the fuck up). \\n\\nI ask her to come to my dorms where I tell her that I’m fine but I want to move on from that part of my life and then she tries to use her psych major to analyse my family relationships effect on my previous romantic relationships, \\n\\nI bite my tongue as I think it’s super rude that she think her psych major means she can tell me that my parents dysfunctional relationship has impacted my ability to form good relationships with girls, she verbally trampled on all those terrible years to then spell out that I’m fucked up as a result (I’m rly not btw my past relationships have always been great and ended with friendship with all my exes).\\n\\nI have to stress how annoying this was, she says all the time that one of her favourite things about me is our ‘similar childhoods’ - our childhoods are not similar, she got depressed at 13 for a year and that’s it. \\n\\nI was beaten bloody at 11 by my father after I took some sweets that weren’t mine.\\n\\nI was arrested at 13 for a family fight where I fought back after my dad punched my mom and I broke his nose with a head but. I spent the night in jail at 13. \\n\\nI slashed my wrists at 15 in suicide attempt and woke up in my own blood 3 hours later. No one had even come to my room in that time despite being in a big family. \\n\\nI hung my self at 17 and the belt snapped. Otherwise I would certainly be dead right now. I spent the next hour on the floor half awake half not. \\n\\nMy point from this is that, I understand that she thinks we have similar backgrounds but in brutal reality check it’s clearly not so.\\n\\nReturning to the earlier conversation in my dorm: \\nI accidentally mention the kiss from my 21st and she tells me ‘we’re just friends\\n\\n I walked into that one and I promised myself that next time if she tried to kiss me again I would reject it and walk away as I knew that the damage to my self esteem would put me down for weeks. then at a uni dance the other night (were drunk) Lucy grabs my hand and pulls me close out of nowhere and leans close and asks me to be her last dance before she leaves. \\n\\nI pick up the signals and say ‘no I have to do something’ walking away. I don’t look back but when I’m outside having a cigarette 5 minutes later she walks out looking angry and doesn’t look at me despite me being in front of her. \\n\\nI just so happen to make out with her friend Clare that night after she leaves. It had nothing to do with her, Clare just happened to be into me. I later find out from a mutual friend that when she left she asked her group of friends if they thought anything would happen between Clare and I as everyone knew Clare was into me. They all said no and she went on. \\n\\nThe next morning were at a uni function and we walk past Lucy and her friend, I avoid eye contact (lowkey not obvious) and they both look at me and laugh which all my friends happily point out was directed at me.\\n\\n later my mate who also kissed Clare after me, brags to Lucy that he kissed Clare then casually mentions that Clare kissed me. I walk up in the middle of this and Lucy asks me if it’s true, I said it is. \\n\\nLucy says that she had ‘talked to Clare’ about this before the dance and so now I’m immediately picking up jealous vibes like she told Clare not to kiss me. I ask her to explain but she says she ‘obviously can’t’. \\n\\nI walk away with my mate and Lucy comes up to me and asks me not to have sex with Clare until the end of university in a few months. \\n\\nI’m shocked and say OK passively and later on my mate tells me that Lucy was getting irate about Clare to him, saying stuff like ‘fuck Clare for that’.\\n\\nI presume that she asked me not to fuck Clare because she doesn’t want to get jealous before she moves on somewhere else after Uni. \\n\\nI’m absolutely annoyed right now, not only did Lucy reject me twice she fucked with my feelings (accidentally I guess) and she clearly has feelings as she didn’t want Clare kissing me but when I reject her and her friend kissed me, she suddenly wants to set boundaries for me. \\n\\nI feel like she just wants me to sit in the corner like a puppy until she wants to kiss me. I have to say that rejecting her was the best decision of my life, it kind of showed her true character. I watched her kiss loads of guys and Although it was painful I didn’t dare get involved, now she can’t handle this one thing. \\n\\nAny advice would be helpful, I’m at a party with her tomorrow night. I don’t know what to do, I accepted all of emotional shortcomings as my own fault, I never blamed her for any part of my inability to handle my emotions. I do feel like she has been leading me on when she gets drunk. \\n\\nPls any advice would be amazing'),\n",

It\\'s kind of been omnipresent with me for the past year.  \\n\\nI\\'ll go over what i\\'ve gone through that caused most of this, and then I\\'ll go over my current emotions.\\n\\nIn high school (third year, but graduated as a junior) I was falsely accused of sexual assault\\n\\nFor context, I should say that I am a MTF transsexual, and for reference I was on hormones for about a year during the first story, and a year and a half on the second.\\n\\nanyways\\n\\nOver the summer 2016, me (MTF/16/junior, but graduating) and my best friend (M/17/junior)(we\\'ll call him \"Red\" because that\\'s what color I used to block his info in the screenshots) became really close.  It was the summer that Pokemon GO came out.  We would spend hours just driving around farming pokeballs, and stay out until like 4 am.  We often had many of those \\'deep as fuck parked car conversations\\' and i really truly cared for the guy.  It should also be known that I really had a crush on him since 6th grade as well, so yeah.  \\n\\nOn September 10th 2016, Red asked me if I wanted to come over to his place after a band competition, which I did.  \\nHis girlfriend (F/18/college freshman/\"Yellow\") at the time lived 2 hours away and visited every weekend.  So, he would\\'ve been feeling sexually deprived and I really didn\\'t expect anything to happen, because he knew me before I came out and I knew that was weird for straight guys, let alone me being trans within itself, so I was looking forward to an innocent night of Battlefront.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck 3 am, I called it quits.  I was exhausted from the comp day, and I just wanted to sleep, so I asked Red where to sleep.  \\n\"Well, we could either crash on the couch or sleep in my bed.\"\\n\\n*We*? \\nI thought that was a subtle bait, but I wasn\\'t quite ready to bite yet,  I remained skeptical.  So I walked toward his bed and laid down, him following suit.  He then proceeded to lock the door, reminding me that he always does that when he goes to bed because \"his step brother likes to run into his room to wake him up with annoying toys.\"\\n\\nNow this is definitely a subtle invitation.  He practically just told me that no one will interrupt us.\\n\\nWe watched Adam Ruins Everything while laying down, and we started to slowly cuddle.  I couldn\\'t believe it.  The guy I had a crush on for so many years, the guy I was practically in love with, is in the same bed as me!  \\n\\nOur fingers makes circles on each others skin, and he eventually pulls his shorts down and forcefully shoves my head toward his crotch.  We both enjoy ourselves until the deed is done, and then he gets up, cleans himself off and the rolls over and falls asleep.  I kind of start to feel inklings of guilt for sleeping with a taken man.\\n\\nThe next morning, he wakes me up; my group for my German Project is hounding his phone because they knew I stayed at his house.  I get up and leave, and once I get to the group location, I start to spill the beans because Blue(F/16) and Purple(F/16) started to pry it out of me.  They jokingly shame me for doing it with someone who is dating another person.\\n\\nLater that day, I message him and [this(these) conversation(s)](https://imgur.com/a/2BeX8) ensues.\\n\\nThe following days, Red and I are closer, but then one day, he skips school, but then a get a [message](https://imgur.com/a/orY0U) from Yellow, then Red starts [messaging me](https://imgur.com/a/kf4SV) as well.\\n\\nI start to feel ganged up on right now\\n\\nWhat I think happened, was that Red didn\\'t want to get into hot water with Yellow, so he tucked tail and decided to fabricate what actually happened between him and me.  And he didn\\'t want to be seen as a faggot that let a tranny suck his dick.  But the thing is that he instantly went from super close best friend to hating my guts, which was painful.  I loved the guy, and now i don\\'t exist to him, and it just was painful. (not to discredit what Yellow is feeling, but yeah) . Also, Red and Green(M/16) become much closer friends . But to deal with the emotional pain, I start self harming and abusing drugs.\\n\\nThis is also where Blue and Purple start to show themselves as \\'pot-stirrers\\' to get more drama going, which will be important later.\\n\\n\\nRed and Yellow keep on showing up my obligations.  Like they show up at marching band performances, and it\\'s never apart, they\\'re always together.  If your SO was raped, i don\\'t think you would keep on showing up with him to places you know the supposed rapist would be at, would you?  \\n\\nBut I keep on getting super frustrated, so I make [this post](https://imgur.com/a/VVt1Z), which Yellow immediately responds to [in my DMs](https://imgur.com/a/RRRqF)\\nEventually, some online rando comments \"Do you need me to kill someone?\" in a hyperbolic sense, as a form of support, but Yellow took that as a literal death threat and started telling people I had a hit out on her\\n\\nA couple weeks pass, and in october, I attempt [an apology](https://imgur.com/a/jhb4n) to Red, and didn\\'t go over so well\\nHe blew up on me, and made me feel so awful about myself, that I attempted suicide.\\n\\nSo on New Years Eve, Green comes over to my house, and we play some games together, but I tried to cheat on my then-girlfriend with Green, because she lived about 3 hours away, and we only visited an hour at a time, so I didn\\'t get any sexual relief, and Green was at my house and he was right there, so we almost did something.  He rejected during the initiation of the sexual encounter, saying that we shouldn\\'t, alluding to me having a girlfriend.  Which then I stop,\\n\\nIn January 2017, I [message Purple](https://imgur.com/a/EsZaH) to ask for her advice, and she\\'s upset with me, understandably,\\nThis is where it\\'s revealed that she knows about NYE\\n**important note**, under this context, Purple knows about NYE and seems to be under the presumption that it was consensual.\\n\\nFast forward to May 5th 2017,  We have a Pep band performance, and Green asks if I could take him home because he couldn\\'t find his original ride, so I agree to take him home.  I see that he found his original ride, so I assumed he\\'d be riding with him.  \\nWhen I leave, I see Orange(F/16) leaving to walk by herself back home, which I tell her that I could take her home if she would want me to, so she gets in my car.  \\nOnce I start to leave, Green jumps in my car will it\\'s moving because he still wanted to come home with me, and then Orange jokingly says we should all go to Denny\\'s, so we do lmao\\n\\nWe end up staying the night at our house, and he puts on a pair of my sweatpants because he was wearing kakhi pants, and we all kind of start cuddling, partially nude, while watching Netflix horror movies.  Anyone with any sort of sense could see that something would\\'ve been initiated. Which it does.  Orange and I start making out with his body and felatio is initiated, but halfway through, he jumps up and says No, so we both stop, and he gets up and walks home at like 3 am.  Orange and I are shook, and I get really upset because nothing like this happened to me before\\n\\nHe [messages me](https://imgur.com/a/sTnIx) the next day.\\n\\nFunny thing is, all the rumors going around school have nothing to do with Orange (a cisgender female), everything is about how I violated Green, which makes this whole thing feel like a personal attack against me.  \\nI feel genuinely bad about myself here.  I continue abusing drugs and self harming.  I don\\'t actively attempt suicide because graduation is coming up, but it was bittersweet because i didn\\'t have anyone to celebrate with.  I do have multiple daily mental breakdowns.  I was even sent home from my job multiple days because I couldn\\'t work.  I walked around school all mopey and shit so Purple and Blue start [harassing me](https://imgur.com/a/AnU8C) and started fabricating another accusation centered around the NYE encounter. Purple sees that me as playing the victim\\nEven though I have to eat lunch in the front office now, and literally all of my friends completely abandon me.  Hell, they even gaslit me so hard to make me believe I was genuinely a rapist.\\nThis is where I felt true and absolute loneliness.  Everyone I knew hated me, and pretended I didn\\'t exist.  It was truly the lowest point I have ever been, ever.\\n\\nGreen eventually wanted to drop it, and let me know through [a text](https://imgur.com/a/3WTdl), which I thought was very peculiar, but that didn\\'t fix the damage to my mental health, my social life, or anything like that.

The next day I woke up with no pants on, was sore and bleeding, and he was next to me).\\nI asked him that day what had happened and he said that he has 'tried to kiss me and things but stopped since I was too drunk', no mentioning of anything else happening. I went to a rape crisis centre, they found tears etc and basically I struggled to come to terms with it since I didn't have proper closure.\\n\\nA few weeks ago I finally told my best friend my suspicions (don't nag me that I should have told her sooner, I probably should have but it was hard) and she was devastated, she went to confront him and he ADMITTED to doing stuff to me, but tried to claim it was 'consensual' (then quickly backed down after my friend brought up what he had said to me). He denied having sex with me, however. Basically, my friend was upset and I tried to be supportive but struggled, especially when I found out she was still in contact with him. Anyway, we moved past that and they split up, but then a week ago she rang me up to basically say that she didn't believe me and that she thinks it was just a 'drunken mistake' and that I'm lying to try and cover my back. She is also friends with him still.\\n\\nNow, bare in mind that this whole incident has now gotten round the entirety of my sixth form (we are all 17-18, I'm 18 myself) and the vast majority believe me, yet she can't. I've played all my cards with her; she was there when he basically admitted to it and couldn't get his story straight, she's seen videos people have of me where I couldn't even stay awake properly on the night, she's been there when I've cried about it, the whole lot. This isn't me trying to 'cover my back'; I wouldn't have gone to a rape/sexual assault crisis centre, I wouldn't have started going to counselling or anything like that if it was just a 'mistake'.\\n\\nI've gone beyond the point of being angry about it with her, and she's completely isolated herself from me and our friends. None of them want much to do with her anymore either, but I considered her my closest friend for 12 years and I'm really struggling to come to terms with her accusing me of this. We have talked in person about it and she seems to have been brainwashed by him, she hasn't even got any reasons to not believe me according to her, she just doesn't believe he is 'capable' of it (bare in mind another girl has accused him of rape before this, plus someone else has also accused him of sexual harassment, which I found out recently).\\n\\nI don't think I could ever fully work it out with her but should I completely wash my hands of her?

And I still have not started a single game in all my years of football , I’d classify my years like this 7-9 grade learning years .... these years I wasn’t very good and was still acquiring skills and becoming more athletic . I loved football so I started working out and training  to get better I got my first gym membership after 8th grade season going into jv and started to increase my strength and athleticism and then going into 10th I improved a lot athletically..That last year on 10th grade JV I had my most enjoyable year I was in the discussion to start I ultimately didn’t but practice was fun I was trying to compete for a spot and was working hard I loved trying to get the spot and throughout the season I improved even more and at the end of the season the coaches told me I might be able to contribute next year on varsity where I currently am ... so after the 10 th grade season I hired a athletic trainer I loved going the facility and training and getting better and at this point I’ve become very athletic maybe not the most athletic at my position but definitely can compete with my positional teammates ( I play wide receiver ) .... anyway summer starts and we start having offseason workouts camps and such I’m doing well I enjoy it for the most part .... some practices suck especially when they get too two a days , but I endured it and during that time the varsity coaches were impressed with me getting better since I’d make plays in practice and they were telling me I could maybe get on the field if I keep balling out ... so I liked to hear this and still liked playing for the most part .... but slowly throughout the season so far the last three weeks too a month I’ve been falling out with my sport ... it’s a grind practice during the school year is rough ... I wake up at 6:20 go to school from 7-2 then wait in the school until film practice at 3-4 then field practice from 4-7 once I get home I’m in bed an hour or two later so I have a long day and on top of that practice is stressful .... I mean we get screamed out cursed at etc and when we condition it’s sucks .... now I know a lot of fellow athletes go through this it’s just sports so all this I common but it’s a lot harder to go through all this when you lose you passion for the sport especially when it eats up the majority of your day .... know I don’t know if I’m staring to fall out with my sport because I just out grew it or something like that or maybe I’m just burnt out from playing years and years never starting but constantly working hard and no results to get on the field ... especially this offseason with the trainer idk I dread going to practice i dread when coach tells us to start running and then we do it until we are literally about to pass out or when your scared to make a mistake or fuck up because you’ll get screamed at or make the team run.... I try to tell myself just push through the seasons not that long ( it ends give or take a couple weeks nov 1 ) i also know if I play my senior year I’ll finally start and play .... and I know most of my teammates don’t like  practice as well but they seem to just push through until game day where they can have fun  since they start \\n( and also don’t get me wrong I knew the feeling of not wanting to go to practice but this is different I really just hate it ) the kids that start love game days and I’ve always wanted to start and I know I will next year but I don’t even know what playing in a game feels like I question myself if playing for another year and half is worth it just play in game since I don’t even know what it’s like . This was kind of a rant so I’m sorry... it’s all so confusing too me I just feel burnt out and I don’t know what to do\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit : I even faked and injury sort of I actually hurt myself to not practice  I said I pulled my hamstring and I just kind of beat the fuck out of my hamstring when I got home so I would limp and it would bruise but while i sat on the sideline i kind of wanted to practice again after a couple days I missed running routes and catching balls but definitely didn’t miss the running and screaming but once I came back the excitement was very short lived within I think a week maybe week and Half I couldn’t handle practice again and made more excuses to miss I was sick but exaggerated it but making myself throw up so my mom would let me stay home .... adding this in here \\n\\n\\nI forgot to add I love my teammates were a family and I love the atmosphere football has ...we’ve all been through hard times together and I love being friends with them and being on tell but if I quit I feel like I’m letting them down and family too'),\n",

My dad talked to me about what happened, from his POV, and wants me to tell my mom.\\n\\nI'm a 15 year old guy and I'm mainly worried for my family, especially my sister.  I won't do anything dumb or stupid, just looking for advice.\\n\\nTo start, my mom left to go somewhere (Most likely for finding out), before I knew all of this my dad asked me to help him and was saying his email got hacked, he asked me to go with him. I agreed and for some reason he took me to Office Depot, before we went in he said that my mom thinks he's seeing someone. We went to Office Depot because he was there that day before he came home and brought me there to talk to an employee to confirm he was there that day saying she saw him and there were cameras. \\n\\nGoing back home he claims he didn't do it, showing me his phone, he showed me his emails which was weird because it didn't show any sent emails. He showed me his texts and all other messaging apps, mainly his trading apps, like Craigslist and those selling apps. He's saying he got hacked and such. He wants me to tell my mom the truth and basically convince her. Going home my mother wasn't home and my dad said he's not going home and tell my mom to come home. When I got home I saw that his computer was on and it was on his email (when my mom saw it), I decided to do some research myself and went on it. (I know it was a bad idea, but I had to...) \\n\\nFrom what I saw. that a month ago he made a Craigslist post saying he wasn't getting enough sexually and was looking for someone... I read email responses from strangers asking about his info, when can you meet up, and the info he gave was right, location, info about his work etc. I got kinda mad and emailed this one lady he was talking to. All the links in all the emails were flagged on Craigslist and were down. One important thing is that on each email, it showed that they were all forwarded to my mom's email, whether he did that or my mom did, I don't know. I had saw enough and left, and haven't told my mother yet. \\n\\nThat night I stayed up late playing video games to just relax and heard my dads truck pull up in the driveway. It was about 2 am and I shut off my computer and went to my bed. He went inside for like 5 minutes then left. I went to sleep and woke up at like 3 am hearing my parents arguing, not yelling, but I could hear them. I couldn't understand what they said but I tried to ignore it and went to sleep. \\n\\nHe's going to quit his job apparently, he doesn't care he said but that will affect us a lot. He didn't get really mad which was different from him. \\n\\nIt is now a day later and I'm not sure what I should do, my dad texted me asking if I told her, I said no and he said I have to. He texted me again and I just ignored it. I'm not really sure what to do, I don't even know if I believe in my dad, he sounded sincere, he gets up at 4 am for work and gets home at around 6-8 pm, he doesn't have much time. But I saw the emails, whether they were hacked or not, all the info was correct, but they were all sent to my mom and he tried to show her the texts and emails saying he was hacked. I am in the middle of this, I'm pretty sure it's too late to stop, but I don't know what to do. Any advice or just thoughts would be nice, I got really lazy and didn't want to type this all, but if you ask questions I will surely clarify more and add more details. \\n\\nTLDR: My dad's claiming his email got hacked and someone was sending nasty emails, my mom found the emails and got mad.

This isn’t super serious, but I would really appreciate some advice right now as I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone I know about this. \\n\\nBackground: I [17M] was born with a heart condition that affects blood flow, and allows oxygenated and nonoxygenated blood to mix. It’s not as serious as it sounds, but we’ve been monitoring it my whole life and because it’s a rare condition, we held off on fixing it until the medical procedures improved. Now, the procedure is relatively pretty safe, with only a 1-5% chance of any complications, so this year year, we decided to take the step and finally get surgery to fix the issue. \\n\\nThat surgery was supposed to happen yesterday, but unfortunately, I caught a cold over the weekend and the doctors decided it wouldn’t be safe to go through with the operation, so it was postponed by a minimum of 6 weeks. Inconvenient, sure, but since it’s not a medical emergency there’s no physical problem with delaying things a little bit. \\n\\nThe problem is my mental state: even though it’s a pretty safe procedure, it’s open heart surgery, and the recovery is pretty rough. I don’t even want to think about what will happen to me on that table. To personally become okay with undergoing the procedure, I had to make my peace with the world, and enter this headspace where I’m perfectly fine with dying. It’s probably not healthy, but it’s all I can do to keep from flinching at the sight of an IV or panicking and flailing when it’s time to take anesthesia. \\n\\nUnfortunately, though, the surgery obviously got postponed. I woke up yesterday morning with full acceptance of my (realistically unlikely) death, and I had spent the last week going through life like each thing I did would be the last time I did that thing. I was 100% prepared for the worst, and now... nothing. I still have the residue of that mindset, of making the surgery synonymous with dying, and I’m finding it really difficult to find any motivation for anything right now. I know that probably, I’ll be fine, but it’s the not knowing that’s weighing on me so heavily.  I just feel so lifeless, and it feels like my only options are to try to return to my normal state only to go through that awful decline of mentality all over again or just kind of force myself through the next few weeks with this shitty attitude. \\n\\nI’m sorry if this post comes off as “angsty teen being angsty”- I promise that for the most part, I have a pretty positive outlook on life and the world. It’s just that in this situation, it’s absolutely necessary for me to assume the unlikely worst case scenario as fact for me to have no qualms about undergoing the procedure. I’d really appreciate advice about how to inject some meaning back into my life for the next several weeks, or better ways to handle the fear of dying, or even just some feel good pick-me-up comments. Thank you.\\n\\nTl;dr: Surgery was postponed, but I already prepared myself mentally for the worst-case scenario and now I’m stuck in that headspace. \\n'),\n",

I was hoping and praying to be off this Christmas Eve, but yet, here we are, I'm at work, and my wife and three kids are home.  \\nMy wife has been texting me various things about how much I don't care about her having a rough time with the kids, and that I'm too tired to even care about things in general...(to be honest, I'm lucky to get 5hrs of sleep, between putting our kids to bed, spending time with my wife, and our kids waking up early, so I probably do run behind on sleep).\\n\\nSo now I'm feeling like the only way to make my wife happy is to quit my job, come home now, and relieve her of her parenting duties for the day.  Obviously, I can't do that, but I'm feeling powerless to help her right now.\\n\\nAny ideas as to what I can do?\"),\n",

       "  'I’m a young person (23F) living in a big city (still with my parents) but have just been offered a great work opportunity and I need some advice. \\n\\nThe job is to become a reporter with a major news outlet in a small northern town with roughly 3500 people. It seems remote - there is not a lot to do, but the region I would be living in is very diverse both with people and the types of content I can be creating. It pays really well too (almost twice what I currently make), plus provides a car and a big subsidy on rent. There’s also some money given to you as a per diem to offset the expensive costs of food and internet in a northern remote community. It’s also big for my career - I would be the only person for 1,000 km in any direction and that’s important for my field to get on national shows etc. It’s also pretty in line with what I want my career to look like in the future. \\n\\nThe downsides though are pretty extreme. It’s cold for a good chunk of the year (read -45 Celsius and below sometimes). It can be isolating and there can be issues with internet connectivity, cell phone, and there’s no one for miles if you get into an accident on the road. It’s also a town with a very transient population - so if you make a lot of friends they leave often to bigger places and markets. It’s also hard to travel - flights are expensive in and out of the community and the nearest major city is at least 6 hours away in any direction. \\n\\nThe alternative is to stay in this big city with a decent job, but not something I love. I still live with my parents because I will not be able to afford utilities if I move out on my own, but I’m starting to build recognition and connections here that is also valuable for my career. There is also the possibility of more job options in this city if I stick around because it has a really healthy job market and possible advancements for young people. Plus, my friends and family are living in town and it would be nice to be near them. I also enjoy being out and about - going to drinks, shows, movie nights with friends that I might not be able to do in this small northern town if I take the job. \\n\\nI need some advice on this one because it’s a very difficult decision and everyone I ask is also confused - so please let me know what you think!'),\n",

I stay in the bathroom for 3 hours, try to make myself sick, isn't working, I can't go to bed because I can't sleep, can't make myself sick, so I have a constant feeling of nausea and vomiting but don't know when I'm going to erupt. And I know I'm not alone in saying this, some of us genuinely think the nausea/throwing up experience is one of the worse things ever. It is now 11am, my exam is at 2pm.
