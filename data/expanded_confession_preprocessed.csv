I’m hoping that writing some of them down can help me focus on things I’ve done wrong in the past and maybe even better myself through it. 

Over a decade ago I worked at a very popular Internet cafe in the heart of a major city. This place was extremely busy and was open 24/7.  Now on top of offering internet and computers, we also had a full kitchen, serving some pretty decent stuff. Full sandwich bar, desserts, drinks, any coffee drink, boba. Basically anything you can get at Starbucks + subway + a dessert shop, we had it. 

I worked the graveyard shift and most nights I’d spend my shift goofing around with a coworker, smoking blunts on the roof, going to the kitchen and making myself whatever I wanted, eating and drinking whatever I wanted, and then closing out the register for the morning shift. 

It started out innocently enough, we’d just eat and drink whatever we wanted while working. One day I saw my coworker stuffing a case of drinks and a whole cheesecake into the trunk of his car and I decided, fuck it. It’s on. 

My coworker and I then started going ham. Whenever people would come in and buy computer time, we would need to punch it into the register. We started punching it into the register and voiding it out right away to make it seem legit, we’d put the money in and give them time cards. At the end of the night when we balanced the register we’d just split whatever the remainder was. (We only did this when customers paid cash). We even started doing this whenever a customer bought food or drinks. Like I said earlier, this place was really busy even at like 3am on a weeknight. So most nights we’d pocket around $2-300 each.

On my way to a village where I would volunteer, I stopped at Kuelap in northern Peru. Kuelap is an ancient walled city sitting atop a steep mountain, abandoned by the Chachapoyas culture in the 1500s, now an archaeological site and  tourist attraction. Relatively few tourists visit it though, since most tourists go straight to Machu Picchu in the south of the Peru.

I'm exploring the walled city on my own, rarely seeing anyone else. There is an opening in the wall towards the back of the site, so I walk through. The view on the other side is quite lovely, overlooking valleys and mountains. I start to walk along outside the city walls admiring the scenery, no one in sight.

Something catches my eye - a strange white rock sticking out among the green grass. As I get closer, I realise it is actually... bone. It's the top of a femur (thigh bone). I try to dig it out a bit, I can't get the whole thing out but it's obvious to me that it's human. Humans have pretty distinctive femurs because we walk upright. I look around it the grass and find a human vertebra. Then another. And another. And another. I'm holding 4 human vertebrae. Finally, something else is poking out from the ground nearby. I dig it out. I'm holding a mandible, a human jaw. It's fascinating. The incisors (front teeth) have ridges along the edges at the back, like little shovels, a characteristic common in indigenous american populations. So that checks out. On one side, all three molars are present, including the wisdom tooth. So not a kid. On the other side, no molars, just smooth bone. I assume this person lost their teeth and the bone healed over before they died, hopefully a sign they lived a relatively long life?

I'm quite captivated by my discovery and inspect the bones, I look around but don't find anything else. Erosion must be bringing these up from their centuries-old grave. *That's so cool*, I think, *what a lucky find*. I rebury them, covering them together with a few inches of dirt, best I can do with bare hands, and walk back inside the city walls, continue with my visit, and then continue with my journey, as if nothing happened. Months later, it hits me. Holy fuck, *what kind of weirdo finds human bones and tells no one*???!

Why didn't I tell the visitor's office, or find a tour guide and let them know? What if it was an important scientific discovery? What if they weren't old bones at all?

Over time, I've felt increasingly guilty. I should have told someone. Archaeologists could have made sure the remains were properly excavated and preserved, or better yet, reburied at a safe resting place. Most likely the bones just washed away down the mountain after a rain storm, or maybe got walked on and crushed by clueless tourists. What haunts me is, what if another tourist found them and kept them as some sick souvenir (people are the worst)? I'd feel horrible. I could have prevented that. *Was I just too lazy*???

I'm very very sorry, dear anonymous ancient person, that I didn't do more to make sure your final resting place was safe and quiet.

He is fourteen years old, he has been with us for a couple of months.

We knew from the begining that he had emotional and behaviour problems, he has been in juvenile centers multiple times and he has done really horrible things.

He is really violent and auto-destructive but we had been coping with it well until now.

Yesterday, he just snapped. He had the most violent episode I have ever seen. He was being really rude to my wife and I told him: ""Show some respect to your mother, don't be like that"" (He had been cool with me calling her his mother before). He started shouting that she was not his mother, that he wanted to be with his real mom and that he hated us and his siblings (my other foster children).

I tried to calm him down, but he started to break down stuff and saying that ""he was going to hurt us all."" Then, he punched another kid (who was trying to talk to him) to the ground and started to beat him. I immediately stoped him, but he got even more violent to the point that I feared that he would cause some serious harm to my other kids.

My wife called the police and they took him to the police station for a couple of hours, nothing really serious.

The thing is that he is really scared to the police. Like really, really scared. I was told that he had a panic attack in the station to the point he peed on himself.

He is home now, but he has not said to us a single word since then; he has been crying all day long, refusing to talk with us

My parents were well off for a while and saved up a college fund for all of us kids. It was roughly $10k per kid I think. Anyway my parents were pushing me to get into college right after I graduated high school. My dad always said “you’re too intelligent to have your potential wasted by not going to college”. Well like most 18 year olds I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life and if I even wanted to go to college. He said to just take the first two years and then decide. I did attend classes for a few months but I was super bored as they weren’t even related to my major, it just felt like high school all over again. So I stopped going and worked at a construction job as a painter all day and said I was going to school, because I was ashamed to tell my father I dropped out of college. Well time came to pay for the next semester and I couldn’t tell him not to pay or else he’d catch my lie, so I just built a class schedule so he would pay. Then about a week before classes started I’d drop them all and have the refund check sent to myself, I’d moved into my own apartment by then.

I did this a few more times and then pretended I wanted to take a break for a semester or two. He was okay with this so that gave me time to formulate a new plan on whether to come clean or choose to do something else. I told him I wanted to try a coding school as I was now interested in coding and IT instead of engineering, this part is actually legitimate, no lie there. I was 20 by then so I figured I’m only 2 years into adulthood I’ve got plenty of time to get schooling if I wanted to later. Well I started this online coding school but quickly figured out that I’m not really into coding either. 

It’s about this time I was developing depression so I went to see a therapist, and she became convinced that I have Asperger’s. She said it’s very difficult to officially diagnose an adult, but she is very convinced that I have it. She explained that it can often cause depression, anxiety, lack of focus, difficulty socializing, odd behaviors like stimming, overstimulation, and very negative reactions to changes in routine or environment. It felt like so much of my life suddenly became clear. So much of my behavior ever since I was a little kid suddenly made sense to me. 

I told my dad this and he said he’s not surprised as high-functioning autism/Asperger’s appears to be at least somewhat present in his side of the family. I still couldn’t bring myself to tell him about college or about not being into coding school. He’s so adamant that I go to school that I felt like he would be ashamed of me if I told him, on top of being ashamed that I lied to him. 

Fast forward to present day, I’m 21 and I’m trying to get into IT so I can at least look like something came of coding school that I didn’t really do. I’m so tired of lying, but the amount of shame that would come from coming clean is enough to stop me from telling the truth. I live on my own and my parents don’t really bug me about school much anymore so I figure it will all dissipate with time. I might actually like IT, but I’m worried that not having schooling will make it very difficult to get in. I have a couple years of experience from working customer service in retail after I quit my construction job, but I’m nervous that it won’t be enough. If I can’t get into IT then I’ll have to start spinning a new lie, or else the whole thing might come crashing down. I’m running out of time as my supposed “graduation” date is in July.

I have no one to tell this so I thought I'd tell this on Reddit.

I'm a 14-year-old boy. I shifted from Almaty, Kazakhstan to Lucknow, India during the summer of 2016. I thought my life will touch new heights back in my home country, it did not. As soon as we got here, within a matter of days, my mother fell seriously ill with an infection in her brain leaving her pretty much handicapped for two and a half years from Sep 2017 to August 2019 so more than two and a half years. In this while, I became miserable. I was a happy-go-lucky, intelligent, funny little child but her illness has ruined me. I've gone from one of the happiest people in the world to full-on chronic depression. 

My classmates think I should be one of the happiest people in the world, with friends and at the top of my class and with a good social group. But I'm so tired of doing all of the things and looking after the home. My dad does not live with us as he had a business over there. In July 2019, my sister was born and she is one of the most graceful beings I've ever seen but since my mother is ill, I look after her a lot of times, from making milk to helping me, my mom and the nannies changing diapers.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost all control of my privacy, with 6 maids coming to our home, in and out. The uneducated ones, tend to shout a lot and scream with my sister providing even more sound. My mom can't seem to control things even though she is getting better, because even though the disease is gone, the side-effects remain. I've not gone back to my beloved Almaty in two and a half years. My dad comes twice a year. I'm left all alone with no one to tell my pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm going insane. Yesterday, an incident happened with ripped me apart with guilt. It was 1:38 A.M. and I was sleeping while my mother and the nanny were playing with my sis. My sis likes to fight with me a lot and plays with me a lot too. Her fav. game is to slap me on the face. She slapped me while I was sleeping. I pushed her so hard on the bed that she started crying a lot. And to see someone, whom I've worked so hard for, cry because of me, was devastating. Especially cause she is only one-and-a-half years old. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have weird dreams wherein I commit massacres, do torture, etc.. I'm a very feeble person, not at all strong, and am easily bullied. I'm only good at my social group and my personal life has ruined me. I can still have a good career due to my grades but will I have a good life? Will I be mentally stable?

When you have a kid. You’re responsible, for life. You give up all your free time. You give up your sleep. You give up everything. I’m sick of parents complaining how hard it is when they 100% brought it upon themselves when they decided to create new life.

But the complaining I can handle. I whine about stuff that’s my fault too. It would be hypocritical to only fault them and not myself/others.

BUT what is absolutely repulsive is deadbeat parents. My father left me when I was little and my mother committed suicide when I was 15.
My mother died because of mental health issues and other trauma, it wasn’t caused by the responsibility of raising children alone. But I wouldn’t be surprised if me having severe ADHD and MUCH less severe Autism Spectrum Disorder, had something to do with it.

My parents are free of their responsibility. And me, I have to suffer. 
My parents didn’t even see me graduate high school. I’ll never get another Christmas with them. It sucks.

I loved my mother, and even often feel bad for this resentment. She did so much for me when she was alive, and she loved me dearly. But the pain of abandonment stings too much. She was 18 and in a shitty place when she had my sister, and 21 when she had me, still hanging around shitty people and taking drugs. It’s no surprise my life and hers took the course they did. Having children at that time was a stupid fucking decision she and my father didn’t make. Because they were irresponsible and didn’t even bother to use protection. They weren’t even thinking about responsibility or children. They didn’t give a shit. Only for themselves, and their pleasure in the moment did they care.

Harsh Opinion: if you’re in extreme poverty, addicted to drugs, or have mental health issues. JUST DO NOT HAVE KIDS, go get a vasectomy, get your tubes tied. Don’t condemn more humans who didn’t ask to exist to pointless suffering.

I dont have a job because I cant do tasks right because I'll second guess myself and do it wrong. I've been accepted to a college, and made a commitment with a friend to go together. But I cant get a job, I dont have a car, and I dont know how to do apply for a dorm or buy food or do taxes or cash a check or write a check or anything. I feel ten years behind where I should be and I know I should see a therapist but I cant because then I'll lose put on time. I'm a terrible procrastinator, so of the hours of free time I have, I never spend it doing what I should, and if I'm losing out on a few hours a week, that will just make it worse. I am supposed to send 100 dollars to my college to tell them that I want to go before march but I dont know how. I've moved 8 times in the past 10 years and dont know how to talk to people. I physically cannot speak to someone about anything more than is absolutely necessary and I feel like life woumd be a whole lot easier if I could just be Autistic or something so I'd have an excuse to be so dependent on everyone and no one would expect me to function.

I dont understand anything and I dont know how to do anything.

Here’s why:

I haven’t seen one of my friends for so damn long. He’s been doing lotta drugs and alcohol, but he’s also been wanting to hang for a long time. That means a ton to me. He recently got his license, maybe only 2 months ago. But, the law says your not allowed to drive with someone below 21 or 25, 6 monthes after you’ve gotten a license. Regardless, he wanted to pick me up from my house and drive us both over to a mall to meet up with more friends. It’s easier to do drugs behind there. My father, whom is a former deputy, now an investigator, realized that the driving is against the law and was totally against it, as was my mom. I got pissed, since driving was pretty much how the plan was formed. So, instead, me and my friend came up with a plan and executed it. 

I got dropped off at his house by my parents (they decided not to coordinate with my friends mother). When I walked inside his house, his mom thought I had my own license and drove here myself (I’m 1 month away from my license driving test). My friend snuck out of the house while I talked with his mom and he got into his car. I told his mother that I was here to pick something up that I had forgotten. She said OK and I went on my marry way out the door. I walked down the street where my friend awaited. I got in and we drove off to the mall. 

We got to the mall were we hotboxed a friends car and got super high. We ended up driving erratically like fucking idiots and acting dopey around people. During this, I got very uncomfortable. It had been a long time since I’ve done weed with friends, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for it with more people I didn’t recognize. Plus, they were driving us around high and going 40+ miles above the speed limit. Ive been much more comfortable smoking in the woods, being chill and nowhere to act erratic. I felt sick, like I was gonna puke because of the situation I was in. I needed to get out of there fast. 

Me and my mother have a code word incase anything goes off the rails. I forgot in a nerve of panic and told her to text me “Why are you at the mall?! I told you not to! Get home ASAP!” As amazing as my mother is, she said those words digestivly as I’m sure she was mad typing those own words herself. I showed my friends and they got pretty freaked out. I was taken from the mall than one block from my friends home where I was dropped off and walked to meet my parents. I was silent the whole ride home with them. And when it came to telling them what happened, I lied. I told them the “mall text” was a nervous tick and I did it in panic since that’s specifically where they **didnt** want me to be. I instead told them I was at the beach, people got loud and I didn’t like it. I told them I walked to where they picked me up. And they believed me. 

I feel so guilty and awful. And I’m really bummed I got uncomfortable at the mall. I was actually having such an awesome time with just me and my friend and one girl. Like, we were actually enjoying ourselves. When more people came and we hotboxed and drove around, that’s when I got a bad gut feeling. I love my parents to death. They are so amazing. And I never get tired of saying that to them. I think I’ll tell my therapist about the situation, I’m not sure. Feel free to call me a fucking idiot or what a retard I am. In my defense, I actually really do care about grades and academics and a future career unlike a lot of my friends who have ruined there lives from even trying damn cocaine. I’ve never told my parents I’ve done drugs, I’m sure that’s the same with a lot of people. And they really do believe me. And inside, I hate that I lie to them about it. They take really good care of me and I love them to death. I will never turn into a badass’ for them or disobey because I think I’m better than them. That’s not me.

I know the title of this seems a little weird and all but please here me out on what I have to say about myself. I've been having trouble with myself these past few years, debating on whether I'm someone who's a scaredy-cat and not willing to confront others or someone the complete opposite. 

Well, it's more like whether I'm someone who's gonna be able to stand up for myself. I really, really don't know how to describe it. So I might as well paint a scenario for you all. 

Earlier today one of my friends in my discord group put me on blast for taking too long with lunch and basically being passive aggressive about it. I retorted back by trying to diffuse the situation. It went something like this: 

*Friend: ""Guys, @(my name) Takes 1 hour to get lunch. And he still isn't back.""*

*Me: It's not like I'm speed-running to finish my food man. I was also resting a little.* 

*Friend: No one takes an hour.*

*Me: @(friend) Can you not read? ""I was also resting a little"". Just like, let me rest mannnnn.* 

*Friend: At least tell me if you're gonna be gone for that long lmao.* 

*Me: You had @(other friend) and the others, me telling you in the first place would leave no purpose.* 

*Friend: Bruh they left so early, lmao.* 

*Me: Yeah, so if they left on their own, it's not on me. Don't put me on blast to the entire group just because your couldn't wait. Jesus bro. (sad emoji)* \[I was trying to diffuse the situation with a funny emoji\] 

Now after that whole interaction occurred, I started to over-think about things and with that came the panicking because there were friends in my group who liked to.. make fun of the things that we all say. For example, with the recent interaction between me and a friend, another one of our friends will come out of nowhere and say: ""Lmao, why you getting so worked up over nothing?"" or ""Why you being so sensitive?"" or ""It's not a big deal."" Stuff along those lines. 

While yes, this situation is nothing much and I may have come off as a little strong to something that was rather minor, I'm just.. scared, uncomfortable with the fact that my other friends would start making fun of me because I don't really take criticism well. It hurts me a lot. Like, I will be hurting for DAYS over something a friend said like: ""You're too sensitive"" or ""Stop over-reacting"" because in my mind, I feel as if I'm not over-reacting nor being sensitive yet being called these things just make me feel extremely sad and angry and I start building up grudges on people just because of something they said to me. 

I realize now that I've just typed up a bunch of gibberish and that I don't really know why I started. Even me typing this out now is scary because I feel that one of my friends who use Reddit will find this and share it to everyone and therefore leaving me vulnerable to their advantage. 

I try to act like I can take a roasts from my friends and not get angered by it. But deep inside, it hurts quite a bit. They always say stuff like: ""Get over it"" or ""It's nothing much, why are you getting sad and/or angry?"" The truth is, I don't know why. I just.. feel the emotions and they won't let go, even after a long while. 

I've always wanted to type this out for everyone to see on Reddit because I just wanted help for so long and to hear the opinions of other people about my current situation. I'm just scared. I act like I can take the things they dish out but in my head, I just want friends who would always accept me, never make fun of me or even just make me feel bad in general. 

I know that's way too much to ask but I just need help right now. I still have A LOT to write about, but I feel that this post may be a bit too long and it should be left to rest for a bit. I'm still scared about what my friends will say, think or do. I guess I'm just a sensitive, easily bruised person. 

I don't want to be like this, I always dreamed of being someone who simply could not give a fuck whenever they faced arguments or confrontation. I always wanted to be someone who would never back down from anything. I guess I'll never be that person then. 

Again, I apologize if this is rather long, I just needed to share my thoughts and feeling for this. 

And to the friend to eventually sees this. I'm sorry for sharing and sorry for being sensitive, I never wanted to be this, I never wanted to be someone who's so easily bruised emotionally, I never wanted to be any of this.

I had a neighbor (we'll call him, America) who would walk his dog late at night without a leash. Its very stressful because we have wild coyotes, and in the past several dog owners have been attacked. Last thing anybody wants is having their dog shot by mistake.

One day a neighbor yelled at ""America"" to keep his dog on a leash. Rather than accept his mistake, he walked 4 houses down and began yelling racist things at them. Most of it was ""This is America!""  ""We speak english"" (Hence my nickname for him)
And more inbred Bullsh*t.

The victims were hispanics but were more american and spoke perfect English than this idiot.

I decided to dig some info and found out this guy has a long history of being arrested. He also likes to touch drunk young women at bars.
He was a renter and the landlord was a friend of theres. They caused months of trouble in the neighborhood. After the conflict, he would walk around to all the neighbors and spread horrible things of this one family.

So.....i took matters into my own hands.


I knew where he worked, always bringing his company truck that the city prohibits.
I would call his boss and complain of his driving, i slashed one of his tires, and even took off his license plate.

Eventually his lease was up and moved out.
He had a green jaguar in an empty lot covered in weeds. I cut the break lines and dunked resin in his gas tank.

Once they moved and towed the clunker, i waited and snuck in the house.
They left the back door open. The inside was spotless.
I cut the breaker box and began unplugging electrical appliances/devices and cut all the cords. Close cut to where you need a new appliance, broke a few pipes in their water softener and cut those cables.

Took out several outlets and binded the black/white wires.

A week later the landlord came. His shouting tickled my ego. The house has been sitting abandoned for almost a year now. Just a lil longer and i can call and ask if its for sale.
And see what ""repairs""  it needs to negotiate.
